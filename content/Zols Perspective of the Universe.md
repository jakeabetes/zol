title: "Zol's Perspective of the Universe"
---
Zol is not well versed in the complexities of [[The Cosmos]]. Some individuals posses insights into the stars that others lack, but the majority of academic knowledge about The Universe is limited to a few things: 
- There are many worlds all across the stars, each with their own unique complexities. Some societies even exist as a nexus of multiple worlds.
- [[Zol]] is unique amongst these worlds, as it exists within the body of a dead elder god, [[Goh'zul]] one of the [[Great Old Ones]]   
	- This uniqueness makes it an enthralling thing to some who exist within [[The Cosmos]]
- Travel amongst [[The Cosmos]] is possible. However, [[Zol]] does not yet posses this technology.
- There is a place beyond the edge of [[The Cosmos]] called [[The Space Outside Reality]]. Almost nothing is known of it, but it is said to be where [[Illithids]] hail from.
	- It is also thought that whatever exists here, created [[The Cosmos]]
