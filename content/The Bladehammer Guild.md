title: "The Bladehammer Guild"
---Those who fight for a better [[Zol]]. [[The Bladehammer Guild]] is the largest guild in all [[The Three Corners]]. It is an organization recognized by every city, even [[The Glassius Reach]] knows their mission. Located on the very edge of [[The Grand Nothing]] in [[Tenzentak]]. 

The guild is made up of a core organization, and many factions within. Individuals can join up with [[The Bladehammer Guild]], and become members of one, or many of its internal factions. Full members of [[The Bladehammer Guild]] receive a thin flat medallion with a unique magical signature. No one of the public knows how these are made, and the signature is very hard to falsify. The faces of the medallions look like hammered metal, and the edges are bordered like a coin.

These medallions, often called *Slates*, are known all across [[Zol]]. Those who are venturing out into the world on some quest, mission, pilgrimage, or other type of adventure may use these medallions to gain favor by reputation of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. Those of the guild are expected by most to act fairly, and justly. A Slate will not open every door, but it will make it easier to find work, gain access to non public spaces, and show intent.

## Values
*"Together we stand."*

The ideals of [[The Bladehammer Guild]] paint a picture of a unified [[Zol]]. The guild is the product of the same thinking that brought forth the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. If we can bring down the barriers that divide us, we can rebuild all that was lost in [[The Undoing]] once again and live as free, prosperous people.

## Origin
Founded by the [[Alderian Council]]. Its name,  *Bladehammer*, comes from the ideal of rebuilding and reclaiming the world by hammer and steel.

## Structure
The guild is a massive and complex organization. It is headed by Captain Helg Corsair, and his supporting council made up of the leaders of every sub faction, and other influential members of the guild.
- ### Leadership
	- Captain Helg Corsair, who is a well respected dwarven man with a scarred face. As well as his supporting council.
- ### Size
	- The Guild is around 4 thousand strong, but greatly distributed all across [[The Three Corners]].
- ### Rules
	- Do not betray one's medallion.
- ### Admission
	- Joining [[The Bladehammer Guild]] is a difficult, but worthwhile task. Many high ranking members of the guild will carry orange tickets called guild passes with them. If they see someone in the world they think is worth of the guild, they can give them one of these tickets. A guild pass will take on from anywhere in [[The Three Corners]] to [[Tenzentak]] by way of [[The Iron Tracks]]. Once at [[The Bladehammer Guild]], these fresh faces can sign up for a job. These jobs act as a challenge, if the member of the guild they do the job for is happy with their performance, they are welcomed in as a permanent member. The factions within however each have their own rule about new members joining with them.
- ### Symbolism
	- A crossed sword and smith's hammer

## Assets
- [[Gilligan's Lift]]

## Relationships
- Largely appreciated all across [[Zol]]
- Allies with many other organizations such as
	- [[The University]]
	- [[Kerketh Academy]]
	- [[The Coven]]
	- and many more

## Factions
Some of the factions within the guild are:
- The Heavy Shield
	- A band of altruistic mercenaries who fight to protect the common people 
- The Second Heart
	- A network of unassuming spies who seek to weed out corruption
- [[Kerketh Academy]]
	- A dispatchment of the academy within the ground of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]
- [[The University]]
	- A dispatchment of [[The University]] within the ground of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]
- The Repariat
	- Those who seek people and places who have faced destruction that was not stopped. Here they provide medical aid, resources, reconstruction, and defense if they can 
- Gilded Heart Mercenaries

It is worth nothing that there are many individuals within the organization who do not associate with a faction. They merely identify with the guild as a whole.
