title: "Kierketholl"
---*The Capital City of Humans, Shrouded in Mist*
![[kierketholl skyline.png]]

The capital of [[Kapesh]] and home to [[King Galliard]]. Dotted with massive, high towers and protected by [[The Crown Titans]]. [[Kierketholl]] has stood against the trials of war and time like no other city.

The city is filled with significantly tall buildings, and a handful of megastructures. Most buildings are at least 4 stories tall while the mega structures are around 30 to 50 stories tall. These complexes are all unique, some of which contain their own microcultures, and individuals who spend nearly their whole lives in a single building.

| Keeplings | Microcultural Group | The name given to those who live within Keep Galliard, the largest of the megastructures. This group is made up of nobility and their servants. Despite the structures size, the group is the smallest of the lot as all amenities within the tower are grand in scale. |

## Authority
The city is overseen by [[King Galliard]], ruler of [[Kapesh]]. However he lets the day to day of the city be run by his advisor Lord Ferd Aaron and the royal council.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].

## Modern Importance
Kierketholl is the capital of [[Kapesh]] and home to many. Despite it being a human kingdom, the sheer size of the city, and relatively costal location has made it relatively diverse compared to the other cities of [[Kapesh]].

## Historical Importance
Despite many of attacks during the [[Triumvirate Battles]], the city has held against every attempted attack. This is largely because of [[The Crown Titans]], a powerful legion of fighters that responds only to [[King Galliard]]'s command.

## Other Things of Note
- The Megastructures of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Riverbridge]]'s Great Bridges that span the [[The Narrow Sea]].
- The relationships amongst the human and non human population within the city are tense, and not overshadowed by the strange cultures of the mega structures
