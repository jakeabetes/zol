![[Ralatas prince of beasts.png]]

Lord of the forest, god of claw and fang, master of the hunt. Ralatas the prince of beast reigns as the powerful overseer of the harsh wilds, and those who make a home in it.

Taking his throne from his father, Ralatas is the successor of the mad [[Kerndall, the Feral King]].

## Depiction
Ralatas is depicted as an elegant beast, adorned in a floral crown. Most famously taking the form of a massive wolf, Ralatas is also know to be seen as a god-like form of any beast.

## Symbolism
A single fang with three dots arranged in a triangle.

## Behavior
Ralatas is known for maintaining the natural chaos that nature provides. A place without the laws and the systems of mortals. He seeks to keep as much of [[Zol]] as he can unbound, allowing the natural laws of nature to unfold.

Is known to be amicable to [[The Lifeweaver]].

## Realm
Resides in [[The Pure Forest]], the same realm as [[The Lifeweaver]]. Ralatas is known to spend much of his time in a rock formation and series of caves that resembles a castle some-what. 

## Worshipers
Followers of Ralatas are usually mystics, druids, tribes, and other social oddities. Formal worship is not practiced. Relations with Ralatas manifest more as a way of life involving hunts, and spending most of ones time in the natural world.

## State of Princedom
Ralatas succeeded his father [[Kerndall]] when the once king attempted to expand his domain by converting society to beasts. He did so by manufacturing a disease called [[Beast Ire]]. A condition that caused madness and mutations. Converting mortals into feral beasts who hunted their own kin. Devouring hundreds and spreading the disease to others.

The disease eventually mutated in such a way where it could infect beasts as well. Causing them to take on horrifying forms. [[Kerndall]] was forced to contain the ailment within himself to save [[Zol]]. Maddening him and turning him into a horrible monster now under the control of [[The Wasp Eater]].

Ralatas will not take the title of king until his father has been slain.
