# The Cosmos
*Beyond the [[Planes]] of [[Zol]]*

Reality itself. [[The Cosmos]] is the endless expanse of many magics, gods, and worlds alien to [[Zol]].

Little is know of The Cosmos. Traversal outside [[The Great Wall of Roots]] is difficult, and long term voyages even more so.

Many speculate and wonder what lies amongst the stars, but sadly few resources are spent researching. Danger and wonder lies in the expanse of space, but there are many more pressing questions closer to home. [[Zol]] must first answer them before truly voyaging beyond.
