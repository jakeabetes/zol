title: "The Anger of the Stars"
---A strange phenomenon that some fringe academics, and occultists devote much, if not all of their lives to. It is said to be a magical influence that radiates from the cosmos. Its influence is said to amplify any physical, chemical, cognitive, and magical interactions. This means fire burns brighter, muscles move more powerfully, magic is more potent, and minds are made are sharper when exposed to [[The Anger of the Stars]].

Fanatics also claim that when exposed to it, one can hear the voices of a powerful, and ancient being. Little is known to back these claims, but the mythos around it speaks of a being who is obsessed with missions of power, and self preservation. If [[The Anger of the Stars]] is real, it is not thought to be a kind being. Legends of those who are embolden by it are filled with a unique and fiery rage. This phenomena is its namesake.

It would likely be discredited by academics if not for the strange, unexplained phenomena that occurs near The Ghalt Kratur of [[The Witchlands]]. A place where [[The Great Wall of Roots]] was damaged by a very large meteorite long ago, leaving a hole to the cosmos. The strange observations made here are very parallel with the claims of fanatics who believe in [[The Anger of the Stars]]. It is believed by academics of this branch of study, that if this effect is real, it may be a power from outside of [[The Trinity]].
