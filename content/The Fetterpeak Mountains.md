[[The Fetterpeak Mountains]] are the most explored mountains in all of [[The Three Corners]]. This region is located between [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], bookended on either side by [[Archaic]] and , the magical cities of their respective kingdoms [[Deepspell]].

Filled with beautiful sharp peaks, waterfalls, and caves. This region is well know due to its proximity to the academic institutions [[The Kybis Assembly]] and [[Kerketh Academy]]. Being relatively well tamed, bandits and other criminals are know to take refuge here.

One perplexing mystery of the region remains unsolved. There are a few peaks where anyone who ventures to them never returns. The institutions have made these regions forbidden, by punishment of expulsion. However that is rarely exercised as most who go even close to these few peaks are never seen again.

## Location
