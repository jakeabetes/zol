The Word of shadow is the anonymous [[Wordbearer]]. No one knows their true identity, origin, or place of residence. Many doubt their existence, but other [[Wordbearers]] have confirmed their existence.

## Origin
Unknown, but their existence was confirmed by other [[Wordbearers]] after a dangerous cult of Void Worshippers were all killed in a single night within [[Holocene]], [[Hanen]], and [[Ka'thoor]].

## Behavior
[[The Word of Shadow]] is said to be an unseen protector who silences evil that threatens the world of mortals. No one knows where [[The Word of Shadow]] resides, but rumor says [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. This is largely because [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] and [[The Ward]] do not have a known wordbearer who protects the region.

## Cultural Significance 
- Since little is known about [[The Word of Shadow]], many myths and legends exist about this individual.
