# The Awakening
A term used for the recorded explanations by the earliest people who were transported to the Three Corners of Civilization and had their memories taken during [[The Undoing]].

There are no recorded first hand accounts from [[The Awakening]]. As there were no resources for things like writing, but much of its nature was recorded in text that survived [[The Dragon War]].

The main details of [[The Awakening]] are:
- All sapient beings awoke in the Three Corners of Civilization. With no memories of their past lives.
- Those on the eastern most edge witnessed the final moments of the destruction of the old world. Nearly everything within was reduced to dust. What remained is [[The Grand Nothing]].
- The earliest days were spent like primal beings. Living in makeshift shelters and hunting for wild game.
- All beings, regardless of race or background all knew the language of [[Common]].
