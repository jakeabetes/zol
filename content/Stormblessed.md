title: "Stormblessed"
---Individuals who garnered the favor of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] during their trials of [[The Enduring]]. It is not known exactly what specific actions allow for an individual to become [[Stormblessed]], but those who have experienced it claim to have accomplished a feat of courage, strength, will power, wisdom, or something of the sort. Their success gains them an audience with [[Adrathar]] at [[The Storm Horizon]], and they are given a gift of power.

These gifts can manifest in many ways, but most typically they are super human strength, magical affinity, flight, and enhanced senses or cognitive ability. Sometimes an individual may manifest more than one power. [[Stormblessed]] are also known by their distinctive markings. When given their gift, their body is covered in unique patterning that appears almost like a tattoo, and glows vibrantly when they utilize their powers.
