# The Space Outside Reality
*An eldritch myth told by alien monsters called [[Illithids]]. Manifesting as one of the [[Planes]] of existence with laws like no other*

A place of abstraction and eldritch horror. The supposed homeland spoken of by [[Illithids]] who were captured and interrogated.

Sometimes called The Far Realm, [[The Space Outside Reality]] is a theoretical expanse that exists at the end of [[The Cosmos]].

[[Illithids]] captured and interrogated speak of this realm as the original home world to the [[Great Old Ones]] like [[Goh'zul]]. According to its locals, reality is merely a byproduct of the interactions going on in this space.

Little useful information has been gleaned on this subject. From what is known, it is a space where geometry and biology take a back seat. One's own cognition becomes the basis of function and survival.

Filled with strange power and eldritch gods. The beings from here seem to bear a unique hatred for all of reality. Speaking down to mortals as inferior beings, and claiming they have 'no right' to the powers that manifest the universe, especially [[Zol]].

No mortals from [[Zol]] have even come close to discovering a method of venturing to [[The Space Outside Reality]]. Despite this, some academics obsess over the concept and seek the knowledge of [[Illithids]].
