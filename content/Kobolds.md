## Description
[[Kobolds]] are of short stature, scales, and sharp teeth. Known to keep in *packs*, [[Kobolds]] are very communal beings, but typically only with other [[Kobolds]]. Their packs have a very important hierarchical structure that determines a Kobold's place socially.

[[Kobolds]] are a strange race. Often compared to both [[Dragonborn]] and [[Goblins]], but still somehow very unique. The posses draconic traits, however their blood does not bare the characteristic [[Magic]] of [[Dragons]] like [[Dragonborn]] do. They also exhibit similar hierarchical behavior like [[Goblins]].

[[Kobolds]] did not initially face the same prejudice as [[Goblins]]. However this changed during [[The Dragon War]]. Many (but not all) [[Kobolds]] took to serving the dragons who terrorized [[The Three Corners]]. This betrayal of [[The Three Corners]] gave [[Kobolds]] a reputation of being evil, self serving, and unintelligent. However most, if not all, [[Kobolds]] who betrayed [[The Three Corners]] died off in the late stages of [[The Dragon War]]. Those who remain in civilization are the descendants of those who did not turn their backs on society, but they are treated as if they were the betrayers themselves. This has driven many kobolds to the fraying edges of society, or from civilization entirely.

## Additional Info
- [[Kobolds]] face a great deal of prejudice in [[The Ward]] due to their race's history during [[The Dragon War]]
- [[Kobolds]] have a very wide range in their expected lifespan. This is because [[Kobolds]] who live outside of modern society are very wild, and accident prone.
