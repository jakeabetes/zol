---*The Elemental City*
![[Ep Drukar skyline 3.png]]

[[Ep Drukar]] is home to the [[Genasi]]. A race of beings who are born with a unique connection to [[The Elemental Planes]]. Reclusive within their mountain top city, the [[Genasi]] hold the connection of ones self to the world around them as a very sacred thing. This connection is most prevalent in the [[Genasi]]'s relationship with ephemeral beings called [[Sylfs]]. Strange fairy-like creatures who hail from [[The Elemental Planes]].

| Main Opportunity         | The [[Genasi]] of [[Ep Drukar]] posses a symbiotic relationship with [[Sylfs]], a strange cast of beings who hail from [[The Elemental Planes]]. These beings bond with [[Genasi]] giving them their famous elemental characteristics. These bonds define the culture of the city, and make for a unique daily life. | 
| Main Challenge           | Much of [[Genasi]] history and tradition revolves around the protection, maintenance, and reverence of the surrounding territory. The [[Genasi]] call the region *Tsarde'n*, and it stretches from their mountain, Ableom, to the western sea. The [[Genasi]] hid upon these peaks for many generations. They were aware of the existence of outsiders, but knew the bonded no [[Sylfs]]. This fact, and the guidance of the [[Sylfs]] kept [[Ep Drukar]] hidden away from the rest of the world for more than 2000 years. When it was eventually discovered, the following relationships between [[Ep Drukar]] and its neighboring cities were peaceful in nature. However their long standing disconnection has made it difficult for the city and its people to integrate with the outside world. Outsider's who visit [[Ep Drukar]] will find unique culture, vast wisdom, and strange magic. However they will also find stubbornness, a lack of modern technology, and naiveite regarding the outside world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| The Five       | City Elders      | A group of five leaders made up from each type of [[Genasi]]: Water, Fire, Air, and Earth. As well as an unbound [[Genasi]], also called a *Halcyon* [[Genasi]]. This council is charged with guiding their city's decisions, and ensuring daily life is maintained. Each member of the five selects their successor, unless they perish suddenly. In that case the successor is chosen by the remaining four. |
| Water Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Mistings, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of water. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be very well balanced individuals. Putting a lot of effort into personal growth, relationships, hobbies, and work they do.                                                                                                                                       |
| Fire Genasi    | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Cindrins, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Fire. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be extremely passionate individuals. Separating logic and emotion is quite difficult for a Fire [[Genasi]]. They are known as dedicated go-getters, die hard friends, and also to be a bit of a pain in the ass.                                                 |
| Earth Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Stalegs, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Earth. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be very thoughtful, and intelligent individuals. They have a reputation of taking their time with everything they do. They are known for being always considerate, and always late.                                                                              |
| Air Genasi     | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Typhis, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Air. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be wild and care free. Their flippant attitudes can be frustrating at times, but their fun loving ideals, and excitable personalities tend to outweigh their wandering focus.                                                                                    |
| Halcyon Genasi | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who do not bond [[Sylfs]]. There are many opinions of this type of [[Genasi]], but the most prominent one is that they are lesser or simple. This is an unspoken thing, and very frowned upon to say aloud. However many who bind [[Sylfs]] find it difficult to not feel this way. The fact of the matter is they are no more simple than their bound neighbors, they merely did not find a sylf with a compatible personality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Goods and Services

| Temple of Tsarde'n | Keep   | The city's central structure. Home to the Five and the monastic teachings of wisdom and combat within the city.                |
| Lazzul's Tavern    | Tavern | The city's most notable drinking establishment and lodging. A very humble establishment, but a staple by the city's standards. |
| Midern Market      | Market | The city's market square                                                                                                                               |

## Authority
The city is overseen by The Five. A group of elders responsible for the city's well being. They lead the Temple of Tsarde'n and posses a very small, but capable group of fighters. Members of the five give up their old name when taking the mantle of elder, they instead use the name given to the position.

The Five are as follows:
- Hilaen, elder of Water
- Sidoren, elder of Fire
- Yimir, elder of Earth
- Aesudon, elder of Air

The elders maintain a city where everyone is treated as equals, and has their needs met to the best of the cities abelites. However the city's remote nature, and mountain top location does mean that they fall on hard times on occasion.

### Laws
The city does not posses a written set of laws. Disputed matters are decided by The Five. Things like: murder, theft, trespassing, fraud, and things of the like are almost always lead to sever punishment. [[Genasi]] culture simply views these things as so obviously wrong they do not need specific rules, merely the wisdom of elders to deal with.

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Ep Drukar]] is one of the many cities who has an almost mythical reputation. It is extremely remote, and no teleportation circle, or train can take you there. To reach it one must venture very very far.

The city has almost no impact in the grand scheme of The Three Corners. However some [[Genasi]] leave the city on pilgrimages, bringing stories of their strange homeland with them. 

## Historical Importance
Long ago, the city's existence was not even known to outsiders. It was only in the year 2811 that elven scouts discovered it. At the time, [[Gethsemane]] was at war with [[Kapesh]] and did not wish to have an enemy on multiple fronts. Peace treaties were quickly put in place and [[Ep Drukar]] was allowed to continue its way of life uninterrupted.

This neutrality was maintained during the [[Western War]]. [[Ep Drukar]] sits very close to the border of [[The Glassius Reach]] and [[Gethsemane]]. However all the involved cities knew their peaceful ways, and allowed [[Ep Drukar]] to maintain a neutral party in the conflict.

## Other Things of Note
- The surrounding region, called Tsarde'n by the [[Genasi]] is not thought to be a geographical region. Its borders are more fluid, and defined only by the guidance of [[Sylfs]]. It is said that Tsarde'n is where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is the thinnest.
- There are many rumors about an ancient and horrible secret located in the center of the Temple of Tsarde'n, and that the real reason for the [[Genasi]]'s isolation is to protect this secret. It is also thought that this thing is the reason for the easily obtained peace treaties with its neighboring cities. 
- There are no slaves in [[Ep Drukar]]
- Education within the city is typically done through monastic tradition conducted at the Temple of Tsarde'n.
