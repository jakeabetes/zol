title: "The Void"
---*What remains of the [[Sea of Monsters]], one of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

The horror of [[Zol]]. Home to the evil [[Void Gods]]. A world of chaos and darkness. [[The Void]] is the part of the [[Sea of Monsters]] that [[The Watcher]] did not harness. Within it lies threats and abominations unknown even to the [[Gods]].

When viewing [[Zol]] from [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]] is not visible. It is thought to be hidden away by the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].

Despite the [[Gods]] attempts to disjoin The Void from the lives of mortals, The Void is closely related to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It looms in [[Zol]]'s history, and threatens its modern days. Only kept back by the constant efforts of the [[Gods]].

There are many physical entrances between [[The Void]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. They exist at the lowest depths of [[Zol]]. Entrances in the deepest fathoms of the ocean lead directly to [[The Void]], and entrances in [[The Underdark]] lead into The Void's subplane, [[Damnation]].

## Known Properties of The Void
Little is known about [[The Void]]. Many scholars and theologians gather what they can about the strange space in an attempt to protect mortals from it. However some seek its power in a dark pursuit.

The known properties of The Void are:
- Entrance to [[The Void]] is similar to most forms of planar travel, but escaping it is extremely difficult. This is due to the will of [[Gods]].
	- Expeditions have been made there, but few have returned. It is thought a mortals easiest method of returning is through [[Apolyatum]], the highest level of [[Damnation]].
- The [[Void Gods]] largely view this place as the true form of [[Zol]] and seek to demolish all other planes and return them to this state.
	- No hard evidence exists of any hierarchy between [[Void Gods]]
- There are likely more [[Void Gods]] than what are known to mortals.
- [[The Void]] has distinct depths.
	- [[Damnation]] is thought to be the most shallow part of [[The Void]]
	- The deeper one ventures into [[The Void]] the more dangerous and inescapable it becomes.
- Death in the void is unique. Academics are not sure if it exists on [[The Mortal Coil]], but interrogated [[Demons]] revealed that if one dies in [[The Void]], their soul becomes homed to it and they are banished deep within its confines.
	- Effectively if one dies in [[The Void]], they are locked within permanently.

## Damnation
[[Damnation]] is a subplane of [[The Void]] and seems to feed off the unclaimed souls of the [[Prime Material Plane]].

## Demons and Fiends
Residing the the greater Void are many horrible beings called [[Demons]]. They come in great varieties and almost all have destructive intentions.

Within the subplane of [[Damnation]] resides a similar but distinctly different cast of beings called [[Fiends]]. To an uneducated eye they would seem the same as [[Demons]]. However there is a sole difference that divides them.

[[Fiends]] are beings bound by oath to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they are caught by a greater demon betraying him their souls are instantly destroyed. Most [[Fiends]] are endlessly loyal to Aldem because of this.

[[Demons]] however are not bound to serve a master if they do not choose to. This gives [[Demons]] a sense of pride over fiends that has forged a unique hatred between the 2 groups over many ages.

The two groups of monsters clash regularly. Mortals have even been known to gain favors from one group when sparring with the other.
