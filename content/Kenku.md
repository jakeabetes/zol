*Cursed Corvid*
![[Kenku.png]]

## Description
[[Kenku]] are very few in number, and some think they are merely a thing of myth. Every member of their race bears a strange curse which is detectable by [[Divination]]. This curse makes the beings natural wings ineffective for fight, and strangely removes a [[Kenku]]'s ability to form normal speech. However they have adapted a unique method of communication with the ability to perfectly mimic any sound they hear (within reason). This allows them to form speech by quoting sentences and mixing and matching heard words into coherent communication. 

Their odd existence is made all the more strange by the fact that no one knows where they came from. They are dubbed a product [[Speciatum Magica]] by the fact that they all seem to bear a curse which effects their biology. Some think them descendants of early [[Aarakocra]] who tampered with dark forces, but even this is a guess at best.

They appear as corvid-like beings. They bear feathers and raven or crow like features. However they are incapable of flight. They are not often encountered, and when they are they are often mistaken for [[Aarakocra]].
