title: "Viridescence"
---[[Viridescence]] is the second of the wills. It is [[Magic]] that was used to build the physical world of [[Zol]]. It requires a deep understanding of ones place as a living being in the world, and the connections between all things. This power can come from synergy with nature, or domination over it.

Access to this will comes naturally to some, while for others take a great many years to comprehend. The true nature of this will is not understood by scholars, but many [[Druids]] and [[Witches]] claim to comprehend it in a manner that seems more philosophical than practical.

The source itself can be deceiving, for a great many years it was debated that [[Observance]] and [[Viridescence]] were one and the same. This was changed by theologians and scholars who were able to prove that power drawn from nature is not contingent on a bond in the same way as [[Observance]] is.

[[Viridescence]] is the very power that was bound into [[Zol]]. Every stick, stone, and citizen is formed of it. By this mechanism individuals are able reshape the bound power, or drain it and use it for their own gain. Even [[Iron Light]] machines have been developed that can utilize its power.
