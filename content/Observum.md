title: "Observum"
---
[[The University]]'s institution regarding the study of [[Gods]], their power channeled through the will of [[Observance]], and their relationship to [[Zol]]. This organization is the only one of its kind within [[The Three Corners]], as attempting to comprehend the [[Gods]] from an academic perspective is a challenging task.

The school officially does not fall under the sole banner of a single religion. However, people will be people, and their beliefs and biases always find a way to manifest. The [[Observum]] is no stranger to heated debate, crossed lines, and difficult conversations. However it is from these challenging discussions the school derives new philosophy and understanding. It is also know as [[The University]]'s best repository of knowledge regarding [[Zol]]'s history, as much of the [[Gods]]' influences are hidden within the accounts of the world.

Many people think that the [[Observum]] is a beautiful thing, and that the understanding it brings into the world is very important. Others believe that the either the [[Gods]] are not meant to be understood academically and the pursuit of this knowledge is a sin, or they think that it is not possible to understand the [[Gods]], and attempting to do so is a waste of time.

Studying [[Observance]] is also difficult when compared to [[Arcana]], as it requires a great deal of luck to actually be able to tap into the power. Not only does an individual need to have the mindset required to bond with a greater being, but have the favor of a greater being. The latter is not so easily gained. Because of this, most members of the [[Observum]] are non-magical academics.

The schools within the [[Observum]] are:
- [[The Obsidian Temple]]
- [[The First Bastion]]
