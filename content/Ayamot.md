The Golden Dragon of Justice, father of the metallic dragons. Ayamot is the holy judge of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. He has domain over the morality of mortals, and the consequences of their actions.

## Depiction
Depicted as a colossal golden dragon with white filigree. Ayamot emits radiant light and bears a halo. When not in the form of a dragon, Ayamot is known to shapeshift into any form he choses, most commonly this is that of a mortal man. These shape-shifted forms typically bear his halo.

## Symbolism
A hand with a triangular void in its center.

## Behavior
Ayamot is known to dole out blessings and justice to mortals who have committed notable actions. These actions can be good or bad. Unlike the utilitarian methods of his fellow god [[Tellab, the Wise]], Ayamot has a very strong moral compass and enacts judgement based on this compass. This approach may be based in utilitarian morals at times, altruistic at others, or some other philosophical razor.

Those who base their morals by his guidance adopt what is called Ayam Morals.

## Realm
Ayamot resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. He is know to spend much of his time soaring through surrounding sky, or perched on the cliffs where he gazes into the lives of mortals.

## Worshipers
Followers of Ayamot seek guidance in the decisions of their actions based in Ayam Morals. There are many temples and churches built to the honor of Ayamot. Statues of his likeness are commonplace in courthouses all over [[Zol]].

## Father of Metallic Dragons
Ayamot is the progenitor of the Metallic [[Dragons]], and is revered by them as their ruler. Due to this fact, most [[Metallic Dragons]] follow his philosophy and aim to aide mortals.
