title: "Godkiller - Premise"
---The death of [[Giriam]], the Zolaen God of Agriculture and Fertility, has thrown [[Zol]] into an unprecedented era. No one knows exactly what, or who killed this god. Mortals weren’t even told of his death by other gods until the catastrophic effects were seen in everyday life.

Theological panic, famine and wildly differing birth rates grip [[The Three Corners]]. These challenges acted as the seeds for secondary forms of chaos like tension between kingdoms, plague, [[Warforged]] rebellions, and may have even caused many [[Dragons]] to awaken from
their millennia long slumber. 

Our story starts 6 years after [[Giriam]]’s death (which would be 4 years after Professor Abacus Oleander’s [Journal Entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK5vR_A_axI&ab_channel=JacobTurner)), and academics have claimed that birthrates and famine have started to trend towards normalcy. However, the other problems sparked by the god’s death still remain, and seem to be getting worse. 

You, and your adventuring party, will start as a group of new friends/acquaintances trying to make their way through this new era. What happens from there, is up to you. The campaign will begin with this premise: 

*Each and every one of you is heading to the city of [[Tenzentak]], to join up with [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. This is done by way of Guild Tickets, orange train tickets which allows for travel from any city to [[Tenzentak]] along the [[The Iron Tracks]] at the expense of The Guild. When arriving, newcomers can attempt to prove themselves as worthy members. Those who succeed are granted a Slate, a badge which proves Guild membership and opens many doors across [[The Three Corners]].*

**Book 1 - Elsewhere, Chapter 1 - Train to Tenzentak** Will begin during the mid-morning on the *11th of Spring, Annum 4466*, within [[Rails]] Station where the party will all be waiting to board the train.
