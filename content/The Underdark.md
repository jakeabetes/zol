The vast nexus of caves the spans underneath [[Zol]]. No one knows the width and depth to which these caves reach, but it is thought that less than 1% of it has been mapped. It is said to contain cities, oceans, and other colossal anomalies that are all intertwined by complex weaving caves. Academics believe that at its greatest depths it leads over into [[The Void]], and travelling laterally can cause one to enter Temperament of [[The Elemental Planes]]. Many fear [[The Underdark]], and for good reason. There exists an old dwarven saying, that essentially says: *"Fear what lurks below [[Zol]], for not even The [[Gods]] know what resides down there"*.

The most widely known entities that exist in [[The Underdark]] are:
- [[Jerda'll]]
- [[Mod Dranor]]
- The Belowcean of [[The Grand Nothing]]

## History and Inhabitants
Traversal through most of [[The Underdark]] is dangerous, cramped, confusing, and of course *dark*. This makes it an undesirable place for most explorers to venture into. The cities of The Three Corners that reside within are only just below the surface, information about what lies below them is folklore to most people.

However there are some records and rumors about what lurks deep below [[Zol]], and some scholars claiming to have found portals to [[Damnation]] itself.

Some of these pieces of information include:
- A race of sapient fungus based beings called [[Myconids]] that have a small, humble society.
- A race of massive furry monster-like people called the [[Oddians]], each with their own unique shape, size, coat pattern, and horns. While appearing fearsome they are actually quite friendly so the stories say.
- A city of Fire [[Giants]] built within a volcanic pool.
- The ruins of some ancient city below [[The Ward]].
- Massive sleeping beasts the size of whole city districts.
- Entrances to [[Damnation]]
- Stories of entering Temperament of [[The Elemental Planes]]
