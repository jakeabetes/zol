Ka'thoor, the Orcish City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and known for its eclectic citizens, spicy food, dominant population of [[Orcs]] and unique architecture that incorporates the bones of large beasts. Ka'thoor rests on the border of [[Kapesh]], and is nestled into the mountains. It is a common stop for any who leave or enter [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].

Ka'thoor was once a hub of slave trade during the [[First Age]], and was the first of the now free cities to begin the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. In its victory, Ka'thoor has created a proud, but largely welcoming culture. They keep their history in everything they do to remain a beacon to all of [[Zol]].

Ka'thoor is also a hub of trade. This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor.

This environment makes Ka'thoor one of the most unique cities in all of Alderun.
