title: "Abdjadan"
---*The underwater city of Triton*
![[Abdjadan skyline.png]]

For millennia, [[Abdjadan]] sat quiet and hidden beneath the waves of [[The Archsea]]. The surrounding kingdoms were oblivious to its existence. This was only until some curious pirates notices light beneath the waves, and dove down to discover a whole city of Triton. While amazing, no one benefited from this discovery. [[Abdjadan]] took to attacking any outsiders that approached, and the surrounding kingdoms were not happy to learn they had a potential enemy beneath the surface of [[The Archsea]]. 

This tension only lasted about a hundred years, and some curious member of both surface and deep sea society began to try and explore each others worlds again. Eventually some envoys from both worlds were able to cross over, but [[Abdjadan]] decided to keep its distance. Triton who have entered surface society are the descendants of these envoys. What little is known about their society came from these interactions, and the discoveries made by the surface only continued to get more disturbing.

## Overview
| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | Abdjadan is an extremely well order city. Its citizens are devout followers of [[Ohlit]]. There is little problem with disorder and crime isn't a factor in the city's daily life. The city appears as a thoroughly planned out, and completed machine. |
| Main Challenge | The few who have been lucky enough to enter the city claim that the city has a feeling of vacancy. Somethin within it is missing. Society is well ordered, but its people do not have the freedom to explore life beyond the city. This all stems from the well guarded site at the city's center. By the best guess of scholars, [[Abdjadan]] was built at [[Ohlit]]'s will overtop the most shallow fissure to [[The Void]]. Beneath the district of Saraxan lies a sea cave, called The Jaert'n Breach that is fortified by the vast majority of the city's forces. Here, warriors of the city fight of dark creatures who try and climb their way out of [[The Void]] |

| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Those of The Ring | Social Class | The city's royalty, or nobility. These individuals are seen as the most favored by [[Ohlit]]. In their culture this seems to be based on bloodline |
| Commoners         | Social Class | The vast majority. These people are hunters, laborers, soldiers, and crafts persons. They serve their city as best they can to support the efforts to defend                                                                                                                                                   |

| Tide Hall     | Tavern | A tavern popular with the city. Especially those who defend The Breach.                             |

## Authority
The city is ruled by Queen Piton Amashal, a young Triton woman who has recently inherited the throne due to the unfortunate passing of their father, a previous beloved ruler. Queen Amashal is an ambitious but na√Øve ruler, and seeks to open channels of communication with the surface. This has created discourse amongst the city's people. However the first and foremost mandate is still upheld by the city: defend The Jaert'n Breach. This requires that nothing comes through the breach, and no one comes to tamper with it from [[The Prime]]. 

### Laws
The city does not have formal law because of its well ordered people, however the local authority would surely respond to anything most other kingdoms consider a crime.

The city also does not allow outsiders.

## Modern Importance
The city holds little modern importance, but is commonly mentioned in stories and rumor. Particularly those of sailors.

## Historical Importance
The city has little historical importance. The most notable thing about it is how long it kept itself hidden before it was discovered by surface dwellers.

## Other Things of Note
- Some believe that the city holds a great treasure, making it a common place of interest for pirates. There is of course, no hard evidence of this fact.
- The city does use currency, but exclusively gold coin. The conversion rates here are also not in favor of surface dwellers. A simple meal would cost 15 gold coins.
