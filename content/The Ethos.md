# The Ethos
*The space in-between the [[Planes]] of Zol*

The Ethos, a vast expanse that cradles all of [[Zol]]. Only the few who posses great magical power have ever explored it.

Also called [[The Astral Sea]]. At its borders lie [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Beyond that, [[The Cosmos]].

Within [[The Ethos]], planets appear as solid spherical masses and realms appear as gaseous clouds intermingled with tendrils of floating matter.

At its edge, [[Zol]] is bound by [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. A massive nexus of nigh indestructible wood like matter that keeps [[Zol]] separate from the rest of [[The Cosmos]].

There are no effects of gravity in [[The Ethos]] unless very near to a planet. Moment amongst [[The Ethos]] is done by willing one's self in a direction manually. Transportation [[Apparatum]] have also been manufactured in recent times manifesting as airships or personal flight devices.
