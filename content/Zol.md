*Welcome to the world of [[Zol]]*

## Steps for Zol's Creation
- ~~Initial Skeleton of Site~~
- ~~Introduction, Origin, and Homepage~~
- ~~Magic system~~
- Gods
- ~~Planes~~
- ~~Historical Timeline~~
- Regions 
- Lore to fill gaps (characters, objects, events, and other specific concepts of note)

*This is the checklist that I am following. Once all items are ticked off, Zol will be ready for usage. Note that just because a section is ticked off it does not mean it is 100% complete. All sections will have their final touch ups done in the last 2 steps*

## Lorelhiem
A Distant and strange feudal land rumored to be far west of The Three Corners of Civilization, beyond the reaches of nautical technology and teleportation magic. A strange ever present fog in the vast sea prevents any magical observation of this place.

(Note: This is the first planned future expansion of [[Zol]])
