# An Introduction to Zol
This is a brief video I made that explains the high level concepts of the world. It gives a good foundation for anyone who is looking to use [[Zol]] for any purpose.

## Special Thanks
This project took quite a long time for me to build, and it wouldn't have been possible without the help, and inspiration from a lot of people in my life. To credit these people, I have written a page of [[Thanks]].

## Campaigns
The main purpose of this site is to act as reference material for my TTRPG campaigns. I also use this site for storing relevant information for my ongoing [[Campaigns]].

## Other Projects
I have also created a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Homebrew ruleset which is meant to act as a compliment to this project. Check out [Turner's Guide to Turns](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Xao0zcbypZQV) to learn more.
