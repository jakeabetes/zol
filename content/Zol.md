**Welcome to the world of [[Zol]]**

*For easy map navigation, please see the [Interactive Map](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/177268/maps/52803/explore) (Currently a work in progress)*

## Steps for Zol's Creation
- Initial Skeleton of Site (100%)
- Introduction, Origin, and Homepage (100%)
- Magic system (100%)
- Planes (100%)
- Historical Timeline (100%)
- Regions (100%)
- Gods (90%)
- Cities (70%)
- Interactive Map (5%)
- Lore to fill gaps (characters, objects, events, and other specific concepts of note) (0%)
- Final Cleanup (0%)

*This is the task list that I am following. Once all items are at 100%, Zol will be ready for usage. Note that a section at 100% complete is still subject to change, and will still require final cleanup. All sections will have their final touch ups done in the last 2 steps*
