title: "Off-Human"
---The concept of '[[Off-Human]]' is a portion of the [[Great Magic]] belief. It was spawned due to the publication of [[The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from The Grand Nothing]], and long standing cultural divides from the early [[First Age]]. It is rooted in the belief that [[Humans]] caused [[The Undoing]], and the [[Zolaen Gods]] punished the by taking away their [[Great Magic]]. The power held within the magic was set free, and became the [[Off-Human]] races. Each one of the [[Races]] is said to exhibit a fragment of the human's nature: 

| Off-Human Race | Trait |
| --- | --- |
| [[Gnomes]] | Ingenuity |
| [[Halflings]] | Appetence |
| [[Orcs]] | Fury |
| [[Tieflings]] | Devilishness |
| [[Aarakocra]] | Hospitality |
| [[Goblins]] | Depravity |
| [[Goliaths]] | Strength |
| [[Dragonborn]] | Greed |
| [[Harengons]] | Alacrity |
| [[Kobolds]] | Subservience |
| [[Tabaxi]] | Thievishness |
| [[Tritons]] | Temperance |
| [[Genasi]] | Primordial |
| [[Changelings]] | Deception |
| [[Firbolgs]] | Informality |
| [[Owlin]] | Wisdom |
| [[Grung]] | Pride |

This is an extremely controversial concept, and drives much of the social, political, cultural, and religious divide that exist in [[The Three Corners]]. It is based largely on speculation, and bias. Especially the specific traits that have been ascribed to each of the [[Off-Human]] races. Many resist the concept, however it is so widely known and has been deeply engrained into the culture of [[The Three Corners]] for so long, that it is very hard to escape.
