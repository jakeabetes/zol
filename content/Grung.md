## Description
[[Grung]] are known to be very proud creatures. They do not like to associate with other [[Races]] as they typically think themselves superior. Within society, [[Grung]] are known to keep in small communities of other [[Grung]] and rarely associate outside of these groups except when conducting business.

They are frog-like beings. Born a simple greyish color, each of them takes on a unique color and pattern as they reach adulthood. This pattern seems to be based upon diet. [[Grung]] also secret a substance that is poisonous to other creatures. In small doses the poison is merely a strong numbing agent, but when exposed in large amounts the substance acts as a potent neurotoxin. However beings can typically gain immunity to it when exposed over a long period of time.
