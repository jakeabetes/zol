title: "Vizir"
---Vizir is a fragment of [[The Trinity]] held within all beings in [[Zol]]. When harnessed, it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way, granting [[Magic]] power. It is largely thought to be the very essence of ones soul, and can be trained like a muscle.

Utilizing one's Vizir is no simple task and can be very exhausting. It is typically accomplished in one of three ways for each of [[The Wills]] respectively.
- **Faith**, for [[Observance]]. It requires that one believes in the power of their source, and that they themselves are a worthy candidate for it. Any shred of doubt weakens the channeled power significantly. The closer the bond between [[Caster]] and source, the stronger the [[Magic]]. This belief opens them up so the power of their source can pass through them, and be transformed by their will.
- **Understanding**, for [[Viridescence]]. It requires one to mentally blur the line between self and nature, and allow for their will to bleed into the surroundings. This allows one to work with nature, or bend it to their will.
- **Conceptualization**, for [[Arcana]]. The most abstract of the craft. Requiring a user to have a full image of the reality they are trying to create in their mind. It can be done in an infinite amount of ways, but is typically thought of in terms of [[Arcanists]]. 
	- Take the example of an arcanist using a [[Spell]]. It requires one to visualize [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. These visualizations differ greatly from practice to practice, and even [[Caster]] to caster. These bonds can be relatively simple or immensely complex. For instance, the [[Spell]] Mage Hand (when taught academically) is performed by an arcanist who is visualizing a space near them to be directly connected to their hand, or the part of the mind that controls their hands. Even though the bond is non-existent, they must fully convince themselves of it mentally. On top of that they must utilize another part of their mind to draw [[Energy]] from [[The Trinity]] to make the hand move and manipulate objects. This is called [[Splitting]]. Splitting is extremely difficult and gets very complex very quickly. Skilled [[Arcanists]] can split their mind dozens of times for complex spells, convincing themselves of non-existent realities that sometimes even contradict one another.

## Other Methods
Alternatively to that, other individuals have been known to use entirely unique methods to access any of the three wills. Like use of artistry to conceptualize the effect of a [[Spell]]. Some warriors will use their own blood to infuse their weapons with their [[Vizir]]. Others may not even view what they are doing as magic. Warrior monks will use great focus, breathing, and movement techniques to empower their physical body with Vizir, or [[Ki]] as they call it. Some are known to even surge with [[Magic]] in the heat of battle, charged by rage or determination.

This has lead to intense debate amongst scholars and theologians. Many believe they have the true understanding to the shape of [[Magic]] and [[The Trinity]], but others argue only a sliver of information is known about the true nature of [[Magic]] and [[Zol]] itself.

Another practice of [[Vizir]] is the utilization of [[Iron Light]]. [[Iron Light]], which involves inscribing runes on plates of iron, which allow a user to lend their [[Vizir]] to produce wonderous effects. The difference between [[Iron Light]] and all other aspects of [[Vizir]], is utilization of an object created with [[Iron Light]] requires no magical knowledge to produce a magical effect.

## Connection to The Old Tongue
Great practice with one's [[Vizir]] is thought to lead to discovery of [[The Old Tongue]]. This leads to theories by some scholars that [[The Old Tongue]] binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] temporarily. Which largely increases magical power, and makes accessing it less exhausting.

## Vizir 'Burning'
A rare phenomenon observed most commonly amongst mages in battle. This phenomenon is described as a hyper focused state where one accesses their internal power with little to no difficulty compared to their normal experience with the practice. It was thought originally to be related to [[The Old Tongue]], but most scholars agree the two are unrelated.

When one 'burns' their [[Vizir]] they go into a sort of trance, and experience the sensation of extreme heat within their chest. Metal within the vicinity is pushed back upon like a repelled magnet. The effect is most prominent with silver and iron. Individuals near a 'burner' can actually feel the repelling sensation, this is likely because of the trace amounts of metal within most people bodies. Beyond that, those within the vicinity of a 'burner' feel cold radiating from them. The repelling force emitted from this individual varies in strength. Some accounts record it as strong enough to push a metal cup across a table, other accounts claim 'burners' have thrown full grown men in plate many feet.

While most commonly observed amongst mages, there have been record of warriors, unpracticed in magic, emitting the same repelling force in battle.

## Vizir and Lifespan
It is not known why, but a stronger [[Vizir]] tends to extend ones lifespan naturally. This seems to vary on a case by case basis. Some powerful individuals have been known to live almost 3 to 5 times as long as expected.
