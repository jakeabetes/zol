*The City of Echoing Caves*
![[Jerdall groundline 2.png]]

Deep below the forest glades of [[Gethsemane]] lies the tall  cavern city of [[Jerda'll]]. Home to the [[Drow]], the city is a place of unique culture and unusual beauty. Its people hold traditions of deep legends and shared songs. Protected from outside influences by its giant iron gate, [[Jerda'll]] is truly a sight and sound to behold. Its people are known to sing and play old songs called [[The Acrylons]]. These pieces of music are said to aid them in their daily pursuits, share emotion, honor their dead, and protect their oldest stories from the withering effects of time.

[[The Acrylons]] can almost always be heard within the city in some capacity. Blacksmiths singing songs of metal work, pedestrians humming tunes that denote their mood or journey's purpose, city guard chanting low simple songs of order. All of these songs meld and harmonize together when performed in proximity, as if they were part of some greater, singular composition. These melodies are taught to children parallel with things like language, and etiquette. [[The Acrylons]] give a sense of community, synchronicity, and connectedness to all people of the city. Their echoing through the caves fills the city with a sense of heartfelt warmth on good days, and a haunted feeling on darker ones.  It is said that a [[Drow]] far from home can touch a raw stone and hear the songs of their people.

| Main Opportunity         | Citizens of [[Jerda'll]] posses [[The Acrylons]], a unique form of musical communication that creates an interconnected society amongst the [[Drow]]. The city's people can react and respond to the song they hear around them. An uneducated eye may think the city moves like a machine, where each person fits into a functional box and their songs mesh together like the teeth of gears. The truth is more like the innerworkings of nature. There is an everchanging flow to the city, but you can see its truths if you know how to listen for it. Those who can comprehend it, can glean much from the city by ear alone. |
| Main Challenge           | Residing underground can be an isolating way of life. However this is favorable to many [[Drow]]. So favored in fact, they keep their gates barred shut for to all outside parties. Guests are only allowed on official business, formal invitation, or the rare event. Outsiders are easy to spot in the city as they bear no songs. Most feel very out of place in the city.                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Modern Importance
The city of [[Jerda'll]] is quite isolated from the world due to its location and its social practices. To outsiders, it lives mostly in rumors and myths of the common folk, but more worldly individuals are still relatively unaware of the city's daily life.

It does however, act as one of [[The Three Corners]]' primary access point to [[The Underdark]], but it is almost exclusively used by the kingdom of [[Gethsemane]].

## Historical Importance
Historically, the armies of [[Jerda'll]] have been a fearsome and intimidating force. Those who have gone to war with [[Gethsemane]] would typically face extended ranged battles. However if [[Gethsemane]] got the upper hand, and could get a dispatchment of foot soldiers beyond enemy reinforcements, those who saw the black armor of [[Jerda'll]] knew they stood on death's door.

The [[Elves]] of [[Jerda'll]] are trained to fight in little to no light, and in very narrow close quarters. This training proves very useful when invading a city. Fighting atop walls and in city alleyways is actually very akin to fighting in a cave. 

## Other Things of Note
- The people of [[Jerda'll]] tell stories of beings who live deep within [[The Underdark]]. Some speak of a hidden city of great beast-like people, covered in brightly colored, and vibrantly patterned fur. Each and every one of them a unique shape and size. There are similar stories of insectoid cities, or nomadic tribes of fungal beings.
