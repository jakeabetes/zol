![[Valmore.png]]

The Guardian of [[Kapesh]], and patriarch of the [[Church of Three Fires]]. Valmore possesses a mastery of The Trinity's Fire.

## Origin
The first [[Wordbearer]] to snap after [[The Awakening]]. His snapping occurred during a massive fire caused by a red dragon attack at the Cathedral of [[The Trinity]] in [[Stigmata]]. At the time, Valmore was a well known warrior of the [[Galliard Crown]]. He rushed into the building to save those trapped inside. Accounts of the event say that the fire which burned that day was hot enough to melt stone. The building collapsed, and caved into its foundation. The rubble smoldered for three days before anything could be recovered from it. When excavation began, they found the body of an ancient red dragon, and Valmore who's still breathing body burned with the fire of a [[Wordbearer]]. No one but Valmore knows what happened in the foundation of that church.

## Behavior
Valmore is known to spend most of his time within the [[Church of Three Fires]]. When needed he defends [[Kapesh]] from great threats such as Wyrms (Very ancient [[Dragons]]) and things of the like.

His power manifests as a fire of three parts. Flames of orange, blue, and white.

## Cultural Significance 
- Valmore is seen as the messiah of the [[Church of Three Fires]], and many consider him to be the most powerful [[Wordbearer]].
- [[Daetro]] has often expressed his dislike for [[The Word of Fire]]
