title: "The Anti-Trinity"
---A power often referred to in Trinity-Centric and Zolaen Centric [[Religion]]s. This power is not recognized by academics, but many believe in its existence. It is thought to be the evil antithesis of [[The Trinity]], and provide dark power to the evil beings of [[The Void]]. Sometimes, [[The Shroud of the Void]] and [[The Anti-Trinity]] are referred to as one and the same.

Academics have found no evidence of this, but some occultists who have worshiped [[The Anti-Trinity]] were discovered to have tapped into some dark power. This may be the result of some deception, or there may truly be something out there that academia does not posses the tools required to understand it.
