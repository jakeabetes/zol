title: "Rift Iron"
---A rare metal only found in the rifts near [[Tenzentak]]. It appears in veins similar to normal iron, however after it is mined, it grows back slowly. However this regrows produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]].

When the iron is refined, forged, and tempered, it posses a unique ability to self repair any damage done to it. A hole in armor reforms in a few days, a wheel on a cart is round again in a week, and a shattered sword can be pieced back together with care. This makes for a very desirable material. It was harvested extensively during the [[First Age]]. Its veins would slowly restore themselves, but be quickly remined. This made for little of the resource in the ground, but a slow drip of profit from what was found.

When [[Iron Light]] was discovered, the value of [[Rift Iron]] skyrocketed. However, its slow regrowth made it difficult to get. On top of that, once [[Rift Iron]] is tempered, you cannot change its shape, making any material already used useless for [[Artificers]].
