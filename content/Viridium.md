title: "Viridium"

[[The University]]'s institution of nature and its power. The [[Viridium]] studies the will of [[Viridescence]] from an academic perspective. Not only does it seek to understand the wonder and majesty of nature. It also researches [[Antidescence]], the controversial art of stealing power from nature. Utilizing [[Viridescence]] is not something that everyone can do. It requires a unique mindset, and a great deal of patience. Due to this fact, only about half of the people within the [[Viridium]] can actually use the will. This makes studying it a difficult thing.

The other half of the [[Viridium]] do not grovel over this fact. Many of them seek to understand nature to one day be able to use its power. Others focus much on the craft of medicine. The number of people within [[Zol]] who can heal using [[Magic]] are far too low for the number of people who need treatment, so research into the nature as medicine, and the physical body of [[Zol]]'s many races is a very valuable thing.

The sole location of study within the [[Viridium]] is:
- [[The Conservatory]]
