title: "Flaunt"
---Flaunt is a sport played only within [[Reach Run]]. It involves 2 teams of 10 trying to knock each other off of rafts suspended high above water. It is played by children and professionals alike.

## Rules
In Flaunt, 2 teams of 8 are pitted against one another. Each team has a raft held 100 feet above water that is 2 feet by 25 feet, called a **Rung**. Each team has 5 **Beams**, and 3 **Catchers**. **Beams** are not allowed to fly, and stand in a row upon their raft, each armed with 2 sandbags wrapped in a buoyant material called **Bells**. Their goal is to knock their opponents off their raft suspended 20 feet away from their own by throwing their **Bells**.

The **Catcher** comes in if a **Bell** misses its target, or a **Beam** is knocked off. **Catchers** are armed with a **Crosse**, a long stick with a wicker scoop that can be used to throw a **Bell** far and accurately. **Catchers** use their **Crosse** to return missed **Bells** to their team for reuse. Their team is rewarded by their speed. However **Catchers** are not allowed to strike **Beams** with returned **Bells**. **Catchers** are allowed to catch their team's falling **Beams** and return them to their **Rung** given the falling **Beam** never touched the water.

If a **Rung** has no **Beams** upon it, that team loses.
