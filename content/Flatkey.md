title: "Flatkey"
---
A flat key is a medallion given to the workers of [[Heliodor]] who reside in the city of [[Elysium Station]]. This allows them passage to and from the city every day. Its name comes from its vaguely key shaped appearance. Originally they were called "Worker's Badges", but that name didn't stick for long.
