The Culmination of Darkness, The Consumer, The Great Deceiver, [[The Anti-Trinity]]. A being of many names and many mysteries.

[[The Shroud of the Void]] is a god who's existence is not fully understood. Some even believe that he does not truly exist at all, and the theories and mythos around him is merely a tool used by mortals to give name to something they do not understand.

[[The Shroud of the Void]] is the omnipotent shadow figure who lurks in the darkest depths of [[Zol]]. The unseen hand who sews all destruction and chaos that occurs in [[Zol]], and the master of all [[Fiends]].

## Depiction
[[The Shroud of the Void]] is usually depicted as a cloaked figure, who's robes are formed of writhing dark tentacles that span out into a sea of formless horror.

## Symbolism
The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for [[The Void]].

## Behavior
While many stories talk of him with surety, academics would tell you that there is no concrete proof that [[The Shroud of the Void]] exists as the single entity many believe. Rather that he may be the explanation given to the vast amount of information that is not understood about [[The Void]].

That being said, the theories around this being talk of him as the first individual to rise up from the [[Sea of Monsters]] in defiance of the creation of [[Zol]].

He is thought to orchestrate the dark and hateful beings that did not join [[The Watcher]] in the creation of [[Zol]]. He seeks to dismantle all of creation, and return it to his feasting ground.

Capable of unimaginable horrors, those who claim to have witnessed this being succumb to complete insanity. Claiming that the incomprehensible eldritch horror that is [[The Shroud of the Void]] steals the minds of any who dare gaze upon him, and fills that void with his presence.

## Worshipers
Cults and dark arcanists seek his boons in dark rituals. Many temples to his honor are constructed in secret all across [[Zol]].
