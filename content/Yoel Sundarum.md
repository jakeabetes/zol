title: "Yoel Sundarum"
---*The Secluded Iceberg City*
![[Yoel Sundarum 2.png]]

It is not known how long [[Yoel Sundarum]] has been around for, and many outsiders think it to be a myth. What little records were kept about it have been destroyed in the many civil battles that have occurred over the city's history. Some think it to be a few thousand years old, some think it is as old as [[The Awakening]], and then there are those who believe it predates [[The Undoing]] itself. No one understand the magical forces that keep city's ice unmoving and unchanging, or how it knows to dip beneath the surface during [[Greatwinds]], capable of trapping pockets of air in its major buildings to provide for its non-aquatic citizens.

It is a strange place of two rival worlds: the surface district of Shimmer, and its subaquatic counterpart, Cowl. While interconnected, these two sides of the city are very different. They are attached by deep pools located throughout the city that bore the whole way through the iceberg, bridging the two sides. In this odd civilization [[Triton]], [[Beastfolk]], [[Aarakocra]], and a cast of other various races live unharmoniously in its self-contained ecosystem.

## Shimmer
![[yoel_sundarum_-_shimmer.png]]

Shimmer is the city of Sun-Walkers, or as their underwater nieghbors like to call them: *Fe'tiir*. Which is the [[Triton]] word for 'those who can drown'. In the city's culture success is the only measure. Peoples judge each other on how well they perform in their chosen career or pursuit. How much money does a merchant make? How skilled is an artist? How well sculpted is ones furniture? How many people like their cooking? The list goes on and on. We see similar thought patterns in all cultures, but in Shimmer it is ten-fold. If one can prove themselves skilled, they will be invited to greater festivities, and given more opportunity. Its buildings are made of ice and stone, with the occasional timber accent.

## Cowl
![[yoel_sundarum_-_cowl.png]]

The under city of Cowl, known for its wild streets (although the district has no roads), and rowdy populace. Within Cowl, only the strong make their way. Those who live below the surface of [[The North Sea]], known as *Fathomers*, idealize strength and power. If you do not prove yourself as capable and strong, you may be looked down upon. Its buildings are formed entirely of ice, and most are filled with water. However a good deal of buildings are air-filled as they are used for things like drinking, cooking, or the usage of fine tools or fire that water would interfere with.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |

| Main Opportunity | The city is a unique place in [[Zol]], here one can find wisdom, knowledge, craftsmanship, food, and experiences like nowhere else within [[The Three Corners]]. It is a place of stories that seems so obscure many think it only exists in rumor. |
| Main Challenge | The city is disconnected from the outside world, and it always has been. It has been living within a bubble and is completely unconcerned with what goes on outside.

| Citizens of Shimmer | Local group | Also known as Sun-Walkers or Fe'tiir, these individuals reside on the surface of [[Yoel Sundarum]]. They are a competitive bunch with one another and are known to idealize success. The economy of [[Yoel Sundarum]] does incorporate coin, but it is more focused on the general idea of bartering. This makes the idea of basing nobility on finance a moot point. So the people of Shimmer look at how well once succeeds in their career, or other pursuit. This informally determined status places one in the society of the upper city. |
| Fathomers           | Local group | Those who reside in the underwater district of Cowl. Famed for their rowdy behavior, the people of Cowl idealize strength and capability. Those who are powerful, or favored by a powerful person are seen as the higher members of society. This power can be physical strength, or something more complicated like magical ability, or authority over a group of mercenaries.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Half Lunged         | Local group | Individuals who posses the means to both live in water and in air for extended periods of time. This may be some racial trait or some magical enhancement on the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Authority
Within the city there is little formal law, but there is ruling power. Over the history of the city, the format of this rulership has gone through many forms. This is typically caused by some violent upheaval of the city, which someone uses to claim power. Sometimes Cowl and Shimmer have their own rulers and operate as different cities, sometimes there is a council of rulers, and sometimes (like the current ruler) there is a sole authority which both cities respect.

The current ruler is King Mandreg (a mononym), who is a Beastfolk man with a physiology similar to that of a walrus.  He originated from Shimmer, but was a powerful warrior in his youth. He was the leader for an unnamed band of mercenaries which he used to gain power during a period of unrest. His success as a leader gained him the respect of Shimmer, and his strength gave him the respect of Cowl. He has ruled over both cities for many years.

### Laws
The city does not have formal laws, but there is an understanding of what can, and cannot be done. When crossing these lines in a public way, those with some form of authority usually bring the hammer down. 

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Yoel Sundarum]] is thought to be a place from stories. One third of the common folk believe it to be legend, one third argues for its existence, and the final third have never even heard of it. However it truly does exist. Its mechanisms of infrastructure maintained by the iceberg, and its strange socioeconomic climate baffle and intrigue travelling scholars who manage to find it floating out in [[The North Sea]].

The city is not hostile to outsiders, but one would not say they are friendly either. When arriving in [[Yoel Sundarum]], the locals will quickly size you up and determine how to treat you based on your actions.

## Historical Importance
The city has no historical importance in the grand scheme of things. However in its own history, it is a place of unknown origin, that has faced many powershifts. It likely holds many secrets, but it is hard to parse them out from the already baffling city.

## Other Things of Note
- Most liquor within the city is comes from fermented seaweeds
- Subaqueous Hand Signs are a wide cast of gestures used for non-verbal communication underwater. These hand signs are unique to [[Yoel Sundarum]].
- Buildings in Cowl that are air-filled use a complex system of pipes, and cracks in the ice to ensure air can reach these structures.
