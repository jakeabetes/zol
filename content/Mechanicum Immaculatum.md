# Mechanicum Immaculatum
*Pushing the bounds of what it means to be alive*

[[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is a phenomenon that is responsible for the creation of [[Warforged]]. It was discovered in the early 4th millennium.

It is the process of creating an [[Apparatum]] so complex, a soul bonds to it via [[The Mortal Coil]]. Originally discovered by accident when [[Artificers]] were attempting to develop a pen that could act as a scribe for someone who was dictating to it. When the pen began writing of its own volition a massive surge of innovation began. The pen is now known as Professor Scribe and can still be found within [[The University]]'s artificary.

A subservient race of beings called [[Warforged]] were developed to originally fight in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. Soon after slaves began to be replaced by the much more efficient mechanical counterpart. The name [[Warforged]] stuck even though they were longer just used for battle.

No one knows exactly how [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] works. The phenomenon poses an unending list of academic and philosophical questions [[Zol]] has yet to answer.
