*Pushing the bounds of what it means to be alive, [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is the Human translation of Mechanical Conception*

[[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is a phenomenon that is responsible for the creation of [[Warforged]]. It was discovered in the early 4th millennium.

It is the process of creating an [[Apparatum]] so complex, a soul bonds to it via [[The Mortal Coil]]. Originally discovered by accident when [[Artificers]] were attempting to develop a [[Low Automata]] pen that could act as a scribe for someone who was dictating to it. When the pen began writing of its own volition, a massive surge of innovation began. The pen is now known as "Professor Quill" and can still be found within [[The University]]'s artificery.

A subservient race of beings called [[Warforged]] were developed to originally fight in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. This accelerated the conflict from both sides significantly. The destruction that could be committed by forces of soldiers that did not need sleep not sustenance was immense. The mass production of combat ready [[Warforged]] was stopped when some of them began to be damaged in specific ways that gave them free will.

These [[Warforged]] would then go on to damage other [[Warforged]], causing a chain reaction. Drastic measures had to be taken to destroy the rouge constructs, and it became known that using [[Warforged]] in large numbers was not strategically viable.

Soon after slaves began to be replaced by the much more efficient mechanical counterpart. The name [[Warforged]] stuck even though they were longer just used for battle.

No one knows exactly how [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] works. The phenomenon poses an unending list of academic and philosophical questions [[Zol]] has yet to answer.

## Limitations to Mechanicum Immaculatum
[[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is a strange, and complex phenomena that is hard to measure. Nine times out of ten a being who experiences [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] dies within seconds of coming to life. It is not known why this is, but it makes creating [[Warforged]] a major challenge and a huge time investment.

Sapient beings created through [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] can be made with physical or magical abilities, however there seems to be diminishing returns with the powers invested into them during their creation. It is very difficult to create a [[Warforged]] that is as powerful as a master of martial arts, or a well trained arcanist. However their power can increase after they gain a soul in the same way other living creatures can.

Strangely, [[Apparatum]] created by [[Warforged]] cannot undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]. This means [[Warforged]] cannot reproduce on their own. It is not known why this is.

## Low Automata
It is common for individuals to get confused between [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] giving life to [[Warforged]], and the complex manufacturing of [[Low Automata]]. Low Automata are simplistic beings crafted through [[Magic]] that exist similarly to [[Warforged]]. However [[Low Automata]] do not have a true soul bound to them, and therefore do not undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]].
