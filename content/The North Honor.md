title: "The North Honor"
---
A pact formed between the cities of [[The Ward]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Its purpose was to unite the people against their greater foe, the [[Dragons]]. It lasted many generations, and in the end [[The Ward]] won out against their enemy.

The pact was held for many years after, until [[Hoss]] broke it. They tried to take the other cities: [[Often]] and [[Fike]]. However these two cities kept their promises, and continue fighting against [[Hoss]] to this day under the banner of [[The North Honor]]
