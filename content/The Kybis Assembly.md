title: "The Kybis Assembly"
---The first place of knowledge within [[The Three Corners]]. [[The Kybis Assembly]] is a place of great knowledge, and strange secrets. It is a very secretive institution, and very difficult to gain admission to. Located within [[Archaic]], the school is so old that it holds many of the records from directly after [[The Awakening]], as it was the first true school that was established.

## Values
*"We speak not the language in which truth is written."*

[[The Kybis Assembly]] has always sought the secrets of [[Zol]]. It has a long history of trying to crack the secrets of things like [[The Old Tongue]], [[Beast Ire]], and the world lost within [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many stories and rumors of the dark things that go on within [[The Kybis Assembly]] paint a grim picture of it. However the school produces some of the sharpest minds, and the most powerful mages.

## Origin
The school was originally founded within the city of [[Archaic]] for the purpose of recompiling the knowledge lost in [[The Undoing]]. It was the first academic institution, and its creation sparked a revolution in [[Zol]].

## Structure
The School is not the largest of its kind, but it is known to be one of the most powerful. Their methods of education are dangerous, mysterious, and effective.
- ### Leadership
	- The schools day to day is handled by Insightors, but it is said the true mission of [[The Kybis Assembly]] is decided by The Grand Insightors, if they even exist.
- ### Size
	- The school is around three to four thousand members, however not all of them are on the schools grounds at one time.
- ### Rules
	- The school is extremely strict, and it of the greatest importance that its members do not share its secrets with outsiders
- ### Admission
	- Getting into the school is extremely difficult. One must send a letter of their own creation, paired with a letter of recommendation. Then they must wait for a communication from the school. Those with promise are invited back to the school for a thorough test. Some tell tales of their test being a normal, verbal examination. While others tell strange stories of being asked to solve unique puzzles, or philosophical questions. If they pass, they may enter the school as long as they can afford the expensive tuition.
- ### Symbolism
	- The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for [[Arcana]]. No one knows how this symbol was known by the school for so long before the discovery of [[Iron Light]].

## Academic Stations

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Students | Those at the lowest level of education within the Assembly. These students gain entry to the school via very high tuition costs and recommendation letters, or by direct invitation from an Insightor or reputable Preceptor. There is a comradery amongst students but it is usually overshadowed by the competition between peers. Elevated students are given tattoos to mark their status. These markings have secret meanings, but the more markings the higher the station. |
| Preceptors | The second highest level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are researchers given resources by the academy, and act as the professors of the more entry-level classes. This rank is typically granted when a student has learned a few words of [[The Old Tongue]]. |
| Insightors | The masters level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are charged with overseeing the daily ins and outs of the Assembly as well as the education of the student body. Acting as the professors for the more high ranking courses these individuals typically know many words of [[The Old Tongue]]. |
| Grand Insightors | The grand master level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are surrounded by legend and mystery. Some people (even some students) think they do not exist. They are of the most skilled mages within [[Zol]], and their sole responsibility is to seek the deep and eldritch knowledge hidden within the world. It is said these individuals do not even associate with anyone below the rank of Insightor. |
