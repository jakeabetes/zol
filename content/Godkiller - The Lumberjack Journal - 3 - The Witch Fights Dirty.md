Today was another day spent watching Valmore torture the minds of innocents, burning them slowly to death for scraps of information. I miss the days when I was numb to these sorts of things. It’s so difficult for me to find the strength just to pretend to be invested in this war. Let alone the strength to participate. My brother and those he has twisted into acting on his behalf can sense my detachment from their cause. I don’t know what I would say if I were to be called out on it.

As terrible as Valmore’s methods are, we have gotten quite close to discovering the whereabouts of Morana. She may be the first real threat to my brother that has come from the modern people. Aside from Draedon, that is. The Witch fights dirty, but I suppose that is the only way to beat someone like us. 

I hope we never find her.
