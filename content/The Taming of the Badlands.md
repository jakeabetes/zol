# The Taming of the Badlands
Western [[Zol]] was originally populated with the most diverse set of beings in [[The Awakening]]. The myriad of people and chaos made for a wild expanse with little to no governing forces. The region was dubbed The Badlands, and few civilized people ventured there.

Eventually some groups gained enough power to establish themselves as coherent organizations. As more and more of these groups formed, The Badlands became a feudal battleground. Small cities rose and fell constantly, dotting the area with ruins.

Some groups rose high enough to gain legitimacy. It was at this point it became politically advantageous for the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] to support certain parties. They lent aid to the kingdoms of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] who would go on to conquer and found [[Eucaren]].

[[Eucaren]] was originally considered to be part of [[Gethsemane]]. This development caused the rest of The Badlands to organize in response. The diverse kingdoms of [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]] were founded soon after.

These regions fought one another for quite some time. It was clear that [[Eucaren]] was much better off with the aid of [[Gethsemane]]. [[Saen]] had little in terms of resources due to their desert environment, so the made an alliance with [[Arcadia]]. This alliance gave the two regions enough capacity to take [[Eucaren]] from [[Gethsemane]].

There was a long time of disagreement, but a halfling politician and scholar named Perrial Galanor spent much time writing and speaking to the populations of the three kingdoms. She unified them under their shared history of The Badlands, and sought for separation from the [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] due to the their treatment of [[Off-Human]] peoples. The kingdom was named [[Laenwalde]], the gnomish word for perseverance.
