![[The Blades.png]]

A haunting range of sharp peaked mountains, slanted steeply with their peaks pointed at the north east. This mountain range is a culmination of the strange places it borders upon. Surrounded on each side by [[Holyfield]], The Wrath Wastes of [[Gethsemane]], and The Lifewell of [[The Glassius Reach]].

Populated by strange alien creatures of The Lifewell, and the haunting angelic creatures that exist at the outer edges of [[Holyfield]]. These mountains are relatively unexplored, and even more so now due to the fear of crossing [[The Wrath Wastes]].

## Location
These mountains touch the borders of:
- [[Holyfield]]
- [[The Glassius Reach]]
- [[Gethsemane]] via [[The Wrath Wastes]]
