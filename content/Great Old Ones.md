title: "Great Old Ones"
---A Great Old one is a mythical, and unique progenitor being of the cosmos. Discovered via interrogation of [[Illithids]] during [[The Illithid Invasion]], they came from [[The Space Outside Reality]], and began [[The Circle]]. Each of them is unimaginably powerful. They were once believed to be infinitely powerful, undefeatable in every way. This was until The Great Old One [[Goh'zul]], was defeated and their everlasting reign ended.

According to the interrogated [[Illithids]], [[Zol]] itself supposedly resides within the dead body of [[Goh'zul]]. This aligns well with the lore behind [[The Watcher]], so it is widely accepted by many. However this evidence is only based on interrogation and the word of the clergy.

The Great Old Ones are:
- [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]], the dead being in which [[Zol]] resides
- Xerc, The Contemplative
- Heit, The Calm
- Haesm'tarr, The Destructive
- Oben, The Incomprehensible
- Lith, The Thief
- None, The Hateful

They reigned over [[The Cosmos]] for all of time, until the defeat of Goh'zul, and the breaking of [[The Circle]].
