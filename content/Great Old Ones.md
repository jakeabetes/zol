# The Great Old Ones
A Great Old one is a unique progenitor being of the cosmos. They came from [[The Space Outside Reality]], and began [[The Circle]]. Each of them is equally powerful. They were once believed to be infinitely powerful, until The Great Old One [[Goh'zul]], was thwarted by [[The Wanderers]]. A powerful group of heroes from the realm of [[Artea]], who ascended to become [[The Wandering Gods]].

The Great Old Ones are:
- [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]], the dead being in which [[Zol]] resides
- Xerc, The Contemplative
- Heit, The Calm
- Haesm'tarr, The Destructive
- Oben, The Incomprehensible
- Lith, The Thief
- None, The Hateful

They reigned over [[The Cosmos]] for all of time, until the defeat of Goh'zul, and the breaking of [[The Circle]].
