# Observance
[[Observance]] is the first of the three wills. It is [[Magic]] derived from another being, or conscious source of power. It is also referred to as [[Lent Power]]. The lending of this power comes from a bond between an individual and their source. Some examples of this bond are:
- Devout Religious Belief
- A Pact
- A linked bloodline
- Personal Bond

And many others. This bond is not so easily gained.

The bond requires some direct connection to the source. A priest may spend his whole life devoting themselves to one of the [[Gods]], but that god may not see this person as a fit for their power and influence. Contrarily a priest may have been given a gift but never have sought it out in the first place.

These bonds typically come with visions, and sometimes the ability to speak directly to the source. 

The power from a bond is only as strong as the bond itself, and can become more powerful or weaken overtime. There are many records of individuals losing their bond entirely, or growing so strong that an individual embodies a large portion of their god's power for a brief moment.

As is true for all [[Magic]] in [[Zol]], power from [[Observance]] must first pass through [[The Trinity]] before reaching its user. Many who utilize the will of [[Observance]] draw from [[The Trinity]] itself as if it were a god of its own, and bear witness to some manifestation of it.
