title: "The Wrath Wastes"
---
Once a lush and strange forest called Galfora. Technically part of [[Gethsemane]], [[The Wrath Wastes]] are now an dangerous and barren wasteland of sharp jagged stone and grey sand. Their destruction was an effect of the [[Western War]]. The enemies of [[The Glassius Reach]] were marching through the area on a campaign to destroy the northern kingdom. However they were stopped in their tracks when a single man entered the fray. No one knew where he came from, or why. However he was like a god of destruction.

It turned out he had been the bearer of [[The Word of Wrath]]. A single individual who slaughtered nearly the whole army, and ended the [[Western War]]. The destruction of the battlefield was so thorough that it remains barren to this day.
