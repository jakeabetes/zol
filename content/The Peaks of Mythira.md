![[The Peaks of MythIra.png]]

The sacred mountains of the [[Dwarves]], filled with fire and precious [[Mythril]]. These imposing peaks are home to cities, riches, and many [[Dragons]].

It is not know what geological process creates [[Mythril]], some say it is naturally occurring, others think it a gift of the [[Gods]]. Regardless of its origin it is not found anywhere other than [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. A magical metal famed for its usage within the art of [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].

Within its peaks lies the peaceful city of [[Ep Drukar]], home to the spiritual [[Genasi]]. In the east, within the range's mountain [[Kalamdola]] lies the grand dwarven city of [[Mod Dranor]].

The range has also provided [[The Glassius Reach]] with isolation and defense from the outside world. Something they heavily depend on.
