title: "Speakers"
---Those who know at least a small portion of [[The Old Tongue]]. These individuals are revered across [[Zol]] as the peak of the magical arts. Being exposed to the power of [[The Old Tongue]] has strange effects on a person. Some speak of being shown strange visions about the world they live in at the time of their first usage of [[The Old Tongue]]. Some call this event, The Uttering. The effects of it are said to leave a person changed, and when meeting a Speaker you can tell that there is something more to them at their edges. They are extremely powerful individuals.
