---![[Gethsemane.jpg]]

The Viridescent Kingdom of [[Gethsemane]]. The land of [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and the peaceful [[Genasi]]. [[Gethsemane]] is an old and unvarying kingdom. Outsiders have a difficult time navigating these lands, and [[The Iron Tracks]] are barely present here. This makes the whole kingdom feel almost mythical to outsiders. Each city rules itself with its own unique laws. The region as a whole operates under an allegiance between Elven and Dwarven kingdoms, with the peaceful [[Genasi]] as their neighbors.

Traditions of art, craftsmanship, and magic that date all the way back to [[The Awakening]] are visible all throughout its cities.

## Cities
- [[Xerul]]
- [[Mod Dranor]]
- [[Laelanor]]
- [[Jerda'll]]
- [[Ep Drukar]]

## Wilderness and Climate
[[Gethsemane]] is a lush and beautiful land. It's dominated largely by [[The Forest of Yan Nalora]]. A wood of massive trees, crystal streams, as well as strange and dangerous creatures. Tucked into the north are its two mountain cities. The peak city of [[Ep Drukar]], and the subterranean city of [[Mod Dranor]]. These cities are located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]], a grand and perilous range of mountains overlook the garden kingdom.

A second subterranean city is located near central [[Gethsemane]]. [[Jerda'll]] is a kingdom of [[Drow]] built within the colossal caves that wind beneath the land called [[The Underdark]]. A mysterious natural world filled with underground lakes and rivers.

While glorious, the wilds are quite dangerous. There is only a single train in [[Gethsemane]] which runs from [[Laenwalde]] to [[Mod Dranor]] for trade purpose. All other travel is by forest road. Outside travelers are urged to move through the region with the help of a well trained guide, lest the find themselves attacked or lost in the wilderness.

## History
After [[The Awakening]], the people of [[Gethsemane]] found themselves in consolidated groups made up of members of their own races. These individuals initially met the same hardships as everyone else, however after a short while they learned that they could live symbiotically with the wilds through knowledge, [[Magic]], and a mutual respect for the environments they lived in.

The [[Dwarves]] mined into the mountains to construct their kingdom of [[Mod Dranor]], and the [[Elves]] built grand cities highlighting the natural beauty which was already present. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered the presence of one another quite early on. These groups were cautious at first, but found that through mutual respect the cities could coexist.

To the south was a region known as The Badlands. A feudal realm that would eventually go on to become [[Laenwalde]]. There were many skirmishes at the borders with gangs of roving bandits and small armies of feudal kingdoms. [[Gethsemane]] played an instrumental hand in the forming of this kingdom through support of troops and resources during particular hardship. [[Gethsemane]] is especially to thank for the current state of [[Eucaren]], the north-eastern, and neighboring third of [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] are close allies to this day.

Across [[The Narrow Sea]], lies the kingdom of [[Kapesh]]. They would go on to become a rivalling kingdom for more than a thousand years. [[Gethsemane]] battled [[Kapesh]] on and off in a conflict known as the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. A war incited by racial and religious differences.

It wasn't until much later (the year 2811) that the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered that there was a whole city of [[Genasi]] located within the far west peaks of the mountains. This came as a surprise to all parties involved, but there was no major issues that arose as the [[Genasi]]'s lifestyle and demeanor was already very on par with the rest of the kingdom. The [[Genasi]] were determined to be [[Off-Human]] by the elves, a label problematic within the conflicts surrounding the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. However [[Gethsemane]] decided to let the city be as they had remained in the mountains for over two thousand years without ever causing even a quarter of a problem.

In the late [[First Age]], [[Gethsemane]] and their ally [[Laenwalde]] faced a great deal of political infighting. When investigated, the source of this infighting seemed to stem from [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] masking as important members of their society. This sparked a conflict known as the [[Western War]] where [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] led a counter attack on The Reach. It amounted to one of The Reach's cities, [[Yorn et Gaul]], nearly being destroyed. The conflict stopped when a very powerful [[Wordbearer]] called [[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]] entered the fray to the defense of [[The Glassius Reach]].

Eventually in the early [[Second Age]] [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] set aside their differences and formed the [[The Triumvirate]] Concord to end their fighting.

## Inhabitants
Largely populated with [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and a small population of [[Genasi]].

Save for the [[Genasi]] city of [[Ep Drukar]], [[Gethsemane]] is an extremely proud and xenophobic kingdom. Each city holds a very strong identity and its citizens do not respond well to anything that may harm it. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]] live long lives and spend most of them focused on upholding or improving their society.

There are members of other [[Races]] sprinkled throughout the kingdom, but these individuals are seen as outsiders. At best, they may be welcomed in if they have something special like a well honed skill or gift to offer elven society. However they are more often ignored, or disliked.

[[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] have a mutual respect but tend to view each other as *lesser*. Elves think dwarves are bull headed, slow witted, and do not have appreciation for the beauty in art. Dwarves think elves are weak bodied, frivolous, and unproductive beings. They do cohabitate in some cities, but usually in neighborhoods dominated by members of their own race.

[[Genasi]] are people of tradition. They reside high in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Rarely leaving their territory, they went undiscovered for many many years. When they were found, the cities of [[Gethsemane]] determined that they were a peaceful group and would be welcomed into their borders. In reality, very little changed. The [[Genasi]] remained in their home and the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] didn't bother them for the most part. A few curious members from each population did mingle and explore each other's cities. This behavior sparked a small movement of [[Genasi]] who venture out on pilgrimages into the far kingdoms.

## Government, Economy, and Laws
The Kingdom of [[Gethsemane]] are not governed by a single figure. Each city governs itself and its surrounding territory. The kingdoms do not operate as a council like [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], but rather a very strong, millennia old alliance.

Each city cares for its citizens in its own way. Those who have legitimate citizenship do not go without. Even if they are not financially stable. In Elven society it is very rare someone does not strive to contribute in some way to their city. Those who are unable to contribute still easily find food, shelter, and medicine (but its likely they would be looked down upon if they are able bodied). In dwarven society work is assigned if it is not sought out, and disobeying these assignments is seen as criminal. The [[Genasi]] have a socialist approach to their city and their slow way of life rarely raises issues. In all cases the sick and elderly are taken care of without question.

Each city is responsible for creating and upholding their own laws.

## Arts, Culture, and Religion
Art and culture is very deep seated within the cities of [[Gethsemane]].

The [[Elves]] are known for creating nature-inspired majesty. They practice nearly every craft one could imagine. Individuals spend their entire lives honing their abilities to great heights. This is visible all throughout their societies. Grand architecture, beautiful clothing, fantastic sculptures and paintings, even their armor and weaponry is awe inspiring.

[[Dwarves]] treasure strength, quality, and practicality. This is visible in their cities, homes, tools, and general ways of life. Known for carving their homes and building directly from [[Kalamdola]], their home mountain. Powerful square architecture, engineered with comprehensive mathematics and geometry.

Echoes of their grand city are seen in their smaller works of craftsmanship as well. The precise support pattern upholding the grand bridges that span over the city are sewn into the hemming of garments. The layouts of crucial buildings are embossed onto their army's shields.

Most important to the [[Dwarves]] is the craft of smiting. The tools, weapons, and armor crafted within the city of [[Mod Dranor]] are the finest in all the Three Corners.

[[Genasi]] are people of the four elemental planes:
- Invigorant, water
- Immolation, fire
- Temperament, stone
- Tempest, air
Their art and beliefs surround the poetic ideals that surround these natural phenomena.

Almost all the people within the kingdom all follow some version of Trinity-Centric or Zolaen-Centric belief.

## Academics and Magic
Academics and Magic within [[Gethsemane]] are taught exclusively through mentorship. Nearly all individuals the kingdom spend the first centaury of their life under the mentorship of a set of teachers who specialize in different crafts. Individuals will go on to specialize in craftsmanship, art, magic, academics, or some other career. They will typically go on to spend the majority of their lives in this profession.

Notably, [[Gethsemane]] does not implement [[Iron Light]] as abundantly as the rest of the Three Corners does. This is due to a deep seated pretention around the concept of [[Great Magic]], a highly debated racial issue regarding [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] being more magically gifted than [[Off-Human]] races. This held belief has made it so [[Artificers]] of [[Gethsemane]] utilize [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] for the production of their magical implements. [[Iron Light]] does exist within the kingdom, it is just uncommon and looked down upon.

## Political Climate
[[Gethsemane]] appears to have a very static inner political structure. The people of the cities have great love for their rulership, and the rulers themselves maintain good relationships with each other. There is no one ruler or capital, but outsiders tend to view [[Xerul]] as its defacto capital due to its resources, size, grandeur, and mythos around the [[Elves]].

The resources and cooperation shared between cities makes [[Gethsemane]] a powerhouse of a kingdom. All who have trifled with them have paid the price. Historically, [[Gethsemane]] has gone to war with all of its surrounding regions and has never lost. In modern day it is on good terms with all its neighbors, save for great tensions with [[The Glassius Reach]] since the [[Western War]].

The people of the kingdom are largely xenophobic, or racist towards outsiders. This is due to old beliefs held regarding [[The Undoing]] and [[Great Magic]]. A sizeable portion of the population does not support these beliefs, but millennia of discrimination is hard to overcome.

## Military
Tacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: modern [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] has the smaller military, but what they lack in size they make up for in almost every other aspect. [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] are generally more physically capable on average than any other race. Their long lifespans also make it so that they can become very well trained. On top of that, their legendary craftsmanship gives them a literal edge above their foes. All ships in their navy's double as [[Airships]], meaning they need no sea port. There is good reason [[Gethsemane]] has never lost a war.

## Borders
[[Gethsemane]] borders the kingdoms of:
- [[Laenwalde]]
- [[The Glassius Reach]]
- [[Kapesh]]

It also has borders on the wilds of:
- [[Holyfield]]

It contains a portion of the mountain range known as:
- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]
- [[The Blades]]
- As well it decidedly does not consider [[The East Mounts]] within its borders as [[Elves]] believe the region to be cursed. This mountain range is as far south as some superstitious elves will travel.

It also has coasts on:
- [[The Vast Sea]]
- [[The Narrow Sea]]
