*The Rift City*
![[Tenzentak-skyline.png]]

Tenzentak, the Rift City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the sake of its nickname comes from the topography which the city rests upon and the fact that it is built on the cliffs of the grans nothing. The wide rifts within the city house a unique geological phenomenon called [[Rift Iron]], a valuable metal that regrows slowly after being mined. It is used to make objects that can reform after breaking.

This natural resource gives Tenzentak a stable economy, and hopeful future. Unfortunately, it also produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has developed powerful [[Iron Light]] air filters that utilize light from [[The Sun]] to clean the air. This ensures the city above the rifts remains clean and beautiful, but leaves those who live in the rifts to suffer.

At the cities eastern edge lies [[The Grand Nothing]], and [[Gilligan's Lift]] which is controlled by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].

## Authority
The city is led by Lady Helseena Trodak, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Tenzentak]]. Lady Trodak is a headstrong Dwarf of her later years. Her rule (in her own words) is one of 'balance'. [[Tenzentak]] faces unique challenges being the hub of outreach into [[The Grand Nothing]]. 

Lady Trodak seeks to maintain the economy to support the efforts of those who venture out into [[The Grand Nothing]]. In doing so she requires the export of [[Rift Iron]]. Unfortunately the mining and refinement of the material is the source of many of the city's issues. 

[[The Bladehammer Guild]] provides the Tenzentak Garrison, one of the guilds many subgroups, in exchange for much of its funding and tax exemption. This garrison acts as the city's guard, or army in times of war.

The authority of Lady Trodak wavers the deeper in the rift you go. The lowborn people mostly live by their own rules and codes, only occasionally being harassed by the garrison.

## Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In its current day an age, the city is the most accessible means for one to venture into [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many travel here to seek out the treasures hidden in the ruins of the old world.

It is also home to the headquarters of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. The guild is the largest operating party of mercenaries, scholars, craftsmen, and politicians. The guild is made up of many subgroups that have legitimacy all over [[Zol]]. Those who take up arms with the guild are given the agency to do much in the kingdoms of [[The Three Corners of Civilization]].

## Historical Importance
[[Tenzentak]] was one of the first cities to be founded in [[Zol]]. Its location on the cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]] was instrumental in [[The Dragon War]]. This was due to the strong up drafting winds that rise from the cliff. These gusts made for difficult sustained airborne combat for dragons.

Its defensible location also caused it to be the last of the Human cities to fall in the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Rebels were able to finally take the city by sending squads of soldiers to climb laterally along the cliffs edge and sabotage the cities defenses during the night.

## Other Things of Note
- The natural regrowth of [[Rift Iron]] creates toxic off-gassing called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has created filters powered by sunlight that cleanse the air for the upper city. However those who live in the rifts have to wear face coverings and often have health complications.
