# Tenzentak
*The Rift City*

Tenzentak, the Rift City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the sake of its nickname comes from the topography which the city rests upon. A set of wide rifts which house a unique geological phenomenon called [[Rift Iron]], a set of valuable metals that regrow slowly after being mined.

This natural resource gives Tenzentak a powerful economy, and stable future. Unfortunately, it also produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has developed powerful [[Iron Light]] air filters that utilize [[The Sun]] to clean the air. This ensures the city above the rifts remains clean and beautiful, but leaves those who live in the rifts to suffer.

At the cities eastern edge lies [[The Grand Nothing]], and [[Gilligan's Lift]] which is controlled by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].
