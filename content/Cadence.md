![[Cadence 2.png]]

He who is known by Manu Modica, Clausula, Cade, Ence, and Mao Leve. Known by many names and many forms, [[Cadence]] is the Wandering God of Adaptability. An ever-bending, forever-changing miasma that seeks harmony for the world.

## Depiction
[[Cadence]] is said to create a form for himself from the environment. A constellation of stars and a nimbus of clouds bending to appear as a leporine being. Distant hill top trees aligning to rabbit ears that perk up upon your notice. Steam rising over a pot of soup amalgamating to form his celestial silhouette.

When not tampering with the manifestation of the physical world, [[Cadence]] appears similarly to a [[Harengon]]. His body has an ancient yet powerful appearance, but his face maintains a youthful appearance.

## Moral
[[Cadence]] teaches the Moral of Adaptability. At its core, this ideal teaches one to seek harmony with all things through acceptance of any given circumstance. Stretching ones limit to not only seek survival, but prosperity. Overcoming obstacles by redefining what an obstacle is.

## Associations
[[Cadence]] is associated with:
- Music
- Culinary Arts
- Pirates
- [[Harengon]]
- Mischeif

## Realm
When travelling into [[Cadence]]'s reaches of [[The Unknown Realm]], the ground gives way to a strange cosmic space. Moving in this space is akin to swimming in air. 

The area is jumble of strange but enticing objects floating in the odd vacuum as far as the eye can see. Food, instruments, statues, works of art, books, furniture, even entire buildings constructed with *Non-Euclidean Geometry* bob about the air.

[[Cadence]] is said to spend his time here crafting these oddities. Academics are not sure as to why he would do this, and largely assume it is for his own enjoyment.

## Behavior
To the uneducated eye, [[Cadence]]'s behavior seems erratic and even chaotic at times. He is known to be a trickster who throws mortals into strange situations. His behavior may turn on a dime between generous or demanding.

Followers of [[Cadence]] claim that is is done to *challenge* mortals. it is thought that putting the world in a place where unexpected, but great things can occur sews seeds for Adaptability.

The scripture and beliefs around [[Cadence]] make him the most dramatic of [[The Wandering Gods]]. This increased drama can be seen in the demeanor of his followers.

## Worshipers
Cadence's followers are known to be erratic, but endearing. They follow his example, and never let the world predict their next move. They set about the [[Zol]], ever-chaotic, looking to find the most unexpected ways they can serve the greater good.

Some call these folk *Yes-men* (the only named group of followers that worship [[The Wandering Gods]]). They are known to do random acts like leaving a baked pie on someone's doorstep, or completing unfinished construction projects overnight. Once a group of Yes-Men in [[Arcadia]] shredded every ledger of tax collector in broad daylight, then turned themselves in to law enforcement.

Yes-Men organize themselves in regular secret meetings called *The Determining* where goals are set foreword and decided upon by the Yes-Men. These set goals may involve small local projects or large pilgrimages.

Yes-Men are proselytizers, always sharing the word of Cadence in the most unexpected manner. Skeptics see them as ne'er-do-wells seeking to disrupt the balance of their preferred systems, while others think they are kind hearted oddities who bring good luck wherever they go.
