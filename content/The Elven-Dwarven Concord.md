## The Elven-Dwarven Concord
[[Gethsemane]] was a place of high tension between the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. Their differences never sparked a true conflict but there was always an air of distrust between the two cultures. This changed after publication of [[The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from The Grand Nothing]].

The text illustrated the possibility of shared history between these individuals. Both groups may have faced the consequences of the humans actions in [[The Undoing]]. This theory acted as a major step stone towards an alliance between the two nations.

The groups formed a concord that allowed them to fruitfully share [[Gethsemane]] and defend it together. Despite the concord, the majority of [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]] do not like one another.
