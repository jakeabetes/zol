title: "Adjunct"
---
Within [[The Three Corners]], an [[Adjunct]] is a type of postal service who's communications are conducted via Span Reads. A type of [[Apparatum]] that uses Iron Light for long-distance communications. These apparatum are expensive, sensitive, and require direct connections to one another. These facts make complex communication networks a challenge. Adjuncts compensate for this challenge by acting as an third party during communications between individuals and organizations who interact via Span Read. Messages can be passed to other known clientele, or even passed to distant couriers who will attempt to hand deliver messages in the recipient's city.

Adjuncts keep some of the most comprehensive civil records across [[The Three Corners]]. They track registered citizens, businesses, political organizations, noble houses, temples, churches, and outer villages with great verbosity. Their records aren't always up to date, but Adjuncts do their best to keep them relevant. Adjuncts are also very generous with their records, at least to other Adjuncts. This generosity keeps their network of communication up to date and healthy.

Adjuncts across [[The Three Corners]] are named based off of a shared format. The format is typically: "Adjunct-Region Number-City Number-Local Number".

## Region Numbers
Region Numbers denote which part of the world the Adjunct is located in:
- 1 - [[Audran]]
	- includes [[Heliodor]]
- 2 - [[Saen]]
- 3 - [[Eucaren]]
	- includes [[Elysium Station]]
- 4 - [[Gethsemane]]
	- Notable as few Adjuncts exist in the region due to the fact its people do not adopt the usage of [[Apparatum]] frequently
- 5 - [[Kapesh]]
- 6 - [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]
Other regions have been indexed by Adjunct practice, but are not currently used as no Adjuncts exist within the region.
- 7 - [[The Glassius Reach]]
	- Its people do use [[Apparatum]], albeit infrequently compared to other kingdoms. However, they are politically isolated, so their span reads, few in number, are not part of the [[Adjunct]] network.
- 8 - [[The Ward]]
	- Its people are largely religiously opposed to the use of [[Apparatum]]. As a result, there are no [[Adjunct]]'s in the region.
The following regions are indexed, but contain no proper cities.
- 9 - [[Holyfield]]
- 10 - [[The Kulpis Desert]]
- 11 - [[The Korus Arctic]]
- 12 - [[The Grand Nothing]]
	- Though contacting [[The Bladehammer Guild]] in [[Tenzentak]]is an efficient way to get messages down to [[The Grand Nothing]] via [[Gilligan's Lift]].
- 13 - [[The Witchlands]]

## Local Number

## Example
For instance, the [[Adjunct]] located within The Whistles of [[Tenzentak]] is known as "Adjunct-6-1-2".
