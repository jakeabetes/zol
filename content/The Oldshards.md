At the start of [[The Awakening]], the [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] found themselves in the possession of two strange relics called [[The Oldshards]].  No one knew the nature of these objects, but the [[Changelings]] bore a sort of recognition towards them, despite loosing all of their memories during [[The Undoing]].

[[The Oldshards]] became central to their societies and religions. They built their two cities around the entities: [[Corinth]] and [[Yorn et Gaul]].

The objects were capable of immense feats such as:
- Lending magical power to its followers
- Rebirth of those who worshipped it
	- Those reborn would regain old memories at the midway point in their lives
- Giving strange visions to its followers
	- Some think these are cryptic dreams, while others believe it visions from the past lives of souls who have gone through it
- Dispensing information to its followers
- Any child born in proximity to it emerges as a full blooded changeling, regardless of racial parentage.

To [[The Glassius Reach]], they are very sacred objects. To the other kingdoms they are seen as objects of evil, alien nature.

[[The Oldshards]] are:
- [[The Apex]] - Once of [[Yorn et Gaul]], now either lost or destroyed. An artifact known to poses influence over matter and energy, along side its other properties as one of [[The Oldshards]]
	- Symbolized as a tall, narrow trapezoid, with the wider side on top
- [[The Vertex]] - of [[Corinth]] An artifact know to poses influence over possibility, fate and may even be able to influence time itself, along side its other properties as one of [[The Oldshards]]
	- Symbolized as a tall, narrow pentagon

Some think these objects are from [[The Before]], while others believe they are not even from [[Zol]] at all, possibly something even older than [[Zol]] itself.
