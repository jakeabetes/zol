---# The Oldshards
*[[The Apex]] and [[The Vertex]]*

At the start of [[The Awakening]], the [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] found themselves in the possession of two strange relics called [[The Oldshards]].  No one knew the nature of these objects, but the [[Changelings]] bore a sort of recognition towards them, despite loosing all of their memories during [[The Undoing]].

[[The Oldshards]] became central to their societies and religions. They built their two cities around the entities: [[Corinth]] and [[Yorn et Gaul]].

The objects were capable of immense feats such as:
- Lending magical power to its followers
- Rebirth of those who worshipped it
	- Those reborn would regain old memories at the midway point in their lives
- Giving strange visions to its followers
	- Some think these are cryptic dreams, while others believe it visions from the past lives of souls who have gone through it
- Any child born in proximity to it emerges as a full blooded changeling, regardless of parentage.

To [[The Glassius Reach]], they are very sacred objects. To the other kingdoms they are seen as objects of evil, alien nature.

[[The Oldshards]] are:
- [[The Apex]] - Once of [[Yorn et Gaul]], now either lost or destroyed
- [[The Vertex]] - of [[Corinth]]

Some think these objects are from [[The Before]], while others believe they are not even from [[Zol]] at all, possibly something even older than [[Zol]] itself.
