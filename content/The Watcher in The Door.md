![[The Watcher in the Door.png]]

[[The Watcher in The Door]], also known as [[The Watcher]], is the being who spun the [[Sea of Monsters]] by speaking [[The First Tongue]]. He created the pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]]. The Watcher was also the first being ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], the being who's corpse became [[Zol]].

The Watcher is seen as [[Zol]]'s founder, protector, and visionary by his followers. He guides [[Zol]] through chaos and suffering to a true and perfect paradise. Those who follow him and his will be reborn in the perfect world, and those who stray into sin will be left to fall in darkness.

## Depiction
The Watcher is depicted in 2 ways. The first and more simple is as an ordinary man. This may be of any age or creed. His skin is covered in scars from his battle with [[The Wretch]]. His sword, [[Voidbane]], is always present in some form.

His second form is one of legend. Described as an endless sea of celestial light and power. Scripture tells of mortals who were blinded when they gazed upon this form in the flesh. Clergy who claimed to have seen this form in dreams or visions describe an experience of passion, awe, and fear beyond that of anything else.

## Symbolism
The Watcher's symbol is an empty arched door, matching that of the planar [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for divinity.

## Behavior
The Watcher is known for being kind and protective to his followers, but direct and wrathful to those who would oppose him. The Watcher seeks to uphold his laws for the greater good of [[Zol]].

## Realm
The Watcher resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], a celestial landscape above the clouds. It bears a valiant golden palace for the [[The Watcher]], his greatest followers, and his chosen dead.

## Worshipers
The followers of The Watcher are conservative in nature. Following the rules set in scripture, these individuals worship and pray to their god of light in cathedrals all over [[Zol]].

## Relationship to The First Tongue
The Watcher created [[The First Tongue]] when he spun the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]]. It is not known exactly, but it is thought that:
- The watcher knows all words from [[The First Tongue]]
- The watcher uses this power to achieve his god hood OR the power proceeds from him, and [[Wordbearers]] are mere extensions of him.
	- The exact truth is not known, and sparks much debate amongst the clergy
