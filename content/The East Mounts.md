---# The East Mounts
![[The Eastmounts.png]]

The cursed mountains of east [[Laenwalde]]. Feared by the elves of [[Gethsemane]], and rarely traversed by explorers. These otherwise unassuming peaks are thought to hold a great evil.

It is not known what caused the region to posses such dark properties, and one would simply pass them by without a second thought. However those who climb their slopes tell tales of walking corpses, dark cults, pools of blood, and a deep sense of dread.

## Location
These mountains are located within [[Eucaren]] of [[Laenwalde]]. They are also decided edge of [[Gethsemane]], as the [[Elves]] claim the region to be unholy.
