title: "Heliodor"
---*The city of the Sky, Capital of [[Laenwalde]]*
![[Heliodore Skyline 2.png]]

Constructed in holy defiance of the [[Void Gods]] after [[The Castle of Bodies]] destroyed the previous capital, [[Audran]]. A wonderous feat of artificing, [[Heliodor]] is a floating city that hovers thirty five thousand feet above Gharl's Strait. It is a small, but fantastical city. It serves as the hub of political power and nobility. It is more of a giant castle than a true city. It is only accessible via [[Airships]] or [[Teleportation Circles]] due to its high altitude. The city is capable of aeronautical movement, teleportation and performing a terrestrial landing, but it spends most of its time above its sister city [[Elysium Station]] where Airship Ferries move passengers and good to and from the city.

| Main Opportunity         | [[Heliodor]] is a city that feels like it is on top of the world. Figuratively and literally. It is full of hundreds of important people who come and go like the inner working of some great societal machine. Being in the city feels like being inside the heart of society itself. The shops, inns, and other services are of the highest quality, and it is all built to cater to the needs of its guests. |
| Main Challenge           | The city's original vision was a capital that could be present all over the massive kingdom. A place where the city's rulers could keep their finger on the pulse of [[Laenwalde]], and the people could feel watched over and cared for. However the tendencies of nobility have altered this vision. Be it consciously or unconsciously, the upper class always tend to push away the common folk to a comfortable arms length. [[Heliodor]] has become a place with the infrastructure to monitor and rule over the massive kingdom, or where nobility can live in luxury and ignorance if they choose. The latter is the most common. The city is very exclusive, if you are not a resident you require invitation to enter. Servants require a [[Flatkey]] to work within the city. Prices of goods and services are very steep to keep out riff raff, some formal invitations to the city even require cover costs of food, lodging, and provide a per diem if a guest is not well off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| High Nobility      | Social Class     | The top of the top within the noble circles of [[Laenwalde]]. High Lords, High Ladies, Merchant Tycoons, Guild Leaders, Upper ranking members from [[The University]], Military Leaders, Foreign Diplomats, and people of the like. The kingdom and city look to these people for direction. At the top of their hierarchy sits [[King Tatelak II]] and his Golden Council.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Nobility           | Social Class     | The vast majority of the city's locals and visitors. Those who are of great import to the kingdom, but do not carry the sway of high nobility. They live in great luxury, and are supposed to conduct very important business within the city. However many only partake in the former.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Servants           | Social Class     | Those who come from [[Elysium Station]] station to serve within the city. These are usually lowly positions such as personal servants, guards, cooks, cleaners, maintenance, shop keepers, and things of the like. Socially, the are expected to keep their heads down and not cause trouble. Controversial sociologists have compared their behaviors to that of slaves. This is understandable because slaves are not allowed within the city for security reasons, and they have taken up the next closes role. The vast majority of servants are required to leave the city and head to [[Elysium Station]] after their shift work is completed. |
| Kingsguard         | Occupation/Guild | The military presence responsible for keeping law within the city. Members of this group exist on a spectrum which varies from devout elite (usually from [[The First Bastion]]), to lazy oaf who was lucky enough to be stationed in the capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| The Golden Council | Occupation       | Those responsible with counseling the king. They are the most powerful within their domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Modern Importance
[[Heliodor]] is considered to be almost mythological by outside views. If it weren't for its fame, many would doubt its existence. It is a floating city, a marvel of technology and magic. It acts as the hub of all important ongoings within [[Laenwalde]].

## Historical Importance
[[Heliodor]] is a very young city. It was constructed to replace the old capital, [[Audran]] which was destroyed by [[The Castle of Bodies]]. Its make resembles the appearance of the horrible void god in an effort to defy the destruction the kingdom once faced.

## The Creation of Heliodor
Long after [[Laenwalde]] had recovered from the [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack on [[Audran]], the kingdom was still without a clear capital.

To remedy this, the nobility came up with a frivolous design that [[Artificers]] of [[The University]] made into reality. A floating golden city, almost defiant of [[The Castle of Bodies]]. While having obvious issues, like alienation of lower classes in the capital, [[Heliodor]] does seem to offer a beacon of hope to the people of [[Zol]].

Built outside of [[Ryze]], [[Heliodor]] is capable of both vertical and lateral movement at a slow pace. It has many failsafes in place ensuring that the city will land before it crashes. The city is small in comparison to its terrestrial cousins, but this is by design. Its primary function is a political headquarters for [[Laenwalde]].

## Societal Effect of Separation from the Surface
Initially the city served its function very well, however after many years some nobility have had their altitude cloud their judgment. A divide has formed between the everyday people of [[Laenwalde]] and the ruling powers of [[Heliodor]].
