# Heliodor

## The Creation of Heliodor
Long after [[Laenwalde]] had recovered from the [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack on [[Audran]], the kingdom was still without a clear capital.

To remedy this, the nobility came up with a frivolous design that [[Artificers]] of [[The University]] made into reality. A floating golden city, almost defiant of [[The Castle of Bodies]]. While having obvious issues, like alienation of lower classes in the capital, [[Heliodor]] does seem to offer a beacon of hope to the people of [[Zol]].

Built outside of [[Ryze]], [[Heliodor]] is capable of both vertical and lateral movement at a slow pace. It has many failsafes in place ensuring that the city will land before it crashes. The city is small in comparison to its terrestrial cousins, but this is by design. Its primary function is a political headquarters for [[Laenwalde]].

## Societal Effect of Separation from the Surface
Initially the city served its function very well, however after many years some nobility have had their altitude cloud their judgment. A divide has formed between the everyday people of [[Laenwalde]] and the ruling powers of [[Heliodor]].
