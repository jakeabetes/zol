Within [[Zol]] there are many different naturally occurring materials which can be used across many types of craftsmanship. Some of these are naturally magical metals which are highly sought after. 

## Types of Metal

What follows is a list containing some of [[Zol]]'s magical metals. Magical metals are not limited to this list, but these are the most commonly referenced in academic materials.

*Rarity is based on how easily acquirable it is to society. Some metals are so rare that their existence is questioned. These metals are noted as 'Mythical'*

| Metal | Rarity | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iron | Very Common | Can be inscribed with runes from the [[Ferric Alphabet]], allowing for the metal to interface with one's [[Vizir]], producing [[Iron Light]], acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fey]] |
| Silver | Common | Acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fell]] |
| Gold | Common | Emits radiant [[Energy]] |
| Mythril | Rare | [[Mythril]] is an extremely strong metal that emits very potent [[Diaphanous Magic]], very culturally significant to [[Dwarves]] and their religion. Mythril is famous for its harmonious compatibility with other magical materials. |
| Giant's Bone | Rare | Fossils of ancient [[Giants]] that can be smelted into potent metals. Properties depend on samples, but include things like: high density and low weight, elemental [[Energy]], increasing physical abilities of living creatures. Modern Giant's Bone does not posses this quality, it must be of a fossil. |
| Dragon Scale | Rare | Scales from [[Dragons]] of at least 100 years of age. These scales can be smelted into potent metals, or incorporated into creations in their raw form. The older the Dragon the scales came from, the more rare and powerful the magic. Scales from a dragon over 500 years are very rare, and over 1000 years are extremely rare. When used correctly, dragon scale can produce immense magical effects. |
| Adamantine | Very Rare | One of the hardest known naturally occurring substances. Extremely sought after by armorers and weapon smiths |
| Faenite | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fey]]. Possesses strange, and untethered magic which is often called Wild Magic. |
| Beastmetal | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fell]]. Similar to Iron in many of its properties, Beastmetal is made unique by the fact that is has been found to provoke violence in it those around it. This is most obvious on wild beasts. It also has a small range of lesser know effects such as its ability to absorb light, and things of similar nature. |
| Dimeritium | Very Rare | A metal found in the deep [[The Underdark]]. It possesses strange antimagical abilities. Its function is understood as emitting an ever-decaying field of raw magical [[Energy]]. This disrupts other [[Magic]] exposed to the field, as well as one's connection to [[The Trinity]]. Sometimes called *Magebane*. |
| Potentium | Very Rare | A rare metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It can be imbued with magical [[Energy]] changing the material properties and structure of the metal permanently. Doing so is a great challenge, but is extremely useful. Often used to make weapons and ammunitions. Potentium, when charged, is said to be able to influence the properties of other nearby non-magical metals. Making them more akin to their own structure temporarily. Similar to how a Loadstone can influence other metals to be magnetic. |
| Momentium | Very Rare | A strange metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It has an amplifying effect on any momentum applied to it. Often used in Firearms and [[Skimmers]]. |
| Meteoric Shard | Extremely Rare | Foreign metal of cosmic origin. Suspected to be sourced from meteorites from [[The Cosmos]]. Only found within the western sands of [[Saen]] and The Ghalt Kratur of [[The Witchlands]]. All recovered shards are of a common material, but each recorded use of their application produces a unique magical effect. Little is understood about Meteoric Shards |
| Seraphium | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. It has immense magical properties. Many holy relics are comprised of Seraphium. Its properties cover a wide spectrum, but it is know to produce wonderous magic, strength, durability, and energetic capacity. |
| Void Slag | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Void]]. It's unholy status, and unpredictable effects have secured it a special place in myth and academia. Those have tampered with it have said it is extremely difficult to work with, and produces *undesirable* effects. |
| Hag Metal | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in folklore regarding [[Hags]]. Said to be so toxic, that touching it can cause it to absorbed through the skin, forever changing a person. There are a small collection of mythical weapons said to be made from it. |
| Morhin | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in religious texts regarding [[The Wandering Gods]], said to be so desirable even gods seek it out. |

## Potentium Sub-Metals
When Potentium is exposed to a high concentration of elemental [[Energy]], its alchemical structure and magical properties can be permanently altered. Once altered, it cannot be altered again, or alloyed with any known metal. It is even possible to infuse Potentium with multiple types of elemental [[Energy]] to create hybrids, given you expose it to the correct energy concentrations simultaneously.

The Potentium Sub-Metals are:

| # | Name | Elemental Energy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ignitium | Fire |
| 2 | Fridigite | Cold |
| 3 | Excitium | Lightning |
| 4 | Necrodite | Necrosis |
| 5 | Radallium | Radiant |
| 6 | Toxium | Poison |
| 7 | Corrodium | Acid |

Hybrids between Potentium Sub-Metals are extremely difficult to make. They are often called by their elemental numbers. Potentium exposed to lightning and radiant [[Energy]] in the correct concentrations becomes *III-IV Potentium*.

## Other information
- [[Artificers]] often refer to [[Magical Metals]] as *Strong* metals. This isn't in reference to their physical strength (however, many magical metals are quite strong which is known to further confusion amongst non-academics). It is instead in reference to their strong magical potential. Non-magical metals such as tin, zinc, and mercury are referred to as Weak Metals. These names are reflected in the [[Ferric Alphabet]] table.
