## Description
No one knows exactly what [[Plasmoid]] are, and they very well may be multiple types of creatures grouped together based on similar characteristics, and lack of information about them. They appear as beings formed of some viscous substance. They have been observed altering their own form to fit their needs. This involves growing extra limbs, altering their size, and things of the like. Documented [[Plasmoid]] vary greatly in their descriptions. Some claim to have accidentally created them during magical experimentation, comparing them to [[Warforged]]. Others write of encounters with [[Plasmoid]] who claim to have come from [[The Cosmos]].
