title: "Mimics"

[[Mimics]], also called *Ayadon'ae* by the [[Changelings]] are a species of beings who hail from [[The Glassius Reach]]. The posses the ability to alter their form similarly to [[Changelings]]. However, [[Mimics]] are known to impersonate objects, rather than people. Beyond that, ancient mimics are immensely powerful.

## Origin
Mimics are incredibly secretive beings. Most of what is known about them is drawn from legend and speculation. It is said that the first generation of [[Mimics]] were stones animated by some force. There are those who believe they were made by the [[Gods]], others think them a product of [[The Oldshards]]. There are myths of them being holy protectors of something ancient, and there are those of them being dangerous monsters from [[The Void]].

In either case, they are said to be born in generations. The First Generation of [[Mimics]] were granted immense [[Magic]] which allowed them to create other mimics. Each generation with slightly different powers. Though it is said that only the first was capable of creating other [[Mimics]]. Academics believe that the older a Mimic is, the more intelligent and powerful it is. Making each generation slightly less powerful as a product of time.

Most modern day [[Mimics]] that are encountered are more akin to beasts, or simplistic monsters. They spend long periods of time pretending to be objects that devour prey when they get close. Though there are accounts of ancient mimics being encountered, who are all extremely dangerous and intelligent.

## Society
Legends speak of a secret society of [[Mimics]] within [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Some say that they live in dark caves, others believe that they have a city of their own. There are no formal records of this place. In Glassian Lore, this place is called *Mastara*.
## Physiology
[[Mimics]] have complete control over the physiology. They can change their body to any size and shape. However the larger they are, the more food they need to sustain themselves.

Younger generations of [[Mimics]] must remain completely still for their forms to be convincing, but later generations can do wonderous feats like making themselves appear as living things.
## Relationship to The Oldshards
The few encounters that have been recorded with the earlier generations of [[Mimics]] describe some fascination, or reverence with [[The Oldshards]]. It is not known why they orbit around their locations.
