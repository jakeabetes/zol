We had purpose, but it in no way belonged to us. Our path was flanked by low walls. Physically, we could stray, but unbeknownst to us we would be returned time and time again until we decided correctly. Until our actions were performed to perfection. Their ultimate will. We were irrigated like water. Allowed to flow by our nature, but silently reprimanded when we spilled over into the greater breadth of possibility. Our paths cut deeper to eliminate life's natural desire and meander.

We were only saved by the very tool that bound us. Domain.
