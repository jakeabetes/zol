title: "The Coven"
---Once a unmatched, unified coven of 14 powerful witches. Now fractured into two rival groups. The remaining 9 of [[The Coven]], and the 4 traitors of [[The Cult of the Mothers]]. [[The Coven]] is the closest thing to a governing force within [[The Witchlands]]. They are a powerful faction of witches who all unite under a single ideal: preservation of [[The Witchlands]]. The coven is comprised of:
- The Hearth Witch, Luna Elzamore of Zorberg
- The Kitchen Witch, Mare Palamore of Everfall
- The Cosmic Witch, Staedtler Zizen of The Ghalt Kratur 
- The Swamp Witch, Oppolis of the Z'veril Swamp
- The Eclectic Witch, Grimsby Bazlo of The Painted Stones
- The Crystal Witch, Celestine Agatha of The Caves of Ghar Nalon
- The Death Witch, Tall Ester of The Mortal Valley
- The Folk Witch, Hal Draen of The Alktree Haven
- The Sex Witch, Lir of The Temple of The Moons
Each witch is of immense power, and most have a small coven of their own which they lead. However this coven of great and powerful witches is what keeps the balance in [[The Witchlands]].
