# Aldem, King of all Hells
*Void God of Hell, Major Deity*
![[Aldem king of all hells.png]]

Lord of [[Fiends]], Conqueror of [[Damnation]]. [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] has domain over each and every layer of hell that exists in [[Zol]]. 

Before the defeat of [[Goh'zul]], the great old one consumed thousands of worlds. A common pattern amongst these devoured worlds was the creation of Hells and [[Fiends]]. These were made as an army of violent creatures manufactured to fight back against [[Goh'zul]].

These creations were fruitless in the end. After [[Goh'zul]] devoured their world, he would leave the Hells, for lack of a better term, undigested within his body.

This created a unique occurrence after the defeat of [[Goh'zul]]. More than a thousand hells drifted amongst his inner void. These unbound planes would collide with one another and fuse, eventually forming a single, unimaginably large realm of [[Damnation]].

Each of these realms had their own unique environment, laws, [[Fiends]], and rulers. These differences sparked a massive war amongst the [[Fiends]]. After an eon of fighting, Aldem emerged as the victor.

## Depiction
A towering being of a stony black skin that houses a  ethereal red substance that flows all about his form. He bears no discernable face on his head and his voice emanates powerfully from him in all directions. 

## Symbolism
curved horns cradling a skull.

## Behavior
Aldem is in his essence, a conqueror. He seeks any method possible of expanding his domain. He rules over all the layers of [[Damnation]] with an iron fist.

Aldem has a close relationship with [[The Coilwalker]], taking the unclaimed souls of the dead, or souls who have been marked for damnation.

When one thinks of eternal damnation, the think of torture, pain and horror. Much of [[Damnation]] is defined by this idea, but [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] does not punish all souls he comes into possession of. Some souls end up in the higher levels of [[Damnation]] where the environment is more like that of a strangely beautiful city. While others are sent to the lower levels to atone for their crimes.

## Realm
Aldem resides in [[Damnation]], a sub-plane of [[The Void]]. It exists on the border between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Void]]. It clings to [[The Underdark]], the stony foundation of [[Zol]].

Some natural fissures to [[Damnation]] exists in the darkest depths of [[Zol]].

## Worshipers
[[Aldem, King of all Hells]] is praised by many dark cultists and other forms of villainy who seek his power, or favor in death.
