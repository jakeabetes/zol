![[Aldem king of all hells.png]]

Lord of [[Fiends]], Conqueror of [[Damnation]]. [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] has domain over each and every layer of hell that exists in [[Zol]]. 

In [[Zolaen Scripture]], it is said that before the defeat of [[Goh'zul]], the great old one consumed thousands of worlds. A common pattern amongst these devoured worlds was the creation of Hells and [[Fiends]]. These were made to serve as armies of of violent creatures, manufactured for the sole purpose of fighting back against [[Goh'zul]].

These destructive creations were all futile attempts at resisting the cosmic being in the end. After [[Goh'zul]] devoured their world, he would leave the Hells, for lack of a better term, undigested within his body.

This created a unique occurrence after the defeat of [[Goh'zul]]. More than a thousand hells drifted amongst his inner void. These unbound planes would collide with one another and fuse, eventually forming a single, unimaginably large realm of [[Damnation]].

Each of these realms had their own unique environment, [[Fiends]], and rulers. These differences sparked a massive war amongst the [[Fiends]] within primordial [[Zol]]. After an eon of fighting, Aldem emerged as the victor.

## Depiction
A towering being of a stony black skin that houses an  ethereal red substance that flows all about his form. He bears no discernable face on his head and his voice emanates powerfully from him in all directions. 

## Symbolism
curved horns cradling a skull.

## Behavior
Aldem is in his essence, a conqueror. He seeks any method possible of expanding his domain. He rules over all the layers of [[Damnation]] with an iron fist.

Aldem is thought to have a close relationship with [[The Coilwalker]], taking the unclaimed souls of the dead, or souls who have been marked for damnation.

When one thinks of eternal damnation, the think of torture, pain and horror. Much of [[Damnation]] is defined by this idea, but [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] does not punish all souls he comes into possession of. Some souls end up in the higher levels of [[Damnation]] where the environment is more like that of a strangely beautiful city. While others are sent to the lower levels to atone for their crimes.

## Realm
Aldem resides in [[Damnation]], a sub-plane of [[The Void]]. It exists at the border between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Void]]. It clings to [[The Underdark]], the stony foundation of [[Zol]].

Some natural fissures to [[Damnation]] exists in the darkest depths of [[Zol]].

## Worshipers
[[Aldem, King of all Hells]] is praised by many dark cultists and other forms of villainy who seek his power, or favor in death.
