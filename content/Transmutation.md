# Transmutation
[[Transmutation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that specializes in the conversion of [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. Use of transmutation can change silver to gold, reshape earth, and alter ones physical form.

This magic is one of the most useful to the people of [[Zol]], but has some economical concerns. Properly changing matter from an invaluable state to a valuable one is quite difficult and not criminal, but some simple [[Transmutation]] is temporary and used in [[Currency]] scams.
