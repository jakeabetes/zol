title: "Iszertion"
---The written form of [[The Old Tongue]]. It is an immensely complex form of writing and [[Enchantment]] that only [[Speakers]] can use and understand. Unlike its sister practice of [[Iron Light]] which uses logic and mathematics, [[Iszertion]] is more instinctual and difficult to explain to those who do not know [[The Old Tongue]]. It is best described as utilizing the same powers that speaking [[The Old Tongue]] gives, but rather than speaking, it is written down. It is also important to know that merely being able to speak [[The Old Tongue]] does not mean one can utilize [[Iszertion]]. It is a skill that must be learned. It is possible to use [[Iszertion]] with any of [[The Wills]], but it is almost always associated with [[Arcana]]. This is likely because the manifestations of [[Speakers]] who utilize the wills of [[Observance]] and [[Viridescence]] do not lean on their own creations as often as [[Arcanists]]. 

The will that is being leveraged for [[Iszertion]] greatly changes the appearance of the characters and diagrams involved.
- [[Arcana]] - Appears as very exact geometry and strange symbol with no discernable alphabet behind them, each character is unique to its specific purpose.
- [[Viridescence]] - appears as flowing lines and intersecting round shapes
- [[Observance]] - appears as a single, complex rune made up of many intersecting lines, curves, and shaded areas

[[Iszertion]] can either directly change the properties of an object to accomplish magical feats. It can also be used to relay massive amounts of complex information as a form of writing.

Performing [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] using [[Iszertion]] takes a very long time, and is extremely dangerous. The chance of [[Magical Backfire]] is very great. It is often called Grand [[Arcana]], and it produces some of the most powerful magical objects. It is made much easier by utilizing magical components that already posses the properties one is seeking to imbue magically. A sword made with [[Iszertion]] will be much more successful if [[Mythril]] is used rather than mere steel.

## Relation to the Ferric Alphabet
Many have sought to form a connection between [[Iszertion]] and [[Iron Light]]. However there does not seem to be a correlation.

## Implications for The First Tongue
Since there is a written form of [[The Old Tongue]], many speculate that there is an equivalent for [[The First Tongue]]. However it is not known of if it even exists.
