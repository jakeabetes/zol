Hail, Trusted Guildminds.

Only the most crucial members of our organization have been sent this message. By now, you've read the guild's official statement on the God Killing, or Ahamatath as the clergy have dubbed it. This is our unofficial communication on the topic. Burn after reading.

Regardless of personal belief, the following information will be crucial for the years to come. All major, and most minor religious organizations across the three corners have attested to divine confirmation of Giriam's death. Irregular agriculture and varied population trends across the kingdoms and wild cities have already wrought havoc. Also, I have it on good authority that dragon sightings have more than doubled in all mountain ranges within our influence. Most are undocumented dragons. We expect this to become common knowledge in the coming months.

Religious, political, and economic turmoil have been projected by our best scholars. Disaster comes. Our allies reflect these findings in their own, independent work. Even if corrective infrastructure can be put in place, the shifts in power structure will spell chaos, terrorism, and war. This is our best-case scenario.

Worse, the implications of dragons reemerging and the absence of a god could have apocalyptic implications. We, as The Bladehammer Guild, are used to operating as one of Zol's most established organizations. My speakers tell me that if The Ahamatath holds true, our organization could be rendered insignificant. We do not have the tools to comprehend the true magnitude of what could be occurring. Let alone the capacity to stop it. My advisor, Speaker Murphy Gallain, said the best comparison would be if the wind itself died.

We do not know firsthand that Giriam is dead, and we may never have concrete evidence of the event. The world still needs salvation, even if we cannot provide it. If we cannot protect the world, then we will protect The Free Cities. Something moves against us. All of us. Be it deception, divinity, or something worse. These are unprecedented times, but The Bladehammer Guild must stand against it, even if we are to fail.

Fighting for, and forging fair,
Guild Master Helg Corsair
