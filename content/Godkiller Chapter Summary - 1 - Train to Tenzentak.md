title: "Godkiller Chapter Summary - 1 - Train to Tenzentak"
---
- **Chapter begins mid-morning the 11th of Spring, 4466**
- Our story began with a strange dream of a broken Warforged
- Upon boarding the train in the city of [[Rails]], our heroes met some odd new friends. Each other!
	- Deimos - A monster slayer and his friendly wolf, Wall'e
	- Rozwald - A noble artificer
	- Cyrus - A mysterious masked individual
	- Spade - A gruff drifter, and his fire-spirit Cinder
	- Magnus - A Stormblessed northerner and his draconic companion, Viz (Avizandym) 
	- and Sherman - a free-willed automaton care-taker
- The our heroes met The Three Fools. A party of established members of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]
	- Eddoch - a kindly dwarf clergyman
	- Laizen - an awkward, but kind elven swordsman and full marked guild member
	- Tardich - a grumpy and reserved cowboy
- The stretch of Guild cars along the train were interrupted by vault car and luxury car, cutting the party off from the dining car
- The long journey had left fuses short, and tension quickly formed between Magnus and Spade.
- it likely would have come to blows if the train hadn't been attacked by [[Warforged]] rebels
	- Tons of them shouting odd phrases of rebellion
	- Upon their death, they exploded into acid
- The attack was overwhelming, but luckily (or possibly unluckily) Haith Nallian, the Inheritor of Fire was aboard the train.
	- He expediently killed the attackers, and scorched the party in the process
- After the fight, our heroes checked on Vault and Luxury car. The assumed targets of the attack
	- The vault was emptied and its guards killed
	- Rozwald cleverly deduced it had been transporting a small, but dangerous container of 1-5 Potentium. A volatile and explosive member of the [[Magical Metals]] often used to create powerful bombs.
- In the luxury car, Curtis Renaull (nephew of Leonel VanVeld, The Alderian Seat of [[Holocene]]) was sure the attack was directed at him
	- He insisted the party protect him, the plainly declined
- The lot regrouped and recouped. Most members of the car found they couldn't help but fall asleep
- The cargo of The Three Fools was (unbeknownst to them) a very large cannister of gas used in [[Alchemy]], the unbound principal of sleep.
	- Those who were resistant to its influence were kind enough to tuck the party in
- Upon waking up, our heroes were brought to stand on the train car's roof to gaze upon the view of [[Tenzentak]]
