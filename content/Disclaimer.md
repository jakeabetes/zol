title: "Disclaimer"
---This is a fantasy world I originally created for hobbyist purposes. Primarily as a TTRPG campaign setting.

Things to note:
- The main concept I wanted to play with when writing the world of [[Zol]] is *agency*. For a common person in [[Zol]], life is very dangerous. There are many forces, gods monsters, and people who are much more powerful than the average individual. For most people, the main challenge in their life is to achieve some sort of agency so they can make a life for themselves. This is a great challenge in [[Zol]] as the world is extremely dangerous, and there are many political and social challenges.
- This collection of information was written as if it was from the perspective of an academic within [[Zol]]. With a few tid-bits of information added that would not necessarily be known by the people of [[Zol]] for the sake of storytelling. This means that almost all of the information in here could be known by a really really smart person, except for somethings like specific details to world creation lore that would have been lost to history.
- There are gaps intentionally left for the sake of speculation, and creative addition for anyone using this for their own purposes (Ex: TTRPGs).
- The world is provided in a way where there are many locations, characters, historical accounts, and other things of the like, however it is not meant to give one everything that they would need for something like a TTRPG campaign. [[Zol]] is meant to be added to beyond that of the material here. If I were going to write a TTRPG campaign in [[Zol]], I would create 70-80% of the things that are going to go within it and use this as a skeleton for the story.
- Controversial topics within [[Zol]]
	- In [[Zol]] there is no gender or sexual discriminations of any kind in its cultural history. However there is the inclusion of racial and religious discrimination. This is done for narrative device only. The discrimination is between fictional species of humanoid races and fictional religions and is not based on things like hair, skin, eyes, or anything else that would reflect a more real-world scenario. **In the case of [[Zol]] if there is a racist character, or one who would suppress religious freedoms, they are ALWAYS meant to be a villain**. There are no exceptions. 
	- In addition to racial discrimination, there is also [[Slavery]] within [[Zol]]. It is meant to be viewed within the same lens as racism, where slave owners, or other characters who perpetuate [[Slavery]] are **always** to be considered villains. The inclusion of such an inhumane practice is done with the intention of highlighting the vast differences of agency individuals have in [[Zol]].
	- There are allusions to modern day Christianity with topics like [[The Trinity]] being a major part of [[Zol]]. I personally am an atheist who grew up in a Christian house hold. I used the religious frameworks I was exposed to as a child to create a world where characters can explore the concept of agency and religion in a way where I felt like I could do it justice. There are parts of [[Zol]] that may seem very pro-religion or anti-religion. I am in no way aiming to make a statement of the rightness or wrongness of modern day Christianity with [[Zol]]. I personally aim to illustrate the wrongness of suppression of personal freedoms or beliefs through religion.
