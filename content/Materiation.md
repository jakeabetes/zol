*A human artificer suffering from very late stage Materiation, causing his torso to reduce to an odorless smoke that fades to nothing almost instantly. He has lived like this for over 2 dozen years and will likely live another decade.*

## Cause
Materiation occurs when a complex [[Iron Light]] [[Apparatum]] involves an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. Using these devices is hard on one's physical body. The exact reason for its occurrence is unknown.

## Symptoms
While frightening to observers, the affliction is described casually by its victims. While fatal, the afflicted claim to enjoy the experience as it makes them feel one with the world.

The ailment seems to give its victims a unique wisdom, euphoria, as well as a slight disconnect from society.

While fatal, the condition progresses slowly and is not accelerated by continued usage of dangerous [[Apparatum]]. Many afflicted live relatively normal lives ten to fifty years beyond diagnosis.

The bodies of the afflicted strangely continue to function even without vital organs that are removed or damaged by the disease. It is only fatal when it takes the brain or a vital section of spine.

Even after death the corpses of the afflicted continue to materiate. There is no cure for Materiation.

## Additional Information
Beings with artificial bodies have a high resistance to [[Materiation]]. The most common manifestation of this are [[Warforged]], who are frequently employed to operate dangerous devices.
