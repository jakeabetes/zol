![[The Brass Hall.png]]

Located within [[Brass Taldora]], [[The Brass Hall]] is the most prestigious education institution of the west. Part of [[The University]]'s [[Arcanum]], the wonderous school is located within the city of [[Ryze]]. It takes up a significant portion of the mega structure it resides within, and is home to many students. Famed for its successful [[Artificers]] and contributions to academia, many seek to gain a place within its ranks. It is filled with some of the sharpest minds, as well as some of the most arrogant ones. It is an extremely competitive institution. It has developed a great focus on [[Apparatum]] and [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].

The students and staff of [[The Brass Hall]] see themselves as the future of [[Zol]], but are often bogged down by the limitations of their craft, and its steep cost. Many members of the public see [[The Brass Hall]] as wonderous place of invention. Others see it as a bunch of hoity-toity fools who posses the intelligence to invent, but lack the wisdom to consider the effect of their inventions.

The school itself is a large nexus of beautiful lecture halls, workshops, and grand windows that overlook [[Ryze]] and its surrounding beauty. Often, members of the school will come and go via [[Airships]] as it is a much nicer means of travel than using the tower's lifts.

## Admission
Admission into [[The Brass Hall]] is quite difficult. One not only requires some form of prior education, they also require the means to pay for the expensive tuition, and a letter of recommendation from a credible academic. 

## Leadership
Led by the Grandmasters, a council of Arcanists who all follow the rule of the Head Chancellor, Grandmaster Whiles Gennador, an aged human man, and head of [[The Brass Hall]]. Brother to High Priest Tarsin Gennador who is head of [[The Obsidian Temple]].
