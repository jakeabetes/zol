# Riverbridge
*The waypoint of the world*

The most fought over city in all of [[Zol]]. [[Riverbridge]] is located on Stalke Island in the center of [[The Narrow Sea]]. Famous for its massive bridges that span east and west to cross [[The Narrow Sea]].

Its name, originally Sea Hold, was mistranslated several times in its constant change of rulership back and forth between [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. It is now home to a population mostly made up of equal parts [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. These parts do not get along very well.

|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city's is the most centrally located place in all of [[Zol]], it has little pieces of all of the world's culture all tied within it, and does not have the same feeling of oppressive crown rule as mainland [[Kapesh]]. Many sailors from all over [[The Narrow Sea]] and [[The Archsea]] frequent this city. |
| Main Challenge | The city has changed hands between [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] many of times. Due to this, the city is full of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].

## People Groups
| Group | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Nobility | Social Class | Those charged by the crown with running the city, or successful business owners. |
| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. |
| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work. Be it because of health issues, mental state, addiction, or some other personal reason. These individuals are extremely poor and are occasional persecuted for their begging and made to be slaves. |
| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |
| Human Population | Racial group | The Humans of the city, the politically extreme are very anti elf and dwarf and believe they should be removed from the city. |
| Elven Population | Racial Group | The Elves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with dwarves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |
| Dwarven Population | Racial Group | The dwarves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with elves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |
| Off-Human Population | Racial Group | The 'bystanders' of the city's racial conflicts. Once, Off-Human individuals were horribly mistreated by [[The Triumvirate]], but within [[Riverbridge]] they are strangely the neutral party and are able to freely mingle with any group. The most racist members of the other groups are known to say "at least you're not one of them" to the off humans. As one would expect, most off humans hate [[The Triumvirate]] and their stupid squabble within the city. |

## Authority
The city is overseen by Lady Trell Gallan, loyal servant to [[King Galliard]]. Lady Gallan is known for being a good ruler but faces many challenges with [[The Triumvirate]] population and its bickering.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In modern day the city is a hub of trade between the eastern and western kingdoms of [[Zol]]. It is also the bottleneck for the [[The Great Tracks]] as the bridges that span [[The Narrow Sea]] run through it.

## Historical Importance
[[Riverbridge]] was constantly fought over during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. It changed hands between both [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] many times. Both the city and sections of the great bridges had to be frequently rebuilt.

## Other Things of Note
- The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of the city could likely immigrate back to [[Gethsemane]] if they wished, given they could afford it. However most do not as their families have been living in the city for quite some time, and feel a sort of ownership of it. Leaving would be giving that up.
- The Great Bridges of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Kierketholl]]'s Megastructures.
