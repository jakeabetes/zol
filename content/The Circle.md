title: "The Circle"
---Spoken of in Trinity-Centric and Zolaen-Centric [[Religion]], [[The Circle]] is said to be the source which gave [[Goh'zul]], the cosmic entity which [[Zol]] resides in, his power. Little is said about [[The Circle]], but it is said that long ago, before reality existed, 7 beings discovered this power. When they took the power on, it turned them into what are now known as [[Great Old Ones]].

[[Great Old Ones]] are beings who possessed the capacity to create worlds, cultivate them, and consume them to sustain themselves. However [[Goh'zul]] was defeated, and the circle was shattered. It is not known what defeated [[Goh'zul]], or how the circle was broken. Many believe it was [[The Watcher]] who defeated him in his true form, as well as his soul within [[Oblivion]]. Others think it the influence of some cosmic war, some even think it was [[The Wandering Gods]].
