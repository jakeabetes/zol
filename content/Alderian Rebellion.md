title: "Alderian Rebellion"
---*The breaking of chains, and the founding of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]*

After the peak of the [[Triumvirate Battles]], [[Kapesh]] was left weak from the war with [[The Maul Bearer]] and his army. Most of the kingdoms resources were allocated to the coast of [[The Narrow Sea]] defending its borders against [[Gethsemane]].

This left South Kapesh without much of its normal defenses. Distant from the conflicts in the north east, a young [[Half-Orc]] man named [[Eirmond the Brave]]. Son of a prostitute, Eirmond was forced to watch the mistreatment of his mother and many others his whole life. When his mother was killed by an enraged human customer, he decided to begin a rebellion of his own.

[[Eirmond the Brave]] and many other [[Off-Human]] slaves, primarily [[Orcs]], took [[Ka'thoor]] with great bloodshed. Despite the losses, it was the first time rebels had taken a city in [[Kapesh]]. Rumors spread quickly, and another rebellion was sparked in [[Hanen]]. After much fighting, and aid from rebels in [[Ka'thoor]], [[Hanen]] was taken as well.

Human nobility were executed, and the lower human population would likely have been as well, if not for Eirmond's mercy. These individuals were given a choice, aid the rebellion or face exile. Many resisted and some chose exile, but a sizeable group decided to stay and fight alongside rebels.

[[Deepspell]] was the next strategic foothold to take, it was a difficult city to seize, especially with the aid of [[Kerketh Academy]] and their mages. It is likely the city never would have fallen, if not for a group of open minded students led by Alex Laro-Rissan, a charismatic noblemen's son who began a movement to stop the mages of the academy from fighting the rebels. Some say it was an act of honor, while others believe it was done in defiance of his parentage. Eventually it broke out into infighting within the academy. Ultimately rebels prevailed and the border between north and south [[Kapesh]] was secured.

It was at this time, the city of [[Holocene]] surrendered without prompt. The city and their nobles were kept safe and it became one of the rebels cities. This annexed the southern half of the region off from north [[Kapesh]].

[[Rails]] and [[Zessgorn]] were taken soon after. [[Zessgorn]] notably by a group of slaves already within the city. This only left [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, this was when [[Kapesh]] began making headway with their counter-attack. [[Ka'thoor]] was retaken, and the human forces then moved on to [[Hanen]].

Remarkably, [[Hanen]] held out against 3 major attacks by [[Kapesh]] with no support, and almost no resources. This one in a million chance forced [[Kapesh]] to retreat to [[Ka'thoor]]. They were ambushed by the forces of [[Holocene]] during this retreat, and [[Hanen]] was secured once again.

The rebels eventually retook [[Ka'thoor]], and all attention was turned on [[Tenzentak]]. The city's rough outskirts and defensible position made it for a long drawn out battle. It wasn't until a well trained group of [[Tabaxi]] rebels scaled the cliffs edge in great numbers and broke the outer walls defensed from the inside. In this victory the rebels took south [[Kapesh]] in its entirety. 

## The Founding of The Free Cities of Alderun
After [[Tenzentak]] was taken by rebels, [[Kapesh]] attempted to retake [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Deepspell]], but were unsuccessful. The region was in a state of chaos, but had a hopeful air to it.

Eirmond and representatives from the cities met in [[Rails]] to establish a new government. The [[Alderian Council]] was formed for this purpose. A group of representatives, one from each of the cities, to serve the purpose of maintaining each city, and upholding the laws and values. The region was renamed [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Alderun meaning *hope* in [[Orcish]].

[[Kapesh]] did not recognize them as a kingdom for many years, but eventually caved to political and military pressures.
