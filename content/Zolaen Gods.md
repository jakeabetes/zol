title: "Zolaen Gods"
---The pantheon of [[Gods]] that created [[Zol]] from the [[Sea of Monsters]].

The [[Zolaen Gods]] are a pantheon of gods who closely follow the [[The Watcher in The Door]]. These [[Gods]] seek to create a perfect world envisioned by their supreme leader.

Unfortunately for [[Zol]], not all forces agree with this path. A myriad of conflicting views and passions for [[Zol]] makes for a landscape of challenge and resistance against [[The Watcher in The Door]]'s vision.

Additionally, [[Bethar]], [[Ellyon and Aradon]] of the [[Wayward Gods]] are often associated with the [[Zolaen Gods]]. However scripture does not speak of them as members of the [[Zolaen Gods]], but does speak of their relationship with them. [[Bethar]], [[Ellyon and Aradon]] are often honored in places where the [[Zolaen Gods]] are as well.

## The Goal of the Zolaen Gods
The followers of the [[Zolaen Gods]] believe that their intentions are to make [[Zol]] into a paradise. A long and difficult challenge that requires much faith and sacrifice. The [[Zolaen Gods]] bear the responsibility of making the difficult choices that are required to form this perfect world.

These choices made by [[Zolaen Gods]] occur on a grand scale, involving the lives of many beings, creating a path of creation and destruction that shapes the world of mortals. Sometimes this manifest beautifully, other times it may seem wrathful.

This effort is only made more difficult amongst resistance from other [[Gods]] like those of [[The Void]] or [[The Wandering Gods]] who seek a different horizon.

Skeptics believe that the [[Zolaen Gods]] caused [[The Undoing]] when some discovery amongst mortals caused [[Zol]] to stray too far from their vision. To these individuals, the [[Zolaen Gods]] are unrighteous and should be feared.

## Through the Lens of The Trinity
Those who follow a the Trinity-Centric [[Religion]], believe that the [[Zolaen Gods]] are an extension of [[The Trinity]]. To these individuals see [[Zolaen Gods]] as only one mere facet of the true power that is [[The Trinity]].
