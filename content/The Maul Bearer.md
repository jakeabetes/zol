title: "The Maul Bearer"
---
One of [[The Void]]'s powerful [[Demons]]. [[The Maul Bearer]] is one of the most culturally significant [[Demons]] as he played a role in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. The elves of [[Gethsemane]] struck a deal with him so he and his army would fight the [[Humans]] of [[Kapesh]] on their behalf. Said to be a human sized being with black skin, red eyes, and a crown of horns. He carried a large stone maul that was said to steal the souls of whoever he killed with it.

Both [[The Maul Bearer]] and his army were destroyed. As far as [[Demons]] go, it is thought that he was only moderately powerful. Regardless, his tangible presence in [[Zol]]'s history makes him a house hold name when stories of [[Demons]] are told.
