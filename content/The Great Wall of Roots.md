title: "The Great Wall of Roots"
---The barrier that exists between [[Zol]] and [[The Cosmos]]. It is a nexus of strange, golden, semi-transparent, root like plants. The roots themselves appear as dead, however they are extremely durable. The local area of [[The Cosmos]] held within [[The Great Wall of Roots]] is known as [[The Ethos]].

When looking up at the sky on a clear night, one can see the outline of the translucent roots, and view the shining stars beyond. It is said the the stars are other worlds, just like [[Zol]]. However they are impossibly far away.
