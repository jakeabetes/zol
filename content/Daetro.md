# Daetro
*Wayward God of Fire, Minor Deity*
![[Daetro.png]]

Lord of the flame, [[Daetro]] is the spirit of fire and the molten expanses that exist in [[Zol]]. A benevolent being who's concerns rarely extend outside of it's domain. Academic evidence found in [[The Grand Nothing]] indicates that [[Daetro]] is one half of a greater being that was fractured into two parts. Its other half being [[Eptro]].

## Depiction
A vaguely humanoid shape formed of pure flame, burning cloth, or molten rock. The heat given off from his presence typically destroys the surrounding environment. 

## Symbolism
The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol of fire.

## Behavior
[[Daetro]] is known to be a protective and benevolent being to those who reside in his domain, as long as they follow his rule.

Known to regularly communicate with his followers, [[Daetro]] demands worship and sacrifice in turn for good fortune and protection. Those who take a stance against [[Daetro]]'s rule are cast out or pursued by his envoys.

Despite the similarity in domain, [[Daetro]] has a particular distaste for the [[Church of Three Fires]], and the beliefs around it. It presumed that this is because of a dispute over the ownership of fire.

## Realm
[[Daetro]] resides in [[The Kulpis Desert]]. He moves all about this space, but is known to spend much of his time in [[Mount Zerstel]], the volcano nearest to the oasis city of [[Rockfire]].

## Worshipers
Most of [[Daetro]]'s followers reside in the city of [[Rockfire]]. Worshiping his fire and the gifts he gives. His relationship with the city is almost like that of some great king. He aids in the appointment of rulers and grand decisions. [[Daetro]] is likely the most present god in [[Zol]].

Clergy will seek hermitage on the slope of [[Mount Zerstel]] and congregations will regularly cast sacrifices into the volcano itself.

Some nomadic individuals will travel [[Zol]] spreading the word of [[Daetro]].
