Skimmers are dangerous, but wickedly fast vehicles made by way of [[Iron Light]]. Similar to [[Airships]], these vehicles travel through the air. However, [[Skimmers]] do not hover more than a few feet above the ground. They also require a very uniform terrain to travel across. The only places fit for such forms of travel are [[The Kulpis Desert]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. The far north east of [[The Korus Arctic]] would be ideal for this topographically, however the magic suppressing nature of the environment there renders them useless.

They come in many shapes and sizes, some are fit for transporting many people, while others are fit for a single individual. They are quite expensive, so they are not often seen in use. When they are in use, they occasionally are met with combat, so many of them are armed with defenses.
