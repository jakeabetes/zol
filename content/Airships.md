Wonderous [[Apparatum]] constructed using surprisingly simple [[Iron Light]] principals. Many different types of [[Airships]] have been developed, using many different methods of flight. Some appear as flying ships similar to their nautical cousins, others appear as complex metal spheroids.

These devices are simple in their design, but operation is difficult, dangerous, and requires a skilled crew. While expensive, the creation of [[Airships]] revolutionized [[Zol]].

The fields of exploration and travel were met with an influx of passion and adventure. Commerce was bettered by the speed at which the ships could take valuables. Many jobs were created as crew members, mechanics, or workers at the newly created Airship Docks were needed all over [[Zol]].

While amazing for [[Zol]], the invention of [[Airships]] also introduced problems. Pirates, storms, and warfare all spilled blood when interacting with airships.

[[Airships]] even had new interactions with the [[Gods]]. The [[Wayward Gods]], [[Ellyon and Aradon]], surprisingly took to the sky to watch over aeronautical life as they do with nautical life.
