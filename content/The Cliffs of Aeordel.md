Home to the [[Zolaen Gods]], [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]] is a palace in a plane of its own high above all of [[Zol]]. It is nigh inaccessible to those not bought there by the [[Zolaen Gods]].

[[The Watcher]] created [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. He resides there along with many of his close allies, envoys, angels, and the chosen dead of the [[Zolaen Gods]].
