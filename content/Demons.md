title: "Demons"
---
The unknown horrors of [[The Void]]. A poorly understood cast of monsters and evil beings. They are the descendants, acolytes, or the very beings who defied [[The Watcher in The Door]] when he spun The [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]]. [[Demons]] hate [[Zol]] and seek its destruction. They hope to return [[Zol]] to the once chaotic and deconstructed state of The [[Sea of Monsters]].

[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.
