title: "Woogis"
---*The Quiet Coast*
![[Woogis Skyline.png]]

A small city that feels a world away from the challenges and strife that most of [[Zol]] faces. [[Woogis]] is a peaceful city populated mostly by [[Halflings]]. Nearby cities are separated by long stretches of sea, or The Madreelles. The Madreelles is a relatively tame region of hilly forests and fields. This isolation, in a place lacking in danger has made for a happy, and peaceful community.

## Overview

| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Main Opportunity         | [[Woogis]] is a remote, rural city. It feels distant from the troubles of the world. War, geopolitical crisis, disease and poverty do not grip the city in the manner that much of [[Zol]] is held. It is a peaceful and slow place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Main Challenge           | The city can sometimes feel disconnected, distant, or ignorant of the rest of the world. This disconnection culminates as distrust, but not hatred, towards outsiders. The community seems to shake like a straw hut in a storm at the mention of societal change. The city is lacking in bold individuals, weird creative-types, modernized education, [[Apparatum]], acceptance of magic, and other resources easily found in large urban centers. |
| Climate                  | Temperate/Dry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Group       | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Nobility    | Social Class | The wealthy few of the city. There are only a handful of people within the city who are truly rich. These are typically mine owner, merchants, or those with political station. Their low abundance means that they mingle with the common folk frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Common folk | Social Class | The Vast majority. Farmers, craftspeople, dock workers, fishermen, miners, and things of the like. These people live relatively happy lives as the cost of living is low, and the citizens take care of their own. If someone is unable to provide for themselves they are usually looked after by the community, unless they are unlinked or intentionally drive people away.             |
| Beggars     | Social Class | Those who are without means, and not looked after by the community. They may be addicts, sick, elderly or something of the like. Typically those who are not able to provide for themselves are looked after, but if they intentionally push away help or posses some trait that sparks fear or distrust, they will not receive the help that would be given if they conformed to society. |
| Slaves      | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. In [[Woogis]], slaves are only owned by nobility. They do not receive horrible mistreatment that many slaves do in larger cities. They are more in the category of servants forced into dedication by law. They still follow the regulations that are enforced upon slaves.                          |
| Riff-raff   | Social Class | A term given to non-halfling individuals within the city. These may be troublesome visitors who are referred to by this name in a disdainful manner, or local born citizens who get called the title affectionately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Woogis]] is not very significant. Its name in synonymous with rural, slow life. Some dream of emigrating to the city for its peaceful nature, and those who do find just that, but only that. The city region is lovely and serene, but does not have the resources many cities posses.

## Historical Importance
Modern [[Woogis]] is actually the 3rd iteration of the city. Past conflicts have resulted in the city be razed as its defenses are greatly lacking. One would think that greater defenses would be build, but the attacks on the city were surprisingly low casualty. In response to this destruction, its people just picked up and moved down the coast to rebuild elsewhere. No one put in the effort to build major defenses, and the citizens actually resisted it as it would 'spoil the views'. Near the city, ruins of older parts of [[Woogis]] are not hard to find.

The city is also famously the birthplace of [[King Tatelak II]]. A long time ago some estranged member of his bloodline emigrated to the peaceful city and was nearly forgotten about in the histories. Vigilant scholars followed the bloodline all the way down to the little costal town to discover the ruler.
