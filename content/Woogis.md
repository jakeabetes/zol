title: "Woogis"
---*The Quiet Coast*
![[Woogis Skyline.png]]

A small city that feels a world away from the challenges and strife that most of [[Zol]] faces. [[Woogis]] is a peaceful city populated mostly by [[Halflings]]. Nearby cities are separated by long stretches of sea, or The Madreelles. The Madreelles is a relatively tame region of hilly forests and fields. This isolation, in a place lacking in danger has made for a happy, and peaceful community.

## Overview
| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Main Opportunity         | [[Woogis]] is a remote, rural city. It feels distant from the troubles of the world. War, geopolitical crisis, disease and poverty do not grip the city in the manner that much of [[Zol]] is held. It is a peaceful and slow place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Main Challenge           | The city can sometimes feel disconnected, distant, or ignorant of the rest of the world. This disconnection culminates as distrust, but not hatred, towards outsiders. The community seems to shake like a straw hut in a storm at the mention of societal change. The city is lacking in bold individuals, weird creative-types, modernized education, [[Apparatum]], acceptance of magic, and other resources easily found in large urban centers. |
