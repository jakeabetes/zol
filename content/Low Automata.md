title: "Low Automata"
---[[Iron Light]] and [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] are capable of creating automata that do not posses a true soul like a [[Warforged]] do. These beings are called [[Low Automata]]. They are usually quite simple in their design, as creating a [[Low Automata]] of high complexity is quite challenging. [[Low Automata]] created through [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] are extremely difficult to make in any case, and creating them using [[Iron Light]] often results in [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] if they grow too complex. The latter fact makes creating complex Low Automata nearly impossible due to the risk of the creation being changed or destroyed by [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]].

[[Low Automata]] are advantageous as they are inexpensive, and wholly obedient to their creator based on their specifications during creation.
