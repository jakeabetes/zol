![[Draedon.png]]

The uncontested, He who has unraveled the secrets of [[Arcana]]. Draedon is arguably not a god, but is as powerful as many minor deities. This makes Draedon one of the most interesting beings in all of [[Zol]]. Draedon is a once mortal man who surpassed the skill of any known mage.

He used his abilities to transcend mortality and forges on to new cosmic discoveries.

## Depiction

## Symbolism

## Behavior
Draedon is a reclusive and strange being. His behavior is not well documented, but he is thought to spend much of his time researching the cosmos and creating powerful spells, machines, and other arcane creations.

Some suspect him to be one of the [[Wordbearers]], but in the few times he has made historical appearances in the [[Prime Material Plane]] he has denied this notion.  Claiming that route of ascension to be limiting.

Draedon is known for being uncommunicative and does not share his findings with anyone.

## Realm
Draedon resides in a demiplane of his own creation called [[Elm Manor]].

## Worshipers
Draedon has no record of responding to any form of prayer or things of the sort. Some cults have emerged and died, but they were of no consequence. Because of this, Draedon does not have a following save for the craven academics who fruitlessly seek his knowledge.
