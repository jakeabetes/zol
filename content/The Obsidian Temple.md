![[The Obsidian Temple.png]]

Located within the holy city of [[Rockfire]], [[The Obsidian Temple]] is a strange menagerie of many different religious groups all sharing a single roof. It is a place of both worship and study. It is a school of the [[Observum]], an extension of [[The University]]. It is a massive sprawling temple of black obsidian and sandstone bricks. Within its grounds, many academics, priests, clerics, sages, monks engage in study, debate and worship. All with the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the [[Gods]].

Many think the purist a foolish, impossible, or sinful. However, one cannot deny that in the divide that exists between god and mortal lies the greatest of mysteries. Those who study at [[The Obsidian Temple]] are mostly not users of [[Magic]]. This is because the bond to a greater power required for [[Observance]] is not so easily gained. Most are historians, philosophers, and theologians. These individuals are called miesters. Those who can conduct magic by use of [[Observance]] are called practitioners.

The greatest divides that exist within the school are ones of belief. Many argue about the righteousness of their gods and the missing pieces of [[Zol]]'s history. Education within the school is voluntary. This means one can choose what sermons, classes and lectures they go to. The whole school is funded by The Crown. Food and lodging are supplied by the institution.

[[The Obsidian Temple]] is also located underneath [[Mount Zerstel]], the volcano which is home to the god [[Daetro]]. This close proximity allows for the most tangible interaction with a god anywhere within [[The Three Corners]]. A major resource for the school. However [[Daetro]] is not an open book by any means. There are many records of him answering questions with sentences like "This is a query for mortals to answer on their own".
