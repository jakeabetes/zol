## Overview
[[Pheridian]] belief is often defined by some as an [[Obscuran]] religion. While true by some definitions, [[Pheridian]] belief is one of the larges religious denominations that is not a Zolaen-Centric, or Trinity-Centric belief system. It is based in worship of [[The Oldshards]]. Two ancient and mysterious relics with magical properties like nothing else. [[The Apex]] and [[The Vertex]]. [[Pheridian]] belief sees [[The Oldshards]] as perfect objects. Two things which strike order amongst the chaos of [[Zol]].

The true nature of [[The Oldshards]] is not known, but it is written in [[Pheridian]] scripture that they were once understood by Pre-Undoing [[Changelings]]. [[Pheridian]] belief idealizes the concept of rediscovering [[The Oldshards]]. Only through this understanding can order be made of a chaotic world.

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
[[Pheridian]] scripture believes that [[Goh'zul]], while destructive and terrible, was a collector of great things. He would scour the cosmos, accumulating pieces of the universe within himself. These things swirled within his infinite form. Together they blended and merged into a wonderous, and chaotic mess. The world of [[Zol]]. This interaction within [[Goh'zul]]'s body killed him, but [[Zol]] grew from his remains.

[[Goh'zul]] collected many things. Forces, [[Gods]], and objects of immense power. Each one a marvel in its own right. However, only 2 objects stood out as perfect. [[The Oldshards]].

### Ancient Society
[[Pheridian]] scripture tells of ancient people being advanced and peaceful. [[Pheridian]] belief rejects the theory of the [[Triumvirate]]. It is thought that ancient [[Changelings]] had a comprehensive understanding of [[The Oldshards]] before [[The Undoing]].

### The Undoing
[[Pheridian]] scripture does not give a cause for [[The Undoing]]. It actually claims that attempting to infer that information is heretical. It instead believes that the true cause of [[The Undoing]] is information that is actually stored within [[The Oldshards]]. It is only to be known when that information is dispensed by them.

## Church Structure
The church within [[Pheridian]] belief are unique as they also serve as places of education. It is an organization known as [[The Eelynn]]. Leading these organizations is handled by **Shardwitnesses**. **Shardwitnesses** are much more than just clergy within [[The Glassius Reach]], as they are also scholars, politicians, tacticians, and things of the like. However, some **Shardwitnesses** bear the responsibility of leading their people in faith. They do bear a hierarchy within [[The Eelynn]], however there are not titles associated with rank. All leaders are simply known as **Shardwitnesses**, but rank is a carefully determined structure done based on the individuals within the organization.

Each Glassian city has its own manifestation of [[The Eelynn]], with its own organizational structure.

## Followers
### Modernist
Modernist belief focuses on the idea living ones life in an orderly way. Each person's life has its own unique shape and the process of strengthening one's faith involves finding how that shape fits into [[The Pattern]]. Modernist belief sees [[The Pattern]] as more of a suggestion rather than a set of distinct rules.

### Fundamentalist
Fundamentalist belief consists of very strict adherence to [[The Pattern]]. It is believed by these individuals that more information about [[The Oldshards]] can only be found through devotion to [[The Pattern]]. Straying from [[The Pattern]] is a sin in the eyes of a Fundamentalist.
