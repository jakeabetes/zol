title: "The Narrow Sea"
---![[The Narrow Sea.png]]

The smallest of the seas, and most familiar with [[The Three Corners]]' history of warfare. [[The Narrow Sea]] is the thin border between [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]]. The two kingdoms fought a war that waged on for ages called the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. The sea floor is littered with sunken ships and the bones of those lost in the fighting.

Its far northern parts are on the coasts of [[The Glassius Reach]], however the waters near Zhal are extremely treacherous. Making consistent travel near the widening of the sea very dangerous, and infrequently done.

## Climate
The sea is thin from east to west, but tall from north to south. This makes it experience a wide range of weather patterns based on how north one finds themselves. It varies from frigid waters in the north to borderline tropical in the south.

## History and Inhabitants
Most well know for being the naval battleground during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. It is also home to the city of [[Riverbridge]]. This specific city and its island were a frequently contested territory in the battles.

## Inhabitants
The people of [[Riverbridge]].

## Borders
The sea has coasts on [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]], and [[The Glassius Reach]]. Its waters give way to [[The Korus Arctic]] where The Glassmounts eventually freeze over its surface entirely for as far as they eye can see. It gives way to [[The Archsea]] south of [[Kierketholl]].
