title: "Giants"
---Obscure and rare beings of [[Zol]]. There are very few [[Giants]] within the world, but archeologists have discovered evidence of ancient civilizations of the peculiar beings. Giants appear as very large humanoid like beings, and posses an innate connection to the natural world. There are many types of giants, but little is known about them. Some think them to be the ancient people of where [[The Three Corners]] now stands, other think them to be mere monsters.

Those who encounter giants tell stories that paint a diverse species. Some are very simple minded, and brutish. Like the two headed Ettin. Others are highly intelligent and posses an affinity for magic like the Fire Giants of [[The Underdark]].

No one knows what made [[Giants]] fall from their former glory, but they can now be seen in the hidden corners of [[Zol]]. An undeniable forlorn air follows them wherever they go.
