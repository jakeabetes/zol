title: "Great Magic"
---Great magic is a un-proven belief held by a large group of people in [[Zol]]. It was thought that before [[The Undoing]] that [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] all possessed a power called [[Great Magic]]. A supposed innate connection to all the wills, granting a very high degree of innate magical ability. Additionally it was thought to grant a long lifespan.

After [[The Undoing]], it is thought that [[Humans]] had their [[Great Magic]] taken from them. This power was them broken down into pieces which were formed into the [[Off-Human]] races. The loss of memory from [[The Undoing]] is responsible for [[The Triumvirate]] no longer being able to harness their innate magical gifts.

## Origin of the theory
Original speculation came from archeological finds in [[The Grand Nothing]]. Artifacts from these finds never mention any race other than those of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. Biographical content in these artifacts tells of these races all sharing centauries long lifespans.

These causes for very polarized beliefs amongst the races of [[Zol]]. Especially when paired with modern history, beliefs, and cultures. However these beliefs are only held by a percentage of the population.

## Social Issues
Due to this theory, many believe their race is superior to other. Causing discrimination, racism, war and slavery. Many [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] think they are better than [[Humans]], and [[Off-Human]] [[Races]]. Then there are [[Humans]] who think they have dominion over the [[Off-Human]] races as their progenitor. Those who suffer most are the [[Off-Human]] races pushed into slavery, or those like [[Changelings]], who are banished to the edge of [[The Three Corners]].

[[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] have historically blamed [[Humans]] for everything. Many members of the two races who are said to still bear [[Great Magic]] believe it is their mission to relearn the old ways of [[Magic]], and gain their lost art.

## Evidence Against Great Magic
Many adopt the belief of grand magic to support their bias. However just as many, if not more disagree.

The issue of longevity could be explained by the advancement of technology created by society in [[The Before]]. Meaning [[Humans]] were only able to live as long as other races due to medicine and [[Magic]]. 

The origin of the [[Off-Human]] races remains a mystery, but most argue that the origin of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] is unknown as well. The fact that their history is know back further does not prove anything to the origin of the other races. Other [[Races]] like [[Fairies]], and [[Lunite]] do not have a known origin. New races have even come to be such as [[Kenku]] and [[Warforged]]. This indicates that [[Zol]] is likely not limited to [[The Triumvirate]], and it probably never was.
