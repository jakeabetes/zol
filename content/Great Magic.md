# Great Magic
Great magic is a un-proven belief held by a large group of people in [[Zol]]. It was thought that before [[The Undoing]] that [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] all possessed a power called [[Great Magic]]. A supposed innate connection to all the wills, granting a very high degree of innate magical ability. Additionally it was thought to grant a long lifespan.

After [[The Undoing]], it is thought that [[Humans]] had their [[Great Magic]] taken from them. This power was them broken down into pieces which were formed into the [[Off-Human]] races.

## Origin of the theory
Original speculation came from archeological finds in [[The Grand Nothing]]. Artifacts from these finds never mention any race other than those of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. Biographical content in these artifacts tells of these races all sharing centauries long lifespans.

These causes for very polarized beliefs amongst the races of [[Zol]]. Especially when paired with modern history, beliefs, and cultures. However these beliefs are only held by a percentage of the population.

## Social Issues
Due to this theory, many believe their race is superiors to another. Cause discrimination, racism, war and slavery. Elves and Dwarves who think they are better than Humans. Humans who think they have dominion over the [[Off-Human]] races as their progenitor. Even [[Off-Human]] races like [[Changelings]] who are banished to the edges of [[Zol]] for having the worst traits of Humans. 

## Evidence Against Great Magic
Many adopt the belief of grand magic to support their bias. However just as many, if not more disagree.

The issue of longevity could be explained by the advancement of technology created by society in [[The Before]]. Meaning [[Humans]] were only able to live as long as other races due to medicine and [[magic]]. 

The origin of the [[Off-Human]] races remains a mystery, but most argue that the origin of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] is unknown as well. The fact that their history is know back further does not prove anything to the origin of the other races.
