title: "Apparatum"
---A word for devices made by [[Iron Light]]. These devices can be quite simple or very complex. Their value scales with complexity, and distance from locations where their production is common place (ex: [[Deepspell]]).

## Common Apparatum

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| Span Read | A set of 2 devices, each with a writing surface and an arm to support a writing utensil. Individuals can send messages over a great distance by writing on one surface, causing its counterpart to automatically make the same movements. It is crucial both implements are level so movements are transmitted accurately. This means that span reads do not operate well in the sea or sky unless gyroscopic mechanisms are included in their design. Devices are connected to each other via signets. Simple span reads have a single hard-set partner signet, while the more intricate ones have swappable signets or ones that can be configured to fit the user's needs. Many who utilize span reads will do so through a third party operator (usually a business) that will ensure their message reaches the intended target, assuming their recipient is included within their extensive archives of contacts.|
| Iceless | A sealed box with an iron rod that moves heat along it from the inside of the box to the outside to preserve foods within. A heatsink attached to the outside of the box is connected to a mechanism that requires regular winding (usually daily) to properly distribute heat. The device also requires an operator be near by bearing a corresponding signet ring.|
| Light Lock | A magical lock that only works with specific individual keys rather than any key that fits the correct pattern. Making forced entry very difficult. |
| Illusion Lamp | A magical lamp that utilizes illusion light. Eliminates the need for fuel and fire hazards. Requires a being possessing [[Vizir]] to be within a relatively small range (around 100ft) for operation. |
| Ever-sharp Steel | Blade edges that resist becoming dull. |
| Ever-hard Steel | Metal that can withstand more damage than it should be able to. |
| Burn Filter | A small devices that evaporates water and reconsolidates it into filtered, drinkable water. These devices are known to have short lifespans. They are cheap to produce in a disposable manner, and especially hard to produce a lasting version|
| Vizir Alarm | A device that makes sounds when a being with a [[Vizir]] enters within its small radius |
| Iron Lighter | A device that produces a small temporary flame without the need of an internal fuel source |
| Twinned Bells | A set of small bells that all toll when any of the set are rung |
| Chronomantic Clock | A time telling device that leverages the simplest properties of [[Chronomancy]] for its function. |
| Compass | A device that can be programmed to point north, or at a specific point in space given the device was originally activated at that location. |

## Complex Apparatum

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| Sending Stone | Devices that have the capability of transmitting voice messages to other sending stones over great distances. Operating similarly to Span Reads, but transmitting sound rather than pen strokes. These devices also require signets in their implementation. |
| Holdings | Containers that are larger on the inside than the outside, allowing for great storage |
| Automail | Prosthetic limbs that give sense of touch, and sometimes abilities greater than that of its biological counterpart |
| [[Warforged]] | A race of beings formed from [[Iron Light]]. These individuals can be made to very specific specifications to excel at specific tasks. In modern day, these individuals are constructed to be servile. |
| Archival Index | A terminal device that can be used to index information within a library for easy retrieval. These devices are extremely expensive, and difficult to up-keep. Less than 15 are used across [[The Three Corners]]. |
| Spacial Engines | Devices that can convert empty space into motion. The method of motion used in [[Trains]] and [[Airships]]. These devices are known to create extremely low temperatures so they typically use coal heat to prevent ice crystals (which could damage the ferric runes) from forming. |
| Mass Reducers | Devices that are integrated into the whole of greater Apparatum to reduce their overall mass. Used in [[Airships]]. |
| Firearms | A classification of projectile weaponry that leverages [[Iron Light]] for destructive capabilities. These devices can launch many types of ammunition depending on how they are made. In most hands these are far more efficient than bows or crossbows, but are expensive to acquire and maintain. In modern times a non-magical equivalent that uses black powder has been used widely, but these are not nearly as effective as Iron Light Guns. |
