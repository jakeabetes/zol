title: "Absurdia"
---*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Arguably the weirdest place in all of [[Zol]]. [[Absurdia]] exists as an almost parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is unknown exactly what made [[Absurdia]], which only deepens the strangeness of the realm.

[[Absurdia]] is filled with whacky cities and strange individuals. The population native to [[Absurdia]] are known as the Absurd. They all seem to have an air about them that makes them feel like characters from a book.

Quests, squabbles, feuds, parties, monster attacks, festivals, battles, and prophecies emerge on the daily within the odd realm. To the locals, the constant bombardment of events is entirely normal and no one seems to tire of it.

[[Absurdia]] seems to contain many cities, all of which refer to themselves as *"Absurdia"*. Any other city is referred to as *"The Enemy"*. 

Many travel to [[Absurdia]] to see its strange wonders, and some even make a home there.

## Death in Absurdia
[[Absurdia]] is not on [[The Mortal Coil]]. When a being native to [[Absurdia]] dies, they typically reappear after a week or two with no memory of the event. It is considered impolite to talk about the fact someone has died to their face. 

If one is not native to [[Absurdia]], they are usually banished from the plane and sent to some random location. Typically  on the [[Prime Material Plane]], but there has been record of people ending up as far as [[The Moons]]. Due to its chaotic nature, death in [[Absurdia]] not  uncommon.
