title: "Absurdia"
---
*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Arguably the weirdest place in all of [[Zol]]. Many believe it is not even a real place, other's think it is the manifestation of some strange magic, or the will of a mischievous god.[[Absurdia]] exists as an almost *parody* of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is unknown exactly what made [[Absurdia]], which only deepens the strangeness of the realm.

[[Absurdia]] is filled with whacky cities and strange individuals. The population native to [[Absurdia]] are known as the Absurd. They all seem to have an air about them that makes them feel like characters from a book.

Quests, squabbles, feuds, parties, monster attacks, festivals, battles, and prophecies emerge on the daily within the odd realm. To the locals, the constant bombardment of events is entirely normal and no one seems to tire of it.

[[Absurdia]] seems to contain many cities, all of which have very strange names like *Yorfinshire*, *Boogsley*, or *Gumpins*. Each city seems to have a stark rivalry with all other cities. It is not known how many cities exist, or how large the plane is. Many travel to [[Absurdia]] to see its strange wonders, and some even make a home there. 

The few stories and texts that exist about it tell of wonderful adventures, and strange characters. However there does seem to be something *wrong* with the plane, a strange darkness that lies at its center which none of its residents will acknowledge.

## Death in Absurdia
[[Absurdia]] is not on [[The Mortal Coil]]. When a being native to [[Absurdia]] dies, they occasionally reappear after a short period of time that can be as short as one hour, or maybe as long as two weeks. When they return, they have no memory of their death, or the events leading up to it. To the Absurd, it is considered impolite to talk about the fact someone has died to their face. 

If one is not native to [[Absurdia]], they are usually banished from the plane and sent to some random location on another plane. The few records of this tell of individuals being sent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], but there has been records of people ending up as far as [[The Moons]]. Due to its chaotic nature, death in [[Absurdia]] not  uncommon.
