# The Mortal Coil
The force that bonds a soul to a vessel, and disjoins them upon death.

[[The Mortal Coil]] is a primal force that exists in [[Zol]], it is what causes things to live and die. Some think it is an effect of the way [[The First Tongue]] bound the [[Sea of Monsters]], making it part of [[The Trinity]]. Others think it is a force of its own.

[[The Mortal Coil]] is maintained by [[The Coilwalker]]. Some think that he is its reason for its existence, others think him to be an avatar of its greater will. Regardless of what controls [[The Mortal Coil]], its power effects every being in [[Zol]], living or dead.

## The Rules of The Mortal Coil
[[The Mortal Coil]] is bound to a specific set of rules that determine the function of life and death across all [[Planes]] of [[Zol]].
- Beforelife
	- little is known of the Beforelife, but it is thought that souls grow freely from [[nodes]] in [[The Ethos]]. These souls are selected at random by [[The Mortal Coil]] to be bound to vessels. This binding begins Life.
	- Souls in this state are thought to be non-sentient, and only become true beings when they are bound to a vessel.
		- This is not the case for souls that are sent for rebirth after death. In this scenario, the souls-to-be-reborn are considered comatose, living beings. 
- Life
	- Life begins when a vessel is fully created and a soul is bound to it. This can manifest in a number of ways
		- Successfully completed reproduction
			- A soul is only attached when a reproductive creature fully forms a child that successfully hatches, or is birthed
		- Homunculum
			- The creation of an artificial vessel fit enough for a soul to enter it
			- This can manifest in many ways
				- A clone of a being is made via magic
				- elemental forces are bent to house a soul
				- Mechanicum Immaculatum
					- A newly discovered method of creating life where a complex enough creation of [[Iron Light]] is made and it becomes sentient.
						- This is how beings like [[Warforged]] come to life
		- Divine Creation
			- When one of the [[Gods]] directly uses their power to create a vessel and injects a soul into it
		- Natural Spawn
			- When the natural world of [[Zol]] produces a being on its own
	- Life cannot begin on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, except for the case of Divine Creation where a powerful enough god manually seeks out a soul for the vessel.
- Death
	- Death occurs when enough damage afflicts the system that maintains life. This can appear as
		- Damage to the vessel so great it cannot sustain a soul
		- Damage to the bond between a vessel and soul so great it causes them to separate
		- Damage to the soul so great it destroys the soul
			- This is the rarest death, as the soul is nigh indestructible
	- If Death does occur, there are cases where magic can be used to restore life, given that the circumstances are correct.
		- If one does successfully restore life, the being will return with a scar from [[The Mortal Coil]] called a Mortality Rune ![[Mortality Runes.png]]
	- Death cannot occur on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present. A dead being is usually banished to [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]], or the [[Prime Material Plane]] on the brink of death. This is not always the case as some planes like [[Absurdia]] have their own rules about death off [[The Mortal Coil]].
		- Any living thing can die so long as it is under the effect of [[The Mortal Coil]]
		- Something that is defined as *Immortal* is not killed by old age, and can withstand colossal amounts of trauma to their vessel, soul, and the bond between them without succumbing to death.
		- This principal is why the [[Gods]] spend most of their time outside of [[The Mortal Coil]], as it gives them much security from other powerful beings who would see them dead.
- Afterlife
	- When death occurs, the soul (if intact) leaves the vessel. It is then guided by [[The Coilwalker]] to a new phase of existence based on the way the soul acted in its lifetime.
	- The paths a soul can take are:
		- Rest
			- If one of the [[Gods]] takes a liking to a given soul, the may be brought to stay with them outside [[The Mortal Coil]]. A peaceful eternity amongst kindred spirits.
			- If no god claims it, and the soul is unfit for rebirth or punishment. It is sent to [[Apolyatum]].
		- Rebirth
			- Beings who undergo rebirth are sent back into [[The Ethos]] for their soul to be randomly selected for life again. If this occurs they are reborn with small slivers of their past lives interwoven into their being.
			- Slivers of past lives stay with souls, but are largely born without an sense of past life.
				- [[Magic]] investigation can expose truths about past lives.
			- Many things can spark rebirth. Magical influence, the will of a god, or even if the soul itself truly seeks it.
			- Beings who undergo rebirth many times often go on to do great things.
		- [[Limbo]]
			- If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul, they are sent to limbo to undergo some trial.
				- Each trial varies for each soul
				- Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution
				- The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death
		- Punishment
			- If a soul has led a dark life, [[The Coilwalker]] brings it to [[Damnation]] upon death.
			- It is thought that [[The Coilwalker]] struck an accord with [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. This deal allows for [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] to claim some form of power from the deaths of [[Zol]]. In exchange he is to carry out the punishment for souls marked by [[The Coilwalker]].
			- Punishment varies in severity. Sometimes it is a light and temporary punishment like manual labor for a few hundred years. After which the damned are allowed to reside in [[Apolyatum]], the highest layer of [[Damnation]], the city of the dead.
				- Other times it is a more severe, and eternal punishment
		- [[Obliteration]]
			- If a soul is deemed too dangerous for [[Zol]], [[The Coilwalker]] will send a soul to the lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. A small and dark place called [[Obliteration]]. Here, giant beings made from obsidian destroy the souls sent to them with mighty hammers forged by Aldem himself.

## Anti-Life
Occasionally a vessel will exist without a soul, but the vessel will continue to function in a strange manner akin to Life. There are likely many things that can cause this, but few are known:
- [[Magical Backfire]]
- The will of one of the [[Gods]]
- [[Necromancy]]

The resulting being is a vessel who acts in one of two ways
- Echoes
	- This occurs when a vessel survives having its soul severed, and no further will is imposed on it beyond the initial severing
	- The resulting being will attempt to continue their "life", but they do so without all of their emotions or memories in tact, resulting in strange behavior. Sometimes the physical vessel will also become monstrous in appearance.
	- Anti-life is reversible for Echoes if a soul can be rebound to its vessel, returning the being to normal Life again.
- Undead
	- Vessels who have fully died, then given an artificial soul fabricated via [[Necromancy]].
	- This creates a being subservient to the will of its souls creator
	- The strength of the resulting being is dependent on the state of the vessel, and the skill of the souls creator.
	- These beings are typically more susceptible to further deaths as the bond between vessel and soul is not perfect.
		- But the severed artificial soul can be easily reattached and sometimes do so on its own.

Beings who experience Anti-Life are immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]] as they do not age and have greatly increased fortitude in many cases. A [[Lich]] is a being who does this to themselves intentionally, usually to gain immortality and pursue the dark side of [[Arcana]].


## The Mortal Realms
[[Zol]] has many [[Planes]] of existence that are all anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[The Mortal Coil]]'s influence does not exist in all [[Planes]]. This has an interesting effect on the behavior of life, death, and gods on any plane.

The [[Planes]] that contain [[The Mortal Coil]] are known as The Mortal Realms:
- The [[Prime Material Plane]]
- The [[Fey]]
- The [[Fell]]
- [[The Ethos]]
- [[The Elemental Planes]]

Due to this fact, most [[Gods]] rarely enter these [[Planes]] themselves. When they do, they put their life at great risk.
