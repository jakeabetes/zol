*The City of the High Elves*
![[Xerul 3.png]]

The elegant city of [[Xerul]] rests in the center of [[Gethsemane]]. Populated by the proud High Elves, the city is ancient, and resplendent. Surrounded by the lush forest of Yan Nalora, the city is harmonious with the local nature. Its citizens carry a deep love and respect for both their city, and territory. It is one of the many cities within [[Gethsemane]] that is very hard for outsiders to reach, as [[The Iron Tracks]] do not contain it within its routes. Because of this, [[Xerul]] is almost mythical to common folk of the other kingdoms.

| Main Opportunity         | The city is comparable to a grand work of art, comprised over millennia by the many dedicated hands of [[Elves]]. A sort of utopia for its people. Everything has been designed and thought out to the greatest detail. Citizens spend their whole lives honing a single skill to a level of mastery that surpasses most anything seen across [[The Three Corners]]. Those who fit into the social structure of the city, have some of the highest quality-of-living in all of [[Zol]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Main Challenge           | To maintain such a perfect utopian city, many rules have to be implemented at every level. Religious regulations, cultural rules, and judicial laws are placed all throughout the city's society. Actual laws are enforced by the city's leadership, but the vast majority of restrictions placed upon an individual come from the general populace. One may face serious consequences if they are known for noisy disruptions, rude behavior, disrespect of nature, and things of the like. Citizens can exercise the Right of Zsar Daeum, a legal process where a group of 15 or more citizens can call a legal trial for poor behavior of another citizen. If found guilty, the punishment may involve things as light as a public apology, or as grave as banishment from the city. While this right is rarely exercised upon neighbors, its existence shapes the behavior of its citizens. However the law has special implications for outsiders, where the right can be exercised by as few as 3 citizens and usually has graver consequences. |

A Maer is an elven title given to those who reach the highest political rank. A Maer is only removed from this position when they die or are overthrown. A new Maer is decided by the High Court, and must have been a member of the High Court at one point in their lives.

The city has effectively no crime, save for the occasional thief who comes to the city attempting to steal something of value.

[[Xerul]]'s military is of medium size, but is extremely effective. They are armed with the highest quality of equipment for their rank, and are remarkably well trained.

## Modern Importance
[[Xerul]] is viewed as a grand, ancient, and fierce city by those from outside of [[Gethsemane]]. Many commoners would see it as a place of pure myth, if it weren't for their historical influence.

Known for their export of extremely fine goods, powerful military, and xenophobia. 

## Historical Importance
The city is central to [[Gethsemane]]'s history, especially in terms of warfare. Its prominence in histories and stories makes it almost seem like the capital of [[Gethsemane]], however the region has no such station.

## Other Things of Note
- [[Xerul]] is not fond of outsiders, but is especially cold to [[Humans]].
