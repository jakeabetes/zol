## Description
[[Firbolgs]] are known to be generally agreeable people. They have a reputation of leading slow, peaceful lives. However they have historically resisted any attempts to push them around.

They are of medium build and significant height, but bear large horns and wide noses. Some say they have a 'bovine' disposition.
