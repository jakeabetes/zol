title: "Conjuration"
---[[Conjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves folding space for the purposes of teleportation, or bringing creatures and objects to, or away from a [[Caster]]. These usages of magic can span great distances, or even cross borders between [[Planes]]. It requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.

Users of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying. Evidence shows this to be some product of [[The Mortal Coil]], but scholars frequently debate this.

## Teleportation
Teleportation is an extremely valuable skill to the society of [[Zol]]. It costs a great amount of gold to hire a [[Caster]] for teleportation. Teleportation is the fastest method to move about [[Zol]], but it does pose a unique set of risks.

Before [[The Iron Tracks]], teleportation was the only consistent and safe way to get from once city to another. Making it only accessible to the rich or powerful [[Caster]]s. Maximum teleportation distance is determined by skill, most who are capable of it can move themselves anywhere within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. 

This limit on teleportation does make it ineffective for long distance expeditions into places like [[The Vast Sea]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. One may argue that you could teleport very far, rest, then teleport again. This strategy however is unfortunately ineffective.

Teleportation is based on familiarity of the current location, and the destination. The less familiar you are with either of these, the more dangerous the operation. If you are intending of teleporting one thousand miles east, you may end up one thousand feet into solid ground if you are not careful.

There are methods of mitigating and even completely removing these risks of teleportation. [[Teleportation Circles]] can be constructed and used as origin points or destinations when travelling. These circles take a long time to create. They are highly commodified pillars in society, and well guarded by their owners. They are commonly referred to as Convergences.

## Dangers of Teleportation
As mentioned, one may end up teleporting to somewhere they do not intend if they are unskilled, or unfamiliar with the destination. However, the risks of teleportation do not end there. It is possible for others to tamper with an individuals teleportation attempt. An individual skilled with [[Divination]] can usually tell information about where a person has teleported from, or where they went.

Some dangerous [[Caster]]s can even lay traps called *Mage Snares* that can change a teleportation's destination without the original caster knowing. This makes teleportation very dangerous for high profile individuals.
