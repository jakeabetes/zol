title: "Conjuration"
---[[Conjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves folding space for the purposes of teleportation, or bringing creatures and objects to, or away from a [[Caster]]. These usages of magic can span great distances [[Planes]] or even cross into other [[Planes]] given the skill of the user.

It requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.

Users of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying.

## Teleportation
Teleportation is an extremely valuable skill to the society of [[Zol]]. Costing great deals of [[Gold]], teleportation is the safest and fastest method to move about [[Zol]].

Before [[The Iron Tracks]], teleportation was the only consistent and safe way to get from once city to another. Making it only accessible to the rich or powerful [[Caster]]s.

Teleportation distance is determined by skill, most who are capable of it can move themselves anywhere within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. 

This limit on teleportation does make it ineffective for long distance expeditions into places like [[The Vast Sea]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. One may argue that you could teleport very far, rest, then teleport again. This strategy however is unfortunately ineffective.

Teleportation is based on familiarity of the current location, and the destination. The less familiar you are with either of these, the more dangerous the operation. If you are intending of teleporting one thousand miles east, you may end up one thousand feet into solid ground.

There are methods of mitigating and even completely removing these risks of teleportation. [[Teleportation Circles]] can be constructed and used as origin points or destinations when travelling. These circles take a long time to create. They are highly commodified pillars in society, and well guarded by their owners.
