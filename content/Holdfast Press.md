[[Holdfast Press]] is a business which distributes a relatively new form of media within [[The Three Corners]], a newspaper. A sheet which contains all of the major goings-on within the city of [[Reach Run]] and the greater world. Its contents are researched and written by a team of journalists. The paper is owned and led by a Jei'di Glassturner. A Fire Genasi with [[Sylf]] known as Loos.

The paper is published and distributed on a weekly cadence. It often faces scrutiny and resistance from the ruling powers of [[Reach Run]] and [[Laenwalde]] as a whole. However the paper has persisted. It continues to publish stories and information important to the common person. It is openly critical of the ruling class, and any corruption its journalists uncover.
