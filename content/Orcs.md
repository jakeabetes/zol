## Description
The history of [[Orcs]] paint a picture of fearsome strength, and wise philosophies. Their culture was at the epicenter of the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. This event led to two polarized movements. The first is an orcish sub-culture of devoted, respectful, and dutiful servants. The other is a movement of proud, defiant warriors. This dynamic paints the [[Orcs]] as a very unique people in [[Zol]]'s history.

[[Orcs]] are of naturally strong physique, and occasionally have tusks or horns. They have long pointed ears and skin that varies uniquely in color and pattern, but is most often green, purple, or grey.
