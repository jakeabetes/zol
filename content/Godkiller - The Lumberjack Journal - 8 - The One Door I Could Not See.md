How could they?

I wander on bloody feet.

My body aches. Weeks without rest. Without pause. My mind has finally begun to drift back together.

I've found the pattern, and it has left my mind broken.

The one door I could not see.

Even my words look wrong, like I’ve forgotten how to write. Forgotten what it is to write.

I have killed the untruth of self, that poor creature.

They swim within me now, all who I have ever been, just below the surface.

We are parallels, The Wretch and I.

He and his brother.

Me and mine.

And I refuse to take part in any of their games. 

I have torn the stone from the stomach of my beast. 

A terrible weapon, one which truly clouds Domain.

Despite his temptations, I will not employ it. Nor will I see it given to capable hands. 

I have cast it aside. Where it lays, I do not know.

I do not care.

This is all so far from over, but I am a piece of it no more.
