## Overview
[[Zephyrean]] belief is often defined by some as an [[Obscuran]] religion. While true by some definitions, [[Zephyrean]] belief is one of the larges religious denominations that is not a Zolaen-Centric, or Trinity-Centric belief system. It is based in worship of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] and the [[Greatwinds]] of the north-eastern kingdom of [[The Ward]].

[[Zephyrean]] belief focuses on the idea that there are great dangers within [[Zol]]. Only through strength, honor, and unity can they be overcome. You can only grow through challenge.

The [[Zephyrean]] religion formed largely in isolation, making its lore and traditions quite different from the dominant religions of [[The Three Corners]] like [[Arkian]] belief or [[Trinaism]].

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
[[Zephyrean]] scripture describes the [[Sea of Monsters]] as a world of endless, angry wind. An infinite sky filled with horrible monsters. [[Adrathar]] came and stilled this sky. He fought along side the other warrior [[Gods]] like [[The Watcher]] and his pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]] against the darkness of the early world. In their victory, they founded [[Zol]].

### Ancient Society
[[Zephyrean]] scripture describes the old world as something vast, beautiful, and strange. The great warriors of old fought of every beast and enemy the [[Gods]] had. They lived in peace for many ages. Then a great, unnamed darkness came. It was so terrible that it tore the world into pieces. The people of the old world had been living in peace for so long they forgot how to fight. Only [[Adrathar]]'s people remembered the warrior's ways. Though their strength wasn't enough. This weakness cost [[Zol]] everything.

### The Undoing
[[Zephyrean]] lore tells of a horrible war against a strange and ancient darkness, it drove the [[Gods]] apart. [[The Watcher]] and his [[Zolaen Gods]] decided to burn the old world down, and build it anew to drive away the darkness. [[The Undoing]]. [[Adrathar]] did not condone [[The Watcher]]'s actions, but he did not condemn him. However, this drove a wedge between the two gods.

## Church Structure
The [[Zephyrean]] church has a very important role in [[The Ward]]'s culture. Church's do not have an interconnected hierarchy amongst them. They are instead usually organized by their local region. Each town, neighborhood, or district having its own church.

Churches are ran by an **Aeostraemos**, a position similar to a high priest. Sometimes the title is shortened to **Aeo**. Beneath them may have a few various **Priests** aiding them in the organization of their church.
