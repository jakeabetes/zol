## Modern Importance
In modern day, it is the staple of [[The Ward]]. It is the largest city, and most of the regions exports that are sent to foreign kingdoms come from it.

## Historical Importance
During [[The Dragon War]], Fike was the stage for the final weeks of the war. Most of [[The Ward]]'s cities had been destroyed. Of the remaining three, it was the only city with the farmland to sustain the kingdom. If its infrastructure were lost, it would spell doom for [[The Ward]]. All those who fought under [[The North Honor]] gave their all to protect it.

## Other Things of Note
- Many call [[Fike]] the Driftwood city. This is because the ocean currents carry storm-thrown driftwood from The Storm Isles to its shores in great piles.
