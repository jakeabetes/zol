---*The Adaptable, Ambitious, and Assiduous. The bearers of the great sin*

## Description
Humans are known for their variety, and fervor. Many joke that they weave themselves into any crack and crevice in civilization. Reality itself could seek their destruction, but they would somehow slip through. Some think this is a virtue, while others believe their persistence is pest-like. The latter opinion is usually held by those who subscribe to the theory of [[The Triumvirate]], [[Great Magic]], and [[The Undoing]].

The lore behind the theory of [[The Triumvirate]] says that [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Humans]] were once the only races that walked [[Zol]]. Their society, technology, and magic was so far advanced beyond anything that exists today. Theories based on archeological finds, religious belief, and inferences made by academics paint a picture of [[Humans]] taking some action that incurred the wrath of the [[Zolaen Gods]], sparked [[The Undoing]], and had their [[Great Magic]] revoked and fractured into the [[Off-Human]] races.
