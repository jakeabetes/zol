# Rails
*The City of Trains*
![[rails 1.png]]

Rails is the birthplace of [[The Great Tracks]], and the largest producer of [[Trains]] in all of [[Zol]].  Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the city is built from striking red brick and mortar. There are dozens of different manufactures for all things train within Rails. Metal forgers, [[Iron Light]] [[Artificers]], lumber craftsmen, textile workers, glass makers, and merchants are a dime a dozen in Rails. This makes for cut throat competition.

What would appear as a quaint, busybody town to an outsider, is known as a devious and plotting economy to the locals. Underselling, and outsourcing, and insider trading are what  fills the day in Rails. While deception, sabotage, and even assassination is what plagues its nights.

Rails is also one of the few cities that have the Great Tracks running directly through the cities center.
