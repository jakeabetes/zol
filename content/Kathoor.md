*Trade, culture, pride, and humility*
![[kathoor skyline.png]]

Ka'thoor, the Orcish City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and known for its eclectic citizens, spicy food, dominant population of [[Orcs]], and unique architecture that incorporates the bones of large beasts. Ka'thoor rests on the border of [[Kapesh]], and is nestled into the mountains. It is a common stop for any who leave or enter [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].

Ka'thoor was once a hub of slave trade during the [[First Age]], and was the first of the now free cities to begin the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. In its victory, Ka'thoor has created a proud, but largely welcoming culture. They keep their history in everything they do to remain a beacon to all of [[Zol]].

Ka'thoor is now a hub of trade related to rare foods, materials, collectables, and art. This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor. As well as [[Kapesh]] merchants who seek the rare goods sold within the city.

Due to its oppressive history, the city does not have nobility. Its leaders are required to live humble lives. In fact many of the people of the city do what they can to maintain humility. One of the ways this is expressed is by doing favors for one another. Many members of the city's population wear unique earrings, called [[Humbelons]], that advertise favors and skills they wish to offer to those in need. These may indicate a wish to give food, housing, repair, and even academic or religious teachings. These earring have become almost a symbol of status, where one is seen as more high standing the wider the variety of earrings they wear. It has gone to the point where this is almost a problem that serves the opposite of what it is trying to achieve, as some wear a ridiculous amount of earrings to appear greatly (and falsely) humble for the status.

Along side those who bear [[Humbelons]], there is an almost opposite group of those who are very proud. These individuals focus on strength, merit, and honor. This section of the populace refer to themselves as Bloodkeepers. Their maxim is one of combat and honor. The prideful Bloodkeepers see themselves as those who preserve the fury and strength that began the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. 

These two groups live unharmoniously. Bloodkeepers see the humble members of society as weak, and that they uphold a modern version of the oppression the people once faced. The humble citizens see the Bloodkeepers as barbaric, arrogant, and uncivilized.

## Humility vs Pride: The Ka'thoorin Discourse
Within Ka'thoor, about half the local population finds themselves on a spectrum of beliefs that spawn from the city's difficult past involving slavery and rebellion.

On one end of this spectrum exist the Bloodkeepers. These individuals are proud warriors who seek to honor those who fought for their freedom during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. These individuals are know to be loud and proud. They train to be fearsome fighters and seek to *preserve* the fury of their ancestors. Many of these individuals are skilled and honorable warriors wo do well in the upholding of their peoples fighting spirit. Unfortunately others are violent brutes who see it as 'their turn' to be in power. This group is seen as heroes from some perspectives, and bullies from others.

On the opposite end of the spectrum exists an unorganized group of people who follow a unique philosophy and social practice. These individuals are extremely giving and humble. They swear to pacifism and bear simple colored earrings called [[Humbelons]]. These earrings illustrate services and skills these people giving willingly to any in need. This practice is maintained as a sort of defiance to the masters of their ancestors. When the people of the city were enslaved, their masters did nothing but take and consume. In modern day the people of Ka'thoor are free. Rather than taking things for themselves, some individuals seek to give instead to help ensure the city never ventures down that path again. 

This group has no formal name, but Bloodkeepers refer to them as Bloodless. Some members of this group act as pillars of the community, giving and teaching to any who need it. Other members of this group either give to much and have to barely scrap by, or alternatively wear the [[Humbelons]] falsely for the selfless image and status they give amongst some groups. While many look at these individuals as honorable and kind, some see them as preserving the forced servitude they city once faced.

These groups are not distinct from one another, there are citizens who exist all over this spectrum. There are even some Bloodkeepers who bear [[Humbelons]]. However, most who exist on this spectrum are closer to the extremes. There is no major conflict between these groups, largely due to the passive nature of those who bear [[Humbelons]], but a tension is obviously visible at times.

## Goods and Services
 | Name | Type | Description |
 |-|-|-|
 | The Fortress | Keep | The city's main keep. Does not act as a home for the city's leadership, merely a place of meeting. |
 | Ka'thoor Station | Train Station | They city's train station |
 | Ka'thoor Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle. Located within the Fortress|
 | The Kala'dola | Colosseum | The city's fighting arena, and main meeting place for Bloodkeepers. Many people come here for the almost daily fights. Contains a popular tavern for fighters. |
 | Trade Town | Market District | One of the largest markets in all of [[Zol]]. Full of merchants from [[Kapesh]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]]. Shops open and close in this fast moving bazaar. Many say that if it can be bought it is sold in Ka'thoor's trade town. |
 | The Bone Stack | Tavern | A tavern constructed from cobbled bones of great beasts and fallen warriors. Popular with Bloodkeepers who have distinct anti-human political views. |
 | The Crossroads Inn | Tavern | A tavern located on the edge of Aud at the crossroads of Alderun, The Witchlands, and Kapesh. It is a common waypoint for travelers entering or leaving Alderun, and beastfolk coming to Ka'thoor to trade. The result of this is a tavern where strange, fun, scary, arcane, uncanny, dangerous, disgusting, and beautiful events occur on the daily. There is a sign above the door that reads in orcish "You are not an adventurer 'till you've spent the night at The Crossroads Inn". Its gruff, confident, no-nonsense-but-somehow-fun-loving tavern keep, Lep Ka'tesh is an old orcish man that can tell the stories of Zol to a level of detail that rivals that of historians. Literally. A travelling scholar named Ulen Myf from The Kybis Assembly wrote a dissertation titled Tales of the Crossroads in which she retold the stories of Lep Ka'Tesh. They contradicted many historical writings of living scholars. It grew to great popularity out of novelty. The text's new found fame brought the book into the spotlight, so he was invited to The Kybis Grounds for a formal discussion on the topic. The event was later called "The upturning of Crease Hall", to this day no victor in the debates was decided, and Lep Ka'tesh is no longer allowed on Kybis grounds. The text holds a special place in the hearts of many scholars because of the event. The copy which was hurled at Lep Katesh by Master Kimmian Vowheart is valued greately, and sits framed above the bar at The Crossroads inn. |

## Authority
The city is overseen by the [[Alderian Seat]] Elder Err'del Raeshik, a wise old orc bearing many [[Humbelons]]. The Elder's of [[Ka'thoor]] are nominated by the community. These individuals are required to live humble lives, and are removed from the position if they are caught accepting any bribe or misusing their authority. 

The garrison is overseen by Bloodkeeper Met'ish Blak. A weathered veteran orc who only takes orders directly from the [[Alderian Seat]].

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.

| Law | Severity | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Abuse of Power | High | If a city's elder is caught abusing their power in any way, they are removed from the position. |
| Refusal of Request | High | Those sporting [[Humbelons]] reserve the right to refuse the provision of a service their humbelons signify. This is beacuse they are an individual before a giver. |

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Ka'thoor]] is a strange border town filled with hospitality, and undeniable tension. Some of which is  between its humble and proud locals, even more of which between its off-human locals and human visitors.

[[Ka'thoor]] is a crucial hub of trade in [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]'s economy. It also acts as a very important resource for those who live within [[The Witchlands]], as it is a place they can venture to for supplies.

## Historical Importance
The city was the origin of the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. To this day it remains a defiant beacon of hope for all who have faced enslavement.
