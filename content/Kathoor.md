Ka'thoor, the Orcish City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and known for its eclectic citizens, spicy food, dominant population of [[Orcs]], and unique architecture that incorporates the bones of large beasts. Ka'thoor rests on the border of [[Kapesh]], and is nestled into the mountains. It is a common stop for any who leave or enter [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].

Ka'thoor was once a hub of slave trade during the [[First Age]], and was the first of the now free cities to begin the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. In its victory, Ka'thoor has created a proud, but largely welcoming culture. They keep their history in everything they do to remain a beacon to all of [[Zol]].

Ka'thoor is now a hub of trade related to rare foods, materials, collectables and art. This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor. As well as [[Kapesh]] merchants who seek the rare good sold within the city.

Due to its oppressive history, the city does not have nobility. Its leaders are required to live humble lives. In fact all the people of the city do what they can to maintain humility. One of the ways this is expressed is by doing favors for one another. Many members of the city's population wear unique earrings that advertise favors and skills they wish to offer to those in need. These may indicate a wish to give food, housing, repair, and even academic or religious teachings. These earring have become almost a symbol of status. It has gone to the point where this is almost a problem that serves the opposite of what it is trying to achieve. This environment makes Ka'thoor one of the most unique cities in all of Alderun.
