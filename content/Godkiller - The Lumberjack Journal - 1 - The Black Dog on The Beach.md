title: "Godkiller - The Lumberjack Journal - 1 - The Black Dog on The Beach"

I can no longer shake the vision. I see it always, no longer just when I close my eyes. The creature pulls at my soul, its begging eyes staring straight through me. At first, I thought it a symbol, or a being of some unknown origin. But I have come to think that it is none of those things. I think it is me. I do not know what it wants, but I feel a deep urge to find it.Â   

I fear that this may be my brother's doing. And if it is not, I do not wish to know what he would think of my visions. I can no longer stand his hatred. His destruction, and the horrors he conducts beneath Kapesh. I will kill for him no longer, nor will I sew more chaos. This dark campaign of his has shed more blood than I can even comprehend. I know he knows I feel this way, so I have stopped trying to hide it.

I will soon leave these terrible people and their vengeance. I wish to know the meaning of my visions. I will find it. The black dog on the beach.
