title: "Thanks"
---[[Zol]] took quite a lot of time and effort for me to build, and it wouldn't have been possible without the help, and inspiration from a lot of people in my life.

- Robyn Bixby, my partner in life and my greatest inspiration. She has been on the receiving end of my overly-active imagination for years, encouraging me and listening to my ideas the whole way through. To her, I dedicate this project.
- My family, Heidi, Keith, and Alinea Turner. The three most creative people I know. All of which are better writers than myself. I wouldn't have had any of the tools necessary for this project if it weren't for them.
- My Dungeons and Dragons party, The Wanderers, who I am sure will cause an unthinkable amount of chaos within Zol.

	- Luke Bhatia
	- Lucas Fowler
	- Matthew McGlashan
	- Casey 'Rat-Boy' O'Shea
	- David McDonald
	- Jasper Soucoup
- And my cats, Mugwort and Mushroom who kept me company at my desk as I wrote. They arguably had the most important role in the entire project.
