# Hanen
*Where heroes are born*
![[Hanen skyline.png]]

Hanen, the Brave City. Residing within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Hanen is the smallest of the Alderian cities, but has a reputable history. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. The rebels of Hanen did not have the numbers that were originally needed for its defense. The rebels had overthrown the city, but were expected to lose it against the armies of [[Kapesh]] in the coming assault. Reinforcements could not cross the expanses to support the rebels within Hanen, as South Kapesh was crawling with enemy troops.

[[Kapesh]] attempted to retake take Hanen by siege, and failed. So they tried again, and failed. They even made for a third attempt and against all odds they failed. It was at this time support from [[Holocene]] arrived. Kapesh would never lay a boot on Hanen soil again.

Historians and tacticians speculated at what gave Hanen the means to defend their city for so long, but the most concrete explanation is the citizens of Hanen fought exceptionally well. The core reasoning for this exceptional fighting became prevalent over time.

Some people of Hanen posses strange abilities, locally known as 'gifts'. A rare phenomenon, with each individual case manifesting uniquely. These abilities appear as physical or magical boons of power. Some obvious example of one possessing these powers may be able to breathe fire, climb vertical surfaces, see through walls, or manipulate the arc of a thrown object. More subtle manifestations appear as great skills. Some may not even recognize they have a 'gift'. No individual is known to posses more than one power.

Typically these powers are passed down a bloodline with an approximate 1 in 3 success rate. However some citizens may be born with new power at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. The abilities first appear around age 10. Historically the powers have been increasing in frequency and potency. Hence the past confusion regarding the strength of those from [[Hanen]], as the powers used to be quite simple.

Empowered bloodlines are heavily sought after in modern day. Due to this, most noble houses are 'gifted'. Most notably House Trent. The wealthiest family in which almost all family members are 'gifted'.

The powers of [[Hanen]] waver if a 'gifted' individual spends more than 10 years from the city, but return fully when near  the city once again. 'Gifts' cannot be passed down when birth occurs away from the city. Some suspect this is because the source of the power comes from the Glass Lake.

Identifiable by its ivy covered, weathered and off-white stone walls. Hanen is a quaint place, and recommended to any who travel. Due to Hanen's location and strong population, it has one of the safest outer wilds, allowing for expansive farms, and a sense of ease.

## Authority
The city is overseen by Poe Abbarand, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Hanen]]. Lord Abbarand is an old honorable [[Half-Elf]] man. Despite the cities culture and history, Lord Abbarand possesses no 'gift', despite his bloodline. He has always had a vision of growing [[Hanen]]. It is a small city with no shortage of resources and much potential.

Unfortunately, he spends most of his time settling squabbles amongst the noble houses and cleaning up messes caused by the 'gifted'. Despite his honor and efforts, his inability to exercise his authority upon the 'gifted' has given him a reputation of being spineless.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.

| Law | Severity | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Misuse of 'gifts' | Medium | If one uses their 'gift' to harm, intimidate, or manipulate another without due cause they are to be jailed in the keep's dungeon. (Note that despite this laws existence, it is rarely enforced. If it is enforced, the sentencing is very short.) |

## Modern Importance
In modern day, Hanen is known for giving rise to many strong warriors that make an impact all across [[Zol]]. 

It is also known to be a nice destination to visit. This is because of its safe location between [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Hanen]]. This allows one to venture out into the wilderness with little risk. A rare thing in eastern [[Zol]].

## Historical Importance
Known for withstanding siege during the [[Alderian Rebellion]] against impossible odds.

## Other Things of Note
- It is expected in the next centaury, the presence of 'gifts' and their power will plateau.
- Many 'gifts' give moderate power, but there are the special few who's abilities far exceed that of their peers.
