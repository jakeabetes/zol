*Where heroes are born*

Hanen, the Brave City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Hanen is the smallest of the Alderian cities, but has a reputable history. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. The rebels of Hanen did not have the numbers that were originally intended for its defense. The rebels had overthrown the city, but were expected to lose it against the armies of [[Kapesh]]. In the coming assault. Troops could not cross the expanses to support the rebels within Hanen, as South Kapesh was crawling with enemy troops.

Kapesh attempted to take take Hanen by siege, and failed. So they tried again, and failed. They even made for a third attempt and against all odds they failed. It was at this time support from Ka'thoor arrived. Kapesh would never lay a boot on Hanen soil again.

Historians and tacticians speculate at what gave Hanen the means to defend their city for so long, but the most concrete explanation is the citizens of Hanen fought exceptionally well. There is an old saying in Alderun "If you lost the fight, they must have been from Hanen". This is in reference both to the seemingly cosmic influence that gave the rebels victory, and the fact that many people from Hanen tend to make great adventurers.

Identifiable by its ivy covered, weathered and grey stone walls. Hanen is a quaint place, and recommended to any who travel. Due to Hanen's location, it has one of the safest outer wilds, allowing for expansive farms, and a sense of ease.
