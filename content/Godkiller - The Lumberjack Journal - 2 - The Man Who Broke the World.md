title: "Godkiller - The Lumberjack Journal - 2 - The Man Who Broke the World"
---
If you are reading this, I am gone. My body and soul were annihilated by the Trinity itself. A death that’s sure as stone. This is my choice. Mine. Without Therin, Zol has nothing left for me. I have lived far longer than anyone should, and seen far too much to bear. I have given up my **Word**. My immortal flesh has become an unbearable burden. I no longer wish to feel this pain.

If you are a curious passerby, who has somehow discovered the means to read Feocaul. I urge you to stop. You will find nothing within the pages but my pain. The secrets within this journal are dangerous to know. However, if you sought these out in pursuit of my brother, they may be of some use to you. That is if your mission is to die a horrible death. I will not speak of how to defeat him as my final act. My hands are red enough. I will no longer be a part of this war. Those who know my brother now only see him for his power, his genius, and his fire. I still remember him as the man who dreamt of a better world. If a method to kill the unkillable is what you hope to find, some of the other entries in this journal may set you on that path. 

I do have one final request. If you encounter my brother, tell him that I love him.
