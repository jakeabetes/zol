title: "Fate and Time"
---
Fate and Time are two integral parts to the flow of events in [[Zol]]. They can be influenced by magic, changing the world by extension. However there are a lot of rules to how these two forces work in Zol.

They are best explained via metaphor. See [The Tree in The Garden](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fNKmMDxByYW3BhBZ-39s6kK4W1jRLGqYZeYzAbPW4gw/edit?usp=sharing) to know more.
