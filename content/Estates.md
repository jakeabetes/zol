title: "Estates"
---
[[Estates]] are a type of settlement which exists outside of a City. They are similar to [[Gate Towns]] and [[Outer Villages]] in this sense alone. This is because [[Estates]] are typically owned by the wealthy, and have many defenses such as walls and armed guards. They vary in size and complexity. Sometimes they are a single building with a relatively small plot of land. Other times they are quite vast and have a whole campus of buildings.
