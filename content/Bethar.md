*Wayward God of Craft, Minor Deity*
![[Bethar.png]]

The god of mortal creation and artistry. Bethar is a quiet but important god to [[Zol]]. Bethar gives guidance and favor to mortals who seek him. His aid manifests as guided skill and inspiration.

Friend to the [[Zolaen Gods]], Bethar does not join them in their ranks. It is not known by mortals why this is. Some say it is due to his passive nature, while others say he is not of enough import to [[The Watcher]]'s mission. Because of this, the worship of Bethar is typically legal in any place where the worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]] is legal.

## Depiction
Bethar is depicted as a man of older age in fine clothing. He is known to appear as a one of [[The Triumvirate]] races when he manifests. Many people argue his true form being one of the three in specific. This is however, regarded as religious propaganda by most.

## Symbolism
A tree on a light blue circle, similar to that on his forehead. No one knows the true nature of this symbol.

## Behavior
Bethar is known to form a personal connection with many of his followers. He gives those he forms a bond with great time and care. Existing to them almost as an unseen friend. His mission is to guide mortals along the path of their own creation. To Bethar, creation itself is divinity.

## Realm
Bethar resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], despite not being one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. This is likely due to some relationship he has with them that is poorly understood by mortals.

## Worshipers
Bethar's followers are known to be craftsmen or artists. Few churches exist to Bethar in comparison to many other gods, and those that do are humble in their scale. 

Communion with Bethar usually takes place whilst performing an act of craftsmanship.  This act itself is usually seen as the equivalent of worship or prayer.
