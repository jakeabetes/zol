![[The Vast Sea.png]]

An endless, daunting horizon of sea. [[The Vast Sea]] is the furthest west named region of [[Zol]]. Thought by many to be endless, this sea gives life to those who reside on the coasts of the west, and some who spend their whole lives upon it on the strange [[Keepships]].

There are tales of treasures, kingdoms, and monsters that lie beyond the eyes limits in the west. Some chase these treasures to never return, while others respect the peril of an endless sea. 

## History and Inhabitants
Many of [[Laenwalde]]'s people make use of its coasts for fishing and other naval purists and even that of the woodland [[Elves]] will reap its bounty with regularity.

Then of course there is the [[Keepships]]. A collection of huge, and seemingly impossible sea vessels that carry small cities on their backs. These ships are kept magically afloat, pilot themselves, and may even posses a soul. Each of these ships has a unique culture and appearance. Some are welcoming and love to trade, while others are hostile towards outsiders, and even other [[Keepships]]. Those who live on these vessels are, unique to say the least. Rarely exposed to the cultures and events of the outside worlds, the Keepshippers are  known to be hearty, unusual, and probably a bit dirty compared to the standards of The Three Corner's cities.

Despite their isolation, and great lengths of time spent at sea, those of the [[Keepships]] do not go without. The ships sail them selves on courses to do trade, fish, harvest, and avoid bad weather. Pirates that have attempted to attack Keepships were met with nigh-impenetrable defenses.

Keepshippers are the most familiar with [[The Vast Sea]], and tell the grandest stories of it. One story in particular is popular all over [[Zol]]. That of Lorelhiem, a supposed distant land in the far far west shrouded in magical fog that makes it dangerous to approach.
