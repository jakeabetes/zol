*Jaw, Horror of Galfora, Bearer of The Word of Wrath, Wielder of [[The First Tongue]]*
![[Jaw.png]]

Living destruction, the killer of men. Jaw, a presumed full blooded orc, he is the unstoppable [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origins. Jaw single handedly ended the [[Western War]]. No one knows Jaw's motivation for his destruction, but he is seen as a territorial and evil being.

## Origin
It is not known what caused Jaw to snap, but he first appeared during the [[Western War]] after the destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]]. Forces of [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] were advancing on the city of [[Corinth]]. As they reached the north, in the forest of Galfora, the incoming armies were intercepted by Glassian troops. A bloody battle was fought, and was leaning in favor of the invaders. 

The battle was instantly swayed when an unknown man, Jaw, suddenly entered the fight. He bore no weapons, but killed nearly the entire invading force on his own. Even [[The Word of Blades]], who was there that day could not defeat him. The invaders were forced to retreat. Further invasion attempts were met with the same fate. Jaw's wrath was so powerful, it leveled the forest of Galfora. The region is now known as the [[Wrath Wastes]].

## Behavior
Jaw is known to reside within the [[Wrath Wastes]], and occasionally attack those who would threaten [[The Glassius Reach]]. It is not known why he defends the changeling kingdom. He does not attack everyone, but since the threat is ever-present, few traverse the region.

## Cultural Significance 
- Many see Jaw as a force of evil. [[The Glassius Reach]] do not even view him as a protector, as since the [[Western War]], he has attacked [[Changelings]] who venture through the [[Wrath Wastes]] on occasion.
