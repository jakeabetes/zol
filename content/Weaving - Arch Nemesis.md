title: "Weaving - Arch Nemesis"
---Grimbel has had many arch-nemeses in his life, but Howdy was by far the most devious. His last nemesis, Rozwald, had left him Howdy. Grimbal suspected it was a parting gift of sorts. Or possibly this was part of that smoky little grung’s grand plans? That devious bastard. Rozwald had vanished into thin air a week ago. Or had it been 19 weeks? Somewhere in that range. Regardless, Howdy was quite the admirable foe and a more than adequate replacement for Rozwald.

Grimble had made the mistake of shaking Howdy’s hand upon meeting him. Crushed it like a bird’s egg! It was a good thing Grimble knew meta-physical surgery. But even with his skill, his arm was left in a sling. Most of his fingers were pointing in the right direction now though!

Grimble was fairly certain he had laid out the whole "arch-nemesis" agreement thing for Howdy. However, it wasn’t always easy to tell with him. *How-dee. How-di! Howdy*… It was the most Grimble could ever get from the Warforged. Grimbal had done what he could to learn his new foe’s odd one-word dialect. But it was difficult to pick up a new tongue when one spent most of their time running from a crazed warforged through the sewers of Ryze.

Ahh well… what can you do? Leave it to Rozwald to think of something like this. Grimble could only hope that Rozwald’s life was equally perilous and that he hopefully found a confusing robot of his own.
