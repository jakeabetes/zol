During the day, the city is relatively quaint and quiet. Common folk work the farms and business bumbles away normally. This all fades away to strange parties, distant hysterical laughter, and growls of monsters (if you believe the rumors). Some say that it is urban legend, while others tell stories of curses from [[The Witchlands]] or that the veil between the [[Fell]] and [[Fey]] is thinner in [[Viscera]].
