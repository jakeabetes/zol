## Description
[[Goliaths]] are the some of the largest of [[Zol]]'s people. Their size and might makes them fearsome warriors. They appear very similarly to [[Humans]], but are far stronger, and taller. They also bear a hearty resistance to the elements, being able to reside in very warm or cold climates. Despite their imposing size, many have a reputation of being very laid-back beings.
