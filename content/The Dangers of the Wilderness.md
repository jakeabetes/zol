title: "The Dangers of the Wilderness"
---
[[Zol]]'s wilderness is remarkably dangerous. Threats like beasts, monsters, and criminals make life outside of civilization very deadly for the average person. This is why transportation like [[Trains]] and [[Airships]] were so revolutionary.

The dangers of the wild are what caused the cities to become what they are, massive bastions of safety with large populations. It is also why there are huge distances between cities. Many tried to found cities over the ages, however the vast majority didn't grow past the size of a small settlement before they were destroyed. These vast distances between them are also what made the cities so unique from one another. Their culture's were formed largely in isolation, and only began to regularly cross over with each other when [[The Iron Tracks]] were built.

However, the wilderness is not impassable. There have been many in [[Zol]]'s history with enough agency to move about them without extreme danger. Some even live their whole lives within the wilderness. This is made possible only through some form of protection. Be it their own power, or the power of another which guides them. 

As an example, some wizards build towers in [[The Witchlands]] to get away from society. Their magical power acting as their defense against threats. Then there are places like The Ashcamps within [[The Kulpis Desert]]. Their protection comes in the form of warriors who hold back the threats which stalk the dunes. Allowing for more normal people to live with relative safety inside the camps.
