title: "Godkiller - The Lumberjack Journal"

*Amongst the rubble of the ruined Lumberjack Tavern, our heroes discovered a collection of pages. Some of the script is legible, written in Common. However, most is written in an unknown language. A script that cannot be decoded by magic.*

*From Chapter Summary 14: "Spells \[used to decipher text\] are a mosaic of language and cypher. Designed to decode anything written in known word and logic. When a successful casting of this nature results in no gained information, it can mean one of two things. Either it is a unique cypher that does not follow the logical pattern of any known cryptography, or it is not based in any known language. Both are exceptionally rare, and significant. The latter especially so."*

*What follows is the known contents of these strange pages listed in the order that they are discovered, not the order that they would have been written in the Journal.*
