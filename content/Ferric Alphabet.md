---# The Ferric Alphabet
The Ferric Alphabet is currently a set of 82 known runes. Each one of these is a unique symbol directly relating to a property of [[Zol]]. Theorized to be a product of [[The First Tongue]], these runes allow for the utilization of [[Iron Light]].

There are 10 classifications of runes

### Infra-Runes
Runes that reference the world outside of the topic of magic
- Connective
- Material
- Spatial
- Elemental
- Energetic
- Philosophical
- Bodily
- Planar

### Meta-Runes
Runes that reference magic itself
- Scholarly
- Magical

## Signets
A signet is a special pseudo-rune that does not subscribe to the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. A signet is a unique shape included in an [[Apparatum]]. It is either a piece of inlayed iron, or a symbol deeply carved into iron. It is grouped with an informational rune as well as an objective rune. This structure can be used as a unique identifier for an [[Apparatum]], or to communicate between devices if made in sets. Sets must be as identical as possible, typically made via [[Magic]].

It is imperative that signets are completely unique or they risk interacting with others that are they are not intended to. Some malicious individuals will exploit this weakness, and create devices that will interact with [[Apparatum]] they were not intended to. This can be used to listen in on communications, open doors, and sabotage devices. Some [[Artificers]] counter these attacks by embedding their signets deep within the devices, or hiding false signets.

Some devices implement a modular signets so they can be configured to communicate with many devices. This is difficult to operate skillfully, and even more difficult to create. The shape of a signet only seems to matter upon 2 dimensions, rather than 3. It is not known why this is, likely because of the 2 dimensionality of the [[Ferric Alphabet]], but it makes modular signets much more achievable.

Due to their need to be unique, many [[Artificers]] adopt a unique style to their signets, using them almost like a signature. Hence the name.

## Runic Common
Runic Common is a cypher popularized by philosophers that creates a one-to-one relationship between the [[common]] alphabet and the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. It bears no magical significance and was largely developed for the arts. Many scholars have great distaste for it.
