The Unified Kingdoms of the West. The largest political power in all of [[Zol]]. Laenwalde is a kingdom formed of the island of [[Arcadia]], the green hills of [[Eucaren]], and the mysterious sands of [[Saen]].

## Cities
Laenwalde is comprised of the three unified Kingdoms 
- **Arcadia**
	- [[Audran]] - The Ruin City
	- [[Penthe]] - The City of Glory
	- [[Ryze]] - The Tower City
- **Eucaren**
	- [[Kahdinacht]] - Wine and Luxury
	- [[Woogis]] - Slow Country Life
	- [[Reach Run]] - The Central Hub of [[Airships]]
- **Saen**
	- [[Kosskazoka]] - The Neon City
	- [[Diddan]] - The Wild West
	- [[Rockfire]] - The Volcanic City

As well as a shared capital, The Floating City of [[Heliodor]] and its terrestrial sister settlement, [[Nerousea Station]].

## Wilderness and Climate
Each of Laenwalde's three regions has its own natural landscape that differs from its neighbors
- **Arcadia** - A well mapped and inhabited island. The wilderness of the island is tamed more than most places of [[Zol]], but still presents moderate danger for those unprepared. It's north is full of the snowcapped peaks of [[The Auroran Summits]] which are inhabited by territorial [[Dragons]].
- **Eucaren** - The wilderness of Eucaren is most associated with the beautiful Madre'ells. A vast expanse of forest covered hills. Known to be the most tame wilderness in all of [[Zol]], this region supplies the people of Eucaren with many resources. While reasonably safe, there are some great threats that reside in the deepest parts of the forest. Its north east contains [[The East Mounts]], a remarkably dangerous mountain range that is thought to be cursed in the teachings of [[Elves]]. Its north west extends into Yaa'Fedell, the forest of the wood elves. This territory was gifted to Eucaren long ago as a thankful gift from the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] for their aid in war against [[The Glassius Reach]]. 
- **Saen** - The Desert of The Three Corners. Saen is possesses great sand dunes, Oases, the mesas of [[The Kodoros]], active volcanoes, and [[The Savanah]]. Its wilderness is extremely hostile but holds resources and treasure that can only be obtained within its sands. While the region is a challenge to traverse, an advancement in Apparatum technology known as [[Skimmers]] have made navigating the desert much easier.

All of Laenwalde is notably covered in ruins of old forts, castles, towns and other settlements. This is because of the frequent destruction that occurred during [[The Taming of the Badlands]].

## History
Once know as The Badlands, a lawless wild of disordered society. Its chaos was quelled over a long effort known as [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. A long history of feudal battles, and large scale wars between various powers that rose and fell in a complicated political and military game.

This game took a much different appearance after the attack of [[The Castle of Bodies]], a horrible event that involved one of the [[Void Gods]] appearing in the [[Prime Material Plane]] and attacking the city of [[Audran]].

After the chaos, a the ruling council discovered a living heir to the first king of [[Laenwalde]]. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed and the new capital [[Heliodor]] was constructed.

## Inhabitants
The people of [[Laenwalde]] hail from all [[Races]] and have many different backgrounds and cultures. After [[The Awakening]], Laenwalde's region was more racially diverse than any other. This set aside many issues other regions faced, but made unification much more difficult.

The people of each region are stereotyped as follows:
- **Arcadia** - Thought to be an overly proud and patriotic people. Those who hail from the island think that Arcadia is the 'true' heart of the kingdom as it is where the capital was once from and now homes the strongest military in [[Zol]].
- **Eucaren** - Thought to be a soft and laid back people. The disproportionate population of [[Halflings]], finest alcohols, and proportionally safest wilderness in all of [[Zol]].
- **Saen** - Thought to be a rough around the edges people. Gruff gun slinging westerners, dirty beggars of the neon city, or religious devotees of the volcanic temples. 
The different groups all coexist, but do tend to have a great deal of prejudice. However the people of Eucaren are seen as extremely friendly and unproblematic all across [[Zol]]. They are typically welcomed anywhere.

## Government, Economy, and Laws
Laenwalde is ruled by [[King Tatelak II]] and his advisory council. This rule is conducted from the floating city of [[Heliodor]]. The instilment of [[King Tatelak II]] upon his throne in the flying city was done as an effort to rekindle the hope people once had for [[Laenwalde]]. However many feel there is a disconnect between the crown and its people. They were ruled by a council for so long and now feel that they are under the foot of a distant leader. The King's disposition is well intentioned, but in reality he is inexperienced and it has been a large change for [[Laenwalde]].

Laenwalde's economy is quite self sufficient, the kingdom is large enough to provide all resources they reasonably require. There is a fair deal of trade of rare imports and exports from the east.

The [[Laenwalde Laws]] are consistent across all regions. This is good for maintaining order, but difficult for some as many feel that the laws should not be enforced as a wide net for all the regions and their cities. They instead push for each region having its own set of laws.

## Arts, Culture, and Religion
The regions of [[Laenwalde]] all have a unique art and culture associated with them:
- **Arcadia** - known for upholding the ideals of success, glory and being well mannered. Its ideals are presented in its art in examples like: realism, complex musical compositions, glamorous fashion, and rare foods.
- **Eucaren** - known for treasuring the ideals of community and the natural world. This is seen in its art as: simple instruments played with a high degree of skill, highly stylized paintings, and dramatic storytelling
- **Saen** - known for idealizing the concepts of strength and enduring hardship. Its art manifests as martial combat, weapon craftsmanship, large narrative murals, and sculptures.

## Academics and Magic
Academia in [[Laenwalde]] is almost exclusively associated with [[The University]]. An institution that explores all three of [[The Wills]] with a dedicated branch of The University:
- The [[Arcanum]], focused on the pursuit of [[Arcana]]. Its primary campus located within the city of [[Ryze]].
- The [[Viridium]], focused on the understanding of the natural world through [[Viridescence]]. Its primary campus located in [[Kahdinacht]].
- The [[Observum]], focused on forming and comprehending mortal bonds with [[Gods]]. Its primary campus located within [[Rockfire]].
The [[Arcanum]] is by far the largest branch of [[The University]]. This is because [[Arcana]] best fits to conventional academics. Its counterparts deal with two main factors that make its pursuit much more difficult to approach empirically:
- The experience of using one of these wills ([[Observance]] or [[Viridescence]]) is very subjective and differs from person to person
- There is no sure-fire method of gaining the ability to use these wills. They require patience, skill, and a rare predisposition to access
Because of this, the majority of the members of these branches are non-magic-practicing academics.

## Political Climate
The people of the kingdom are in a strange place. For many years they have been governed by a council. This council was fairly adept at allocating resources and maintaining general order. However the frequent drama, espionage, intrigue, and assassinations that occurred amongst the council appeared as poor rulership to its people. This, mixed with the hardships like: high taxes, overpopulation, conflicts between locals and law enforcement, and clashing cultures made for poor public opinions of rulership and general unhappiness within the kingdom.

In an effort to combat this, the council instilled a new king. A long lost direct descendant of the kingdom's first, and beloved ruler. [[King Tatelak II]] was put on the throne with the council as his advisors. The new rule is conducted from the new capital of [[Heliodor]].

This change has altered opinions. Some for better and some for worse. Many think it is good to have a sole king and not the chaotic rule of the council. Others feel that the king is distant, detached, and inexperienced upon his throne in the flying city.

## Military
Tacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Laenwalde]] has the largest army by far. The kingdoms is so grand and diverse it makes up for any lack of quality with quantity. The only hope an outside foe (other than possibly [[Gethsemane]]) would have of defeating them would be to re-open the political divides that exist between the three regions.
