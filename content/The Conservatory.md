[[The Conservatory]] is the sole institution under [[The University]] focused on the understanding of [[Viridescence]] and its relationship to [[Zol]]. Located within [[Kahdinacht]], It is a beautiful building, full of plants and natural light. Its halls are populated by [[Druids]], academics, physiqers, and the controversial [[Antiverdants]]. It is a school who's aim is to better the world's connection to, and understanding of itself. There are no major groups within [[The Three Corners]] who have a negative perception of the [[Viridium]]. It is an unproblematic organization whos major goals align with life itself.

Life within the [[Viridium]] is a peaceful one, but it is laborious. Many academics spend their days studying the effects and application of [[Viridescence]], or work to broaden the scope of medicine. Those who are not studying usually work as healers, or maintaining the facility itself. The [[Viridium]] also sends out many to travel [[The Three Corners]] to search for understanding, and new life which can further academia.

Those who can conduct magic using [[Viridescence]] are often called [[Druids]] or [[Antiverdants]]. Those who heal without the use of magic go by the name of physiqers. Education is conducted within the halls, but it is not as formal as that of the [[Arcanum]] or [[Observum]].

## Admission
Anyone can join the [[Viridium]], but staying within it is a challenge. If one cannot prove themselves capable or otherwise worthy of the station, they are expelled.

## Leadership
The head of [[The Conservatory]] is a single individual known as the High Se'kir. They are selected by popular vote amongst all other Se'kir once every 10 years. The current leader is High Se'kir Fjor Mizella, a tabaxi woman of great wisdom.
