## Overview
[[Ashian]] is a Trinity-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]], most notably [[Kapesh]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that all things, even the [[Gods]], are only allowed to exist through [[The Trinity]]. It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god. It also deifies [[Wordbearers]] as small [[Gods]].

The [[Ashian]] denomination is known for its worship of [[The Word of Fire]]. It is named after those who witnessed the snapping of [[The Word of Fire]], ash covered priests who witnessed the [[Wordbearer]] discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. The religion originally stemmed from [[Trinaism]]. Though through its close connection to [[The Word of Fire]], the denomination transformed rapidly, and broke off of [[Trinaism]].

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
In regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Ashian]] scripture believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[Ashian]] scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]], allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].

### Ancient Society
[[Ashian]] scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].

### The Undoing
[[Ashian]] scripture views [[Humans]] as a sacrifice in the context of [[The Undoing]]. [[Ashian]] belief says that [[Humans]] fought alongside the [[Zolaen Gods]] against [[The Shroud of the Void]]. In the later stages of the battle, [[The Shroud of the Void]] began to take over the minds of [[Humans]]. So the [[Humans]] willingly gave up their [[Great Magic]], giving the [[Zolaen Gods]] the upper hand to seal the [[Void Gods]] away permanently within [[The Void]]. However, this was at a great cost. In an attempt to evade imprisonment, [[The Shroud of the Void]] used all of the power it had stolen from the [[Humans]] in an attempt to destroy [[The Watcher]]. [[The Shroud]] was unsuccessful in killing [[The Watcher]], but his destruction still caused [[The Undoing]].

## Church Structure
Similar to [[Trinaism]], the [[Ashian]] church has a strict adherence to the idea of hierarchy. However, unlike [[Trinaism]], [[Ashian]] worship is not segmented into many smaller churches across [[The Three Corners]]. Instead, The [[Ashian]] church is a single organization, The [[Church of Three Fires]].

At the churches head exist two individuals. [[The Word of Fire]], and **The Grand Conflagrator**. [[The Word of Fire]] holds a unique role within the church. This is because he is seen as a piece of divinity himself. [[The Word of Fire]] does not lead the church in teachings, but instead exists as a messiah. [[The Word of Fire]] is seen as a royal, holy protector and a source of wisdom. [[The Word of Fire]] appoints a Grand Conflagrator. The Grand Conflagrator leads the whole of the [[Church of Three Fires]] in religious matters. The Grand Conflagrator is responsible for directing the teachings of the church, maintaining hierarchy, and resolving issues of faith.

The Grand Conflagrator leads the headquarters of the organization, The Cathedral of Three Fires in [[Stigmata]]. Beneath The Grand Conflagrator are **High Conflagrators** and **Conflagrators**. Individuals of these ranks are permitted to oversee churches of their own. Beneath them are **High Priests** and **Priests**.

The church also sees the [[Galliard Crown]], and the kingdom of [[Kapesh]] as holy.

## Followers
### Modernist
Modernist belief largely focuses on worship and reverence of [[The Trinity]], [[The Wills]], [[The Word of Fire]], [[Galliard Crown]], and [[Kapesh]] as a whole. It views [[Humans]] as the brave sacrifice which saved the world from total antihalation. It is thought that only [[Humans]] can only restore their [[Great Magic]] through the church's wisdom. It also holds the belief that all things are intended, and that [[The Trinity]] will see [[Zol]] reach an age of glory once again, so long as its followers stay true.

### Fundamentalist
Fundamentalist belief focuses on the ideals of sacrifice, hierarchy, and Human Sovereignty. It has a reputation of being the most brutal Trinity-Centric belief system within [[The Three Corners]].
