*Wayward God of Ice, Minor Deity*
![[Eptro.png]]

Lord of the frost, Eptro is the spirit of ice and the frozen expanses that exist in [[Zol]]. A mysterious being who's concerns rarely extend outside of it's domain. Academic evidence found in [[The Grand Nothing]] indicates that [[Eptro]] is one half of a greater being that was fractured into two parts. Its other half being [[Daetro]], who it seems to act opposite to.

## Depiction
Witnessed as a giant humanoid form of ice that forms and shatters constantly as it moves. Its presence causes the surrounding environment to freeze over almost instantaneously.

## Symbolism
The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol of frost.

## Behavior
Acting more like a force of nature rather than a conventional god, [[Eptro]] cares for its domain of [[The Korus Arctic]]. It defends its sanctity like a sort of sentinel, making it very hard for explorers to venture deep into its mysterious realm.

Known for sending beasts and envoys after those who travel too far north, [[Eptro]] does occasionally form bonds with mortals granting them guidance and powers.

## Realm
[[Eptro]] is one of the few gods who resides on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Residing in the far north of [[The Korus Arctic]].

## Worshipers
Few seek [[Eptro]] as a god. Those who do are known as mystics and druids. Usually residing in remote locations.
