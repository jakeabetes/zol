title: "Often"
---*The City of Honorable Viking Warriors*
![[Often Skyline 2.png]]

Long ago, [[Often]] was the least notable city of [[The Ward]]. However this changed significantly when half of the kingdom's cities were destroyed during [[The Dragon War]]. The city was only able to survive its destruction due to its persevering warriors. In modern day, these warriors are most associated with [[The Ramshorn]], a guild of warriors who are known to fight for the [[The North Honor]] and the greater good of [[Zol]]. The city of cobbled stone and copper roofs is frequently shrouded in a thick, cold fog. Despite its gloomy weather, its people are a known for their jolly community.

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Often]] is most know for [[The Ramshorn]]. The warriors that come from this guild are known to make an impact wherever they venture.

## Historical Importance
Historically, [[Often]] has not played a major role outside of [[The Ward]]. Within the history of the kingdom, it fought during [[The Dragon War]]. It was assumed by many to fall to the [[Dragons]], but its stone walls and brave fighters proved greater than the challenge posed.

## Other Things of Note
- [[Stormdew]] is minor acidic as it ferments, making the copper roofs shine after it is blown away in the abrasive [[Greatwinds]]
