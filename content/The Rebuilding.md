---# The Rebuilding
An era of [[Zol]] spent in great difficulty. Wilds were tamed, the first cities were built, and the last generation of the old world began to die off. The new people of [[Zol]] were left to their devices against the harsh dangers of [[Zol]].

## The Beginning of the Rebuilding
The Rebuilding started when the [[The Kybis Assembly]] was founded. This is recognized as its commencement because of the needs of a large scale academic institution, and its ability to record history.

When society was able to allocate its resources enough to focus give rise to greater minds, and archive its past it makes for an entirely different world. Other people groups began to follow their example and all felt the benefits over time.
