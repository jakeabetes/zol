title: "Attunement"
---[[Attunement]] is the process by which an individual is able to use a magical object. This may be [[Apparatum]] or some more powerful [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. Regardless of make, most individuals can only attune with around 3 objects. However some can utilize many more.

Not all [[Magic]] objects require [[Attunement]] if they are simplistic in their make. Academics do not know why there is a limit to [[Attunement]], but the working theory is the limit of one's [[Vizir]].
