 - Slaying Skimmer-Back Ger'zar Bandits in the Baradan Canyon
	 - One kept screaming "Autonom" in reverence at Sherman
 - Made camp in a set of twisted ruins, warped by the effect of The Undoing
	 - They discovered a long forgotten body crucified in the Arkian fashion. Likely a traitor to someone out in the lawless Grand Nothing.
	 - Seemed to be a place frequented by travellers, covered in graffiti and the droppings of old camp sites
 - The group rested well, but during the night secrets shifted amongst our heroes' shadows
	 - Sherman contacted... someone via span-read. An individual asking if he had infiltrated "The Guild" yet.
		 - The unknown contact seemed keen on Sherman finding whoever made "The Discovery"
		 - Was told to show them his "Mask of Iron"
	 - Rozwald dreamt of the ruins in which he slept. However, they were vacant, and enshrouded in smoke.
		 - In the din, he spotted a shape standing in the door which had once held the crucified body. Egan. His father's late Colleague.
			 - A supposed genius who died of the same type of affliction Rozwald suffers from. Materiation into smoke.
		 - He was seen smoking from the same pipe which Rozwald regularly uses
		 - They spoke of Rozwald's father, a distant, challenging, and driven man.
		 - They also spoke of the burden of potential, and how Egan was keen on seeing Rozwald use his.
 - Our heroes set off in the morning, reaching The Drifting Isles at the later half of the next day.
- With some difficulty, the group managed to use the Drift Spiker, an Apparatum (lent by the Blade Hammer Guild) capable of producing a Zipline instantaneously to get atop the isle approximately indicated by Professor Abby. 
	- Sherman's fear of heights was no aid in the matter.
- Initial scouring of the otherworldly floating island quickly revealed the presence of a full grown Rok, one of the colossal red predatory birds that was spotted while descending Gilligan's Lift. 
	- Luckily the group managed to stay hidden, and identify the approximate location of its nest on an adjacent drifting isle due to Deimos' keen senses.
- Our Heroes had to hunt for their mark stealthily, the Rok noticed their presence via scent, but not their location.
- A strange, person sized impact crater was found on the rain forest like island. Along with small pieces of a Warforged, and massive Rok-sized Talon prints in the mud.
- The group deduced that the territorial bird had likely picked up the shiny treasure, and brought it back to its nest.
	- There was also brief mention of how you all shared a premonition of this mission.
- A clever distraction was built using Rozwald's cunning. His "rat-smacker" was turned into a remarkably effective noise maker by sacrificing Sherman's cook pot.
- The noisemaker was flung off the island, into the depths below, causing the Rok to chase after it
- In a rush of sheer excitement, panic, and fear, our heroes crossed over to the next island via Drift Spiker and stormed the nest
- It was a colossal structure, made of full sized logs and thick mud. The great nest was lined with bits and bobs of shiny metal
	- Corpses adorned in steel armor 
	- Old skimmers, some in reasonable condition, but most were total wrecks
	- And of course, the Warforged. Precisely the same as the one in your shared dream, something clutched tightly in is remaining fist.
- But before you could reach it, an oversized, disturbing, pink skinned, barely feathered, baby Rok emerged from behind a pile of wrecked skimmers. Its bulging eyes blinking with a dangerous curiosity at the party.
