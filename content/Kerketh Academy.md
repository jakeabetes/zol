## Values
*"Knowledge, wisdom, and agency are the foundations of a better world."*

[[Kerketh Academy]] was originally a sister school built by [[The Kybis Assembly]]. It was to serve the purpose of bolstering lesser minds, to find those capable of great things. Those who would prove themselves would be given a chance at entry into The Assembly. However the [[Alderian Rebellion]] changed all this. It is now a place where anyone can come to learn, and better their minds.

## Origin
Built as a supporting organization for [[The Kybis Assembly]], the ideals of the [[Alderian Rebellion]] have reshaped it to a place for the common person to make themselves into something more.
