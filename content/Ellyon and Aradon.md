title: "Ellyon and Aradon"
---*Wayward Gods of Seafaring and Skyfaring, Minor Deities*
![[Ellyon and Aradon.png]]

The offspring of [[Ohlit]]. Ellyon the daughter of sea and Aradon the son of sky. Guardians who have domain over those who brave the parts of [[Zol]] that border dangers beyond. The Sea and Sky.

These two deities are never seen without one another. Because of this they are typically grouped together in worship.

Millennia ago, these beings were thought to only concern themselves with the on goings of the sea. This was changed when [[Airships]] were invented, and these beings communed with the crews of sky vessels in the same manner they had previously only done with that of ships at sea.

## Depiction
Ellyon is depicted as a giant elegant mermaid like being, who soars gracefully and sings beautiful, yet haunting songs.

Aradon is a colossal whale like being whos flesh is marred by thousands of old scars.

Witness accounts tell of these beings swimming gracefully through the sea, or soaring weightlessly through the sky.

## Symbolism
Two sets of tail fins rotated opposite to one another. 

## Behavior
These two beings act as mediating forces for the ongoing events of mortals in the sea and sky. They protect mortals from the dangers of the void that exist at the fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as interfering with the fates of sailors based on the morality of their intentions.

They do this by sending omens as warnings, or beasts and forces of nature to deter any ship who sails a dark course.

## Realm
[[Ellyon and Aradon]] reside in [[The Immortal Ocean]].

## Worshipers
These beings are payed prayer, respect and sacrifice by sailors both of sea and sky. Some organized churches exists on the coasts, but the most common physical manifestation of this deity is beaded necklaces worn by many sailors. Due to their association with [[Ohlit]], their worship is typically allowed anywhere worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]] is.
