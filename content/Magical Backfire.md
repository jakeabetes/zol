title: "Magical Backfire"
---Magical backfire is the result of improper usage or over-usage of [[Magic]]. It is the result of unbound power lashing out from [[The Trinity]]. It can manifest in many ways, but is usually known as one of the following:
- Biological or psychological damage
- Explosions of [[energy]]
- Wild magic
- Damage to one's [[Vizir]]
- Death

The latter 2 being the most dreaded by magic users. In the case of damage to one's [[Vizir]], it results as a [[Caster]] having their magical capacity decreased, or lost entirely.
