title: "Zolaeum Notica"
---*Zolaeum Notica is the Human translation of 'Notes on Zol'*

A Text written by Aldaemus Mysc on the subject of [[Zol]]'s history, gods, magic and planes. This text is particularly significant as it was the first academic text written with the express purpose of explaining the world of [[Zol]] at an accessible level, to anyone who would read it. It was unbiased, and unspeculative. Only covering what was known by scholars as fact.

It contains:
- Maps of [[Zol]]
- Details on the [[Gods]]
- A telling of major histories
- An explanation of [[Magic]]
- A list of known [[Planes]] and how they manifest

The text was distributed to the masses. Translated into many languages, the text was printed on inexpensive paper and made to be as small as possible. This allowed for efficient and cheap and broad distribution. It also caused many nobles and scholars to disregard or mock it.

This text was so influential because until this point, many of [[Zol]]'s people were in the dark about how their world functioned. Most people relied on word of mouth, religious dogma and folklore to understand their home.

Many attribute [[Iron Light]] as the greatest advancement ever made in [[Zol]], however some believe that [[Zolaeum Notica]] was the first true step towards the modern world. It gave the common person the perspective they needed to begin true learning.

Some uneducated individuals or heavily indoctrinated peoples reject the text as a sort of propaganda. 

In modern day, the members of [[The University]] release an up-to-date version of the text every 10 years to improve on its reservoir of knowledge.
