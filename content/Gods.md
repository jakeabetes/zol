# The Gods of Zol
In [[Zol]], a god is defined by as a being that fits into one or many of these criteria:
- Is worshiped by many beings
- Is powerful enough to bestow some of their power to another being for an unlimited amount of time
- Has dominion over a non-artificial plane of existence
- Is immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]]

The gods are very present in [[Zol]], each in their own unique ways. The effect society by communicating with, or granting power to mortals. Some gods even take a mortal form to move amongst society. This influences can be well intended, or malicious in nature.

There are many gods that exist in [[Zol]], all with different intentions, morality, and powers. Some gods are supremely powerful, while others are limited in their influence. While the gods themselves have complex relationships that are not well understood by the civilizations of [[Zol]], society has organized them into pantheons to better comprehend them.

## Main Pantheons
The main pantheons are:
- The [[Zolaen Gods]]
	- The creators of [[Zol]]. A pantheon of gods who act with [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their king. Doing everything they can to see his image of [[Zol]] come to fruition.
- The [[Wayward Gods]]
	- Beings of [[Zol]] who are as powerful as gods, but do not see [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their ruler. They act on their own accord.
- The [[The Wandering Gods]]
	- A group of alien beings who appeared to mortals after the [[Desolation]]. Mysterious in nature these gods not act like the others. Some think they caused the [[Desolation]], other think they are guardians; protecting mortals from the dangerous whims of other [[Gods]].
	- These gods are not nearly as powerful as one of the individual [[Zolaen Gods]], but they are in an ever bound alliance to each other. This makes them one of the greatest forces in [[Zol]].
- The [[Void Gods]]
	- Beings who hate [[Zol]]. They crawled out of the [[Sea of Monsters]] to destroy [[Zol]], and return it to the chaotic feast of power it once was.

## Minor vs Major Deities
Minor Deities are beings who have a great deal of power that gives them a degree of uniqueness and domain over some aspect of [[Zol]] that is not contested by any mortal. These beings have the ability to not only control their domain, but give power to other beings to carry out their will.

Major Deities are beings who are vastly more powerful than all other beings. To these entities, Minor Deities are only a small threat. Their power and influence is only kept in check by other Major Deities with a contradictory will. To these creatures, mortals are but a miniscule blip in the cosmos. 

## Wordbearers
Mortals who have achieved the ability to harness [[The First Tongue]] are known as [[Wordbearers]]. They are considered gods by some. It is not known how many [[Wordbearers]] there are, but the ones who are public play a large role in society.

## Cosmic entities
Outside of [[Zol]] and its planes, beyond the [[The Great Wall of Roots]], there lies an infinite cosmic expanse. Almost nothing is known of this strange outside world, but it is understood that the world of [[Zol]] itself may be the dead body of one of its progenitors. These progenitors, known as the [[Great Old Ones]] once ruled the cosmos, but were driven away from their former power by some reality bending event. All of what is known about these beings is considered to be legend.

These beings are known of, but bear little modern significance beyond their importance in the current studies of academics.

## Religion
A complicated topic in a world with so much power, so many gods, and so little that is understood. 

[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] takes many shapes and forms.
