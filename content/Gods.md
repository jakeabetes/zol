title: "Gods"
---In [[Zol]], a god is defined by as a being that fits all of these criteria:
- Is considered by many beings as something greater than a mortal soul
- Is powerful enough to bestow some of their power to another being for an unlimited amount of time
- Has dominion over a plane of existence, or aspect of [[Zol]]
- Is immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]]

The god's influence is very present in [[Zol]], each in their own unique ways. They affect society by communicating with, or granting power to mortals. Some gods even take a mortal form to move amongst society. These influences can be well intended, or malicious in nature.

There are many gods that exist in [[Zol]], all with different intentions, morality, and powers. Some gods are supremely powerful, while others are limited in comparison. 

The gods themselves have complex relationships with their peers that are not well understood by the civilizations of [[Zol]], society has organized them into pantheons to better discuss them.

## Main Pantheons

Pantheon | Description
------------ | ------------
The [[Zolaen Gods]] | The creators of [[Zol]]. A pantheon of gods who act with [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their king. Doing everything they can to see his image of [[Zol]] come to fruition.
The [[Wayward Gods]] |  Beings of [[Zol]] who are of great, but do not see [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their ruler, nor do the commit themselves to any other group. They act on their own accord.
The [[The Wandering Gods]] | A group of alien beings who appeared to mortals after [[The Undoing]]. Mysterious in nature these gods not act like the others. Some think they caused the [[The Undoing]], other think they are guardians; protecting mortals from the dangerous whims of other [[Gods]].
The [[Void Gods]] | Beings who hate [[Zol]]. They crawled out of the [[Sea of Monsters]] to destroy [[Zol]], and return it to the chaotic feast of power it once was: The [[Sea of Monsters]].

## "God" as a catch-all term for powerful beings
There are many beings who's primary focus is to rule over some dominion as a God. However, these are not the only beings that society refers to as a god. Any being or force of extreme power may be given this title by mortals, despite their true nature.

## Minor vs Major Deities
Minor Deities are beings who have a great deal of power that gives them a degree of uniqueness and domain over some aspect of [[Zol]]. These beings have the ability to not only influence their domain, but give power to other beings to carry out their will. Sometimes these are called *Small Gods*.

Major Deities are beings who are vastly more powerful than most other beings. Their power and influence is only kept in check by other Major Deities with a contradictory will, or great efforts of coordinated weaker beings. To these creatures, a single mortal is but a blip in the cosmos. 

## Small Gods
A term similar to Minor Gods, the title *Small God* is given to beings who are seen as being at the pinnacle of mortal power, or the bare-minimum of godhood. Mostly this consists of beings like:
- [[Wordbearers]]
- Grand Insightors of [[The Kybis Assembly]]
- [[The Page of Cups]]
- [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]]
- [[King Galliard]] due to his influence over [[The Crown Titans]]
- The [[Hags]]
- Members of [[The Coven]] or [[The Cult of the Mothers]]

However some philosophers who write about individuals like Lord Leonell Vanveld of [[Holocene]] as if they are a sort of Small God due to their extreme wealth, or other power they posses. In short, the term *Small God* is not a quantifiable level of influence. It is instead a descriptor used to illustrate the assumed level of one's power, and note the fact that they bear god-like influence. 

## Wordbearers
Mortals who have achieved the ability to harness [[The First Tongue]] are known as [[Wordbearers]]. They are considered gods by some. It is not known how many [[Wordbearers]] there are, but the ones who are public play a large role in society.

## Cosmic entities
Outside of [[Zol]] and its planes, beyond the [[The Great Wall of Roots]], there lies an infinite cosmic expanse. Almost nothing is known of this strange outside world, but it is understood that the world of [[Zol]] itself may be the dead body of one of the cosmos' progenitors. 

These progenitors, known as the [[Great Old Ones]] once ruled the cosmos, but were driven away from their former power by some reality bending event. All of what is known about these beings is considered to be legend.

These beings are known of, but bear little modern significance in the day to day lives of mortals.

## Religion
A complicated topic in a world with so much power, so many gods, and so little that is understood. 

[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] takes many shapes and forms.
