# Introduction
In its [[Origin]], [[Zol]] was spun from the [[Sea of Monsters]] in words spoken by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Zol is never without strife, beauty, hardship, innovation, danger, majesty, mystery, and adventure.

A world once ruled by Elves, Dwarves and Humans. These races, known as [[The Triumvirate]] used the power of [[The Trinity]] to create an advanced and prosperous society. Sprawling cities of life, art and culture once graced Zol. This was all lost in the [[Desolation]].

Not much is known about the time before the Desolation, or what caused it to fall. Ancient texts tell stories of a heinous act made by the humans. It is knowns as [[The Undoing]], a scheme that would turn humanity so far from the light, the [[Zolaen Gods]] punished all of Zol for their crimes. They obliterated uncountable tracts of land, reducing them to dust and rubble and banished all beings to the furthest intact corners of Zol, forcing them to begin anew with no knowledge of the old world.

The final punishment of the humans was to have their [[Great Magic]] stripped from them, and fractured. From this revoked magic, the gods created a cast of new races to bear the burden of humanity's sin. These would known as the [[Off-Human]] Races

In their new home, the sapient world began to atone, rebuild, relearn for what was once lost. It was in this [[First Age]], at the edges of the world, a second pantheon of Gods was discovered. [[The Wandering Gods]], a pantheon who would garner protection for Zol from the wrath of the Zolaen Gods. The Wandering gods swore an oath to prevent the Zolaen Gods from ever creating another Desolation.

This contest between pantheons paved the way for unending ages of religious confusion, debate, and war.  It also gave hope in a time of great fear. From this chaos, Zol rose from the ashes.

Ages passed for Zol. What was once a nation of refugees now resembled a society, but merely a sliver of what it once was. In these times, only the arcane and powerful had true agency, as the [[Untamed Wilds of Zol]] were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out, until the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.

A powerful mage, named [[Mordenkainen]], devised a way for the common man to utilize and capture the magic of [[The Trinity]]. Complex practices and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs changed Zol forever.

[[The Great Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and once unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were given the agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since the [[Desolation]].

Now Zol sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity. A realm formed from the corpse of an infinite being. A developing world wrought with natural mystery, lost history, and unclaimed power. A world where anyone can claim their own destiny.
