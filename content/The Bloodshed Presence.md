*Void God of War, Minor Deity*

The rush of battle, the heat of the moment, the thrill of taking a man's life. More of an unnatural force than a convectional god, [[The Bloodshed Presence]] is a spirit that some mortals experience like a euphoric emotion when in battle, or during other acts of violence.

## Depiction
Not seen as a being with a body, [[The Bloodshed Presence]] is described as a visual hallucination where a battlefield is covered in a strange blood like substance. Some describe it as a liquid while other speak of it like sand or a strange fungus. It is the source of the phrase 'seeing red' when feeling great anger.

## Symbolism
[[The Bloodshed Presence]] has no recognizable symbolism.

## Behavior
Acting as a force, [[The Bloodshed Presence]] does not communicate with mortals and may not even be capable of such acts.

When overcome by the presence, mortals experience a rush like no other. A strange drug-like feeling that urges you to seek violence. Its effects cause memory loss, but seem to deter exhaustion.

Many who experience its influence become addicted to the feeling and do not speak of it for fear of judgement or other worse forms of societal persecution.

## Realm
[[The Bloodshed Presence]] is thought to reside in [[The Void]], but as it has no physical body it must have some manifestation in [[The Ethereal Plane]].

## Worshipers
No major groups worship [[The Bloodshed Presence]] historically, but it has a notable reputation amongst military groups. Many fear it but some do seek it out.

It is thought that a vast number of mortals who suffer the violence of [[Zol]] experience this being's influence. They either do not speak of it, or do not even know it is occurring.
