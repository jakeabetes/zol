# Chronomancy
[[Chronomancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is extremely rare. It is magic that involves the manipulation of ones location on the 4th dimensional plane of [[Nodes]], allowing the manipulation of time.

This is extremely difficult, dangerous, and frowned upon. [[Chronomancy]] allows one to move backwards, foreword, or even stop time. In all instances movement along this dimension is directly proportional to the users skill. To make things more achievable some users will attempt to send only their perspective elsewhere, allowing them to acquire information while risking much less.

This magic is used with the intention of keeping ones mind continuous while the timestream is broken. This makes it very difficult to perform. Failures can be cataclysmic, or relatively harmless. In terms of harmless failure, you could go backwards in time, but lose all your memory of doing so effectively accomplishing nothing. Alternatively one could freeze time but also freeze themselves in the process immediately ending the spell, uselessly expending great deals of energy.

More plausibly things will end up worse. A paradox could be created and cause the timeline to lash. A lashing timeline could manifest as something simple like dozens of surges of wild magic, summoning horrible beasts from the cosmos, or create tears in the planes. They could also manifest as something worse like mile long tendrils of raw energy tearing through the environment, or being removed from existence entirely.

Because of these high stakes, divine beings are known to intervene and punish those responsible. Academia holds very little knowledge about [[Chronomancy]] for all of these reasons. Only the mad pursue this practice.

## The Chronomantic Wall
[[Chronomancy]] is a relatively unexplored field due to the dangers involved. However it has been discovered that a seemingly impassible barrier exists at the moment of [[The Awakening]]. Anything that hits this wall is destroyed.
