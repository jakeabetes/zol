## Overview
[[Dorian]] is a Zolaen-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that [[Zol]], and [[The Trinity]] by extension were created by [[The Watcher in The Door]] through [[The First Tongue]]. It views the [[Zolaen Gods]] as absolute in their power, and that all other forms of divinity are not truly holy.

It also view [[The Undoing]] as a sort of salvation. There are many interpretations of the cause of the event. Regardless of personal belief [[Dorian]] worship sees the [[The Awakening]] as a second chance for [[Zol]] granted by the [[Zolaen Gods]]. The defining characteristic of [[Dorian]] belief is the focus on perfection in the eyes of [[The Watcher]], or more accurately the Church's interpretation of [[The Watcher]]'s vision.

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
In regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Dorian]] scripture tells of [[The Watcher]] defeating [[Goh'zul]], then speaking [[The First Tongue]]. [[Arkian]] belief states that by speaking it in that moment, [[The Watcher]] created [[The First Tongue]]. Though this power he bound the other [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[The Trinity]].

### Ancient Society
[[Dorian]] scripture teaches that ancient society was advanced and holy. However, it is thought that some darkness overtook the world in the later ages, which eventually lead to [[The Undoing]]. The specific nature of this darkness varies widely across various [[Dorian]] churches, and individual interpretation.

### The Undoing
As a whole, [[Dorian]] belief does not agree much on the exact nature of what caused [[The Undoing]]. Though this has not caused too much discourse within the denomination because much of [[Dorian]] belief focuses on the idea that [[The Awakening]] was a salvation for the people of [[Zol]]. Though the main belief's within [[Dorian]] worship regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]] are:
- Some great sin was carried out by all, or most of ancient civilization that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world.
- Some great sin was carried out ancient [[Humans]] that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world. This belief is largely what is accepted within the [[Dorian]] churches of [[Gethsemane]].
- An imbalance within [[The Trinity]] caused [[The Undoing]], but the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]]. This theory is particularly known for having many specific interpretations, and being particularly vague.
- Some dark force such as [[The Anti-Trinity]] or [[The Shroud of the Void]] attacked [[Zol]], and caused [[The Undoing]]. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]].

## Church Structure
[[Dorian]] churches can manifest in one of two ways. The first being places of worship which are structured to worship all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] as a whole. These are called Octainiaries, after the eight gods. The second are places of worship structured to follow a specific member of the [[Zolaen Gods]], called Moniaries. The latter still pay respect to the pantheon as a whole, but they focus on the specific teachings and domain of a singular god.

Churches may form as an individual organization, but often they are part of a larger collection of churches. Most commonly this is limited to the scope of a whole city, but sometimes they exceed that boundary.

Churches are headed either an **Octavian Priest**, or a **Monian Priest** based on the type of church. Churches with a wider network are headed by **Zoltrum Octavian**, or a **Zoltrum Monian**. Beneath an Octavian or Monian Priest there are usually **High Priests**, and **Priests**.

## Followers
### Modernist
Modernist belief largely focuses on the idea of betterment, and rediscovery of the world. By making [[Zol]] a better place, and comprehending it, one takes strides towards [[The Watcher]]'s true vision of [[Zol]].

### Fundamentalist
Fundamentalist belief largely focuses on the ideas of perfection, and living the *correct* way. This manifests as doing everything in ones power to excel at the things one dedicates themselves to, and present themselves as exemplary in the eyes of their peers, and [[The Watcher]]. In doing so, they become a piece of [[The Watcher]]'s great plan for [[Zol]]. Fundamentalist belief is also directed outwards. Fundamental Dorians often cast judgement on others, especially those who live sinful lives, or worship other gods.

## Geographically Significant Regions
- [[Dorian]] worship is extremely widespread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]]. Most notably in the western kingdoms of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]].

## Other Information
-  [[Arkian]] worship is very similar to [[Dorian]] worship, however they differ in the sense that [[Arkian]] belief focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and atonement. [[Arkian]] belief sees the modern world as an opportunity for atonement. [[Dorian]] belief instead focuses on the idea of the modern world being a second chance at life. The two churches were once a single denomination, but diverged long ago. This divergence occurred before razing events like the [[Beast Ire]] Plague, and possibly even [[The Dragon War]]. The true nature of this divergence has been lost to time, and is largely debated.
- Theologians and sociologist believe that in the coming centauries, more branches of Zolaen-Centric belief will break off [[Dorian]] worship due to differences in beliefs regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]].
