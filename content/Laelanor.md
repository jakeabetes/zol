title: "Laelanor"
---*The Tree-Top City of Wood Elves*
![[laelanor skyline 2.png]]

In the far west, within the mystical forest of Yaa'fedell, on  the hilly coast of [[The Vast Sea]] rests the viridescent city of [[Laelanor]]. The city is amalgamated into the massive trunk of [[The Hailent Tree]], the largest of its rare species known as [[The Provident Oaks]]. Home to the Wood [[Elves]], the city's people are all raised with the lessons of [[The Path]]. A set of philosophies, skills, crafts, martial arts, stories, and histories that prepare one for 'a life worthy of living'.

Similar to its sister elven cities, it is not a place built for outsiders. However unlike the others it does allow visitors through an ancient law known as The Rite of Creszar. Stemming from a legend of a Dragonborn hero named Creszar who crossed [[The Three Corners]], and sought the sap of [[The Hailent Tree]] to cure his teacher of a great illness. He stayed for three days to regain his strength, and on each day of Creszar's time in [[Laelanor]], he proved himself to be a worthy guest of the city. The Rite of Creszar allows for anyone who seeks the power held within [[The Hailent Tree]] to come and stay within the city for no more than three sunrises. By the fourth sunrise, one must depart from the city and not return unless invited by the Maer, or after 50 days have passed.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city is a place of peace and wisdom. All the city's people spend their early lives learning from [[The Path]], giving all of its citizens skills in medicine, craftsmanship, philosophy, history, mathematics, druidic magic, and combat. A population made up of very well rounded citizens makes for a very capable city. |
| Main Challenge | Many outsiders feel that the city has its own unique brand of arrogance. The city's people feel that [[The Path]] is the be all, end all of knowledge. [[The Path]] is said to be the perfect way of learning and knowledge, and its only fault is the mortal understanding of it. This breeds a unique brand of stubborness that some joke "would cause an elf to sit in a burning building if [[The Path]] deemed it meaningful." |
| Climate | Temperate, costal |
| Cuisine | Largely vegetarian meals, only meat consumed is wild game. Typically prepared in the form of Tapas. |

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Laelanor]] is very isolated. Most interactions it has with the outside world are with travelling merchants, or those on a pilgrimage for healing, wisdom, or foreign treasures. It is quite difficult to navigate the dangerous forests surrounding the city, and it is almost required that one has a guide when travelling to [[Laelanor]].

## Historical Importance
[[Laelanor]] has kept to themselves politically, but is a loyal supporter for any military campaigns of [[Gethsemane]]. Their scouts were instrumental during the [[Western War]].

## Other Things of Note
- The city does not have a train station, or a teleportation circle. Making it very difficult to reach for the vast majority of the population.
- Slavery is not of [[The Path]], and is not practiced within the city. However it is not illegal.
