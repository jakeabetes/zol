title: "The Storm Horizon"
---*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

The origin of storms. [[The Storm Horizon]] is an expanse of sea, containing a monolith of solid winds at its center called The Stormheart. Near to The Stormheart lies many islands, each hosting a great hall reserved for the souls of great warriors who die in [[Adrathar]]'s favor. 

From this monolith, [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] weaves storms and sends them across [[Zol]].
