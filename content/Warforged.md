## Description
Spawned from [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] during the early 4th millennium. Some say [[Warforged]] were discovered, while others say they were created. Their bodies are comprised of engineered materials, and extremely complex [[Iron Light]] configurations. [[Warforged]] were originally used as soldiers during [[Triumvirate Battles]]. Their effectiveness in battle changed the shape of the conflict so quickly, that it brought the centuries long conflict between [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] to an end. However their usefulness to the mortal world did not end there.

[[Warforged]] became a mechanical slave race of people for the kingdoms of [[Zol]]. Made specifically to serve, their treatment became a thing of great debate. Some think that since they are machines, they do not need to be treated as people. While others believe that they are to be liberated, as they bear a soul. Unfortunately for the latter group, their voice is the minority. This is largely due to the fact that [[Low Automata]] existed prior to [[Warforged]]. This makes it so the complex, and sapient [[Warforged]] are often compared to the mundane [[Low Automata]]. In the late [[Second Age]], [[Warforged]] servants have become so commonplace that even [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], which is famous for its anti-slavery laws, allow [[Warforged]] servants.

[[Warforged]] who are created for the purpose of serving, do so willingly. The beings themselves do not seem opposed to their original purpose. However those who are not created for a purpose have been observed pursuing greater meaning. Some even 'liberate' other [[Warforged]]. This is done by subduing servile [[Warforged]] and making modifications to their [[Iron Light]] runes within. These 'liberated' [[Warforged]] also go on to pursue greater meaning.

Occasionally, [[Warforged]] will go 'rouge'. This is caused by issues with or damage to their [[Iron Light]] configurations. Nine times out of ten, this results in violent outbursts, and thoughts of insanity for these [[Warforged]]. A rogue [[Warforged]] is an extremely dangerous thing.

[[Warforged]] can be all shapes and sizes, perhaps in the most literal sense. In fact, the first [[Warforged]] was a highly complex writing utensil created during the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] at [[The University]]. They are constructed to best fulfil their purpose, but most have the ability to swap out non-integral parts such as arms and legs.

## Additional Info
- The name ''[[Warforged]]" was first given by the humans who constructed them at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. This name was given to them because of their express purpose as soldiers. After the [[Triumvirate Battles]], the name had stuck.
- [[Warforged]] and [[Low Automata]] are often confused for one another. However, [[Warforged]] posses souls, while [[Low Automata]] do not.
