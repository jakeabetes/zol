title: "The Dragon War"
---The people of [[Zol]] had little time to situate themselves after [[The Undoing]] before the first of their great challenges began. Once cities were built, the growing population of sapient creatures drew the attention of the [[Chromatic Dragons]]. The children of [[Zelatt, The Draconic Amalgam]].

These [[Dragons]] claimed [[The Three Corners of Civilization]] to be their native land, and that all who trespassed now belonged to them. The evil nature of [[Chromatic Dragons]] mixed with the desperate situation of [[Zol]]'s people made for a long drawn out war. The [[Dragons]] were few in number, but extremely powerful. They began by 'toying' with the population as if it were some sick game to them.

The [[Humans]] quickly devised a way to train dragon slayers armed with uniquely long spears, grappling hooks, and heavy bows. Their tactics spread quickly across [[Zol]], turning the conflict into an evenly matched bout.

After a time, arcanists began to discover the nature of their foe. Acting almost like a hive of bees. The [[Chromatic Dragons]], as children of [[Zelatt]] they only sought to create chaos for their mother to feed upon. It seemed the war was carefully crafted to last as long as it could.

The war dragged on for a millennium. It wasn't until [[Metallic Dragons]] sent by [[Ayamot]] to aid the people of [[Zol]] turned the tide. The [[Metallic Dragons]] were even fewer in number than the [[Chromatic Dragons]], but their paired efforts allowed them to defeat the majority of the [[Chromatic Dragons]]. The few who remained scattered across [[Zol]] to hide, and [[Zelatt]] was forced into an eternal slumber by [[Ayamot]].
