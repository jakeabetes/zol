*Note that the rarity of races is with respect to normal society in in [[The Prime]], in terms of encountering strangers Common races would be something most people see on the daily, Uncommon would be a few times in a week or month, Rare would be every few months or a year. In the greater scales of Very Rare or Extremely Rare it would likely be once every few years, once in a life time, or one may never encounter them at all.*

## Multi-Racial individuals
It is possible for many races to cross-breed, however the chances of successful reproduction are very low. Individuals referred to as [[Half-Elf]], [[Half-Orc]], or something of the like, are usually called this by whichever racial traits the bear the most of. Some races like [[Grung]] or [[Kenku]] are not capable of this form of reproduction. Those of multi-racial backgrounds have an even lower chance of reproducing, but it is still possible.

These beings rest in a socially complex status in terms of prejudice. Most people treat them as ordinary citizens of [[Zol]], but some pick and choose which racial backgrounds to acknowledge in order to justify their mistreatment of them.
