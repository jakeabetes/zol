*Note that the rarity of races is with respect to normal society in in [[The Prime]], in terms of encountering strangers Common races would be something most people see on the daily, Uncommon would be a few times in a week or month, Rare would be every few months or a year. In the greater scales of Very Rare or Extremely Rare it would likely be once every few years, once in a life time, or one may never encounter them at all.*
