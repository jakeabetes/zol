title: "The Wandering Gods"
---A group of powerful cosmic beings, alien to [[Zol]]. The wandering gods are heavily associated with [[The Undoing]]. Some believe they caused the event with the intention of taking [[Zol]] from the [[Zolaen Gods]], others believe that they came to protect [[Zol]] from future Undoing, as guardians who battle whatever truly caused it. Some believe they do not even exist.

By their own definition, [[The Wandering Gods]] do not seek dominion like most powerful beings. They claim to instead be teachers to both [[Gods]] and mortals alike. While this is the reason most of their followers seek their guidance, others believe it is a thinly veiled guise which their true conquest hides behind.

Unlike other [[Gods]], [[The Wandering Gods]] are defined by a moral rather than a domain. This is the lesson they claim to teach in an attempt to create a better, lasting world.

Name | Moral
------------ | ------------
[[The Iron Father]] | Dedication
[[The Ancestor]] | Origin
[[Agon and Ra'Queen]] | Oaths
[[The Ratking]] | Unrestraint
[[Cadence]] | Adaptability
[[Abaddon]] | Courage
[[Kaszu]] | Sagacity
[[The Raven Queen]] | Wit
[[Kinadhyne]] | Natural Order
[[Persanius]] | Compassion
[[Chorn]] | Patience 

While the wandering gods are not as powerful as many of the other [[Gods]] of [[Zol]] individually, they posses more coordination and cooperation than any other pantheon or alliance between divinities.

This close bond between all of [[The Wandering Gods]] lends them a great deal of agency in the world of [[Zol]], and [[The Cosmos]] beyond.

## The Goal of The Wandering Gods
The followers of [[The Wandering Gods]] believe their mission is to give mortals safety and agency in a world overpowered by [[Gods]]. They claim to wander the cosmos, protecting the worlds they find from the threats once faced in their home world.

Skeptics believe that this is a narrative told by [[The Wandering Gods]] to gather support in their true mission to dethrone the [[Zolaen Gods]] and take [[Zol]] for their own.

## The Realm of the Wandering Gods
The Wandering Gods all share a single realm known as [[The Unknown Realm]]. Each of them possesses their own domain within the realm that bears its own unique qualities.

## Symbolism
All wandering gods are identified by the same symbol, that of a question mark.

## Followers
Those who follow The Wandering Gods go by the name of Sworn Wanderers. There are not many who openly worship these gods and even fewer who define themselves as sworn wanderers.

Sworn wanderers seek to embody the moral of their chosen wandering god.

There are sub groups for each of the wandering gods, but the are known to frequently collaborate with one another.

## Minor or Major Deities?
Most [[Gods]] are categorized as either Minor or Major deities. The Wandering Gods are not fit well into this metric as academics are not aware of the extent of their power.

The Wandering Gods operate with an influence similar to that of Minor deities, but openly defy Major deities. Since they do not enact their will like other gods, it is difficult to judge their power. They do not seem to follow the rules most powerful beings do.
