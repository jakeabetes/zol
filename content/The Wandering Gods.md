# The Wandering Gods
A group of powerful cosmic beings, alien to [[Zol]]. The wandering gods are heavily associated with [[The Undoing]]. Some believe they caused the event with the intention of taking [[Zol]] from the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Others believe that they came to protect [[Zol]] from future Undoing, as guardians who battle whatever truly caused it.

By their own definition, [[The Wandering Gods]] do not seek dominion like most powerful beings. They claim to instead be teachers to both [[Gods]] and mortals alike. While this is the reason most of their followers seek their guidance, others believe it is a thinly veiled guise which their true conquest hides behind.

Unlike other [[Gods]], [[The Wandering Gods]] are defined by a moral rather than a domain. This is the lesson they claim to teach.

While the wandering gods are not as powerful as many of the other [[Gods]] of [[Zol]] individually, they posses more coordination and cooperation than any other pantheon or alliance between divinities.

This close bond between all of [[The Wandering Gods]] lends them a great deal of agency in the world of [[Zol]], and [[The Cosmos]] beyond.

## The Goal of The Wandering Gods
The followers of [[The Wandering Gods]] believe their mission is to give mortals safety and agency in a world overpowered by [[Gods]]. They claim to wander the cosmos, protecting the worlds they find from the threats once faced in their home world.

Skeptics believe that this is a narrative told by [[The Wandering Gods]] to gather support in their true mission to dethrone the [[Zolaen Gods]] and take [[Zol]] for their own.
