![[Kahdinacht.png]]

[[Kahdinacht]] has always been know for its beauty and refined culture. All 5 schools of arts are exemplified within the city 
- Visual
- Architectural 
- Literary
- Performance
- Culinary
The latter manifesting as world famous wines and spirits.

Gardens, shops, restaurants and theaters line its stone brick streets. Many noble houses in [[Laenwalde]] have had some form of property, be it home or vacationing spot, for as long as anyone can remember. When [[Audran]] was attacked by [[The Castle of Bodies]] on The Day of Madness, many nobles houses who survived fled to the coastal city of [[Kahdinacht]]. This consolidation of power within the kingdom led to the city becoming the defacto capital until [[Holocene]] was constructed.

## Authority
The city is ruled by High Lady Uraka Jirona, a ruler with deep pockets and a large army. Being the ruler of [[Kahdinacht]] comes with many gifts as the noble houses try and buy favor.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In the current day, the city is known mostly for exporting fine drinks that are sent all over The Three Corners of Civilization. Those who view the city more closely see its over-saturation with important nobles of [[Laenwalde]]. They know it to be a place of naturalistic study, and wild artisans.

## Historical Importance
Located within what was originally part of [[Gethsemane]], the region was a safe haven for a few tribes of peaceful [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] for a few hundred years, beginning around the year 3000. The safe haven was granted by the Wood [[Elves]] of [[Laelanor]], and was later given in full when the elves received aid from [[Gethsemane]] during the [[Western War]]. It was an act of kindness, but some believe the [[Elves]] never truly wanted any claim of it due to its latitude being largely equal to that of [[The East Mounts]]. When it was gifted, the tribes constructed the city of [[Kahdinacht]].

For many generations after the destruction of [[Audran]], [[Kahdinacht]] became the defacto capital of [[Laenwalde]]. It still sits high on a pedestal in [[Laenwalde]] culture because of this. 

## Other Things of Note
- The region of Lakeside is misnamed semi-intentionally. Some less educated migrants would occasionally call the shore 'the lake'. Nobility thought this was humorous and began to officially refer to that district as Lakeside.
