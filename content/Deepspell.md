Deepspell, the Arcane City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. Deepspell is home to a prosperous city, and the [[Kerketh Academy]]. The presence of the academy is what defines the city. Any and all who prove themselves qualified to learn at the academy can come to study [[Arcana]]. Given that they can afford the cost of tuition. The city's economy is based on the needs of the Academy. Be it supplies, amenities, or recreation.

[[Kerketh Academy]] is known for its ingenuity in the field of Artificing. Its [[Artificers]] are some of the best in the world.

## Authority
The city itself is governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] Lady Zed Dion, a very efficient and beautiful elf woman. Lady Dion is well liked by both the city and the academy as she manages the chaos that a population largely made up of foreign, magical students can bring.

The academy itself has its own rules and restrictions, and is overseen by The Arch Mages and The Magnate. The city and the academy work in harmony to keep a careful balance between the two entities. This functions well for the most part, but there are the occasional conflicts that vary in intensity.

The city is well protected by its garrison and vast magical resources.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws. Note that any crime already existing within the [[Alderian Laws]] that could are committed more efficiently via the usage of magic (assault, thievery, detrimental [[Necromancy]], etc.) are punished with a much higher severity than the other free cities.

| Restricted Production of Apparatum | Medium/High | Those who produce [[Apparatum]] of categories deemed dangerous by the academy without documented permission are punished. |

## Modern Importance
In the current day and age, [[Deepspell]] is known to create the best [[Apparatum]] in all of [[Zol]].

## Historical Importance
The city is extremely hard to take by siege due to its location and mages. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]] the city was only able to be taken by rebels because of students within the school that sympathized with their cause.

## Other Things of Note
- Many conspiracy theories exist about the academy. Some of which have truth to them:
	- The towers of the university reach up far beyond what you see from the outside. Containing 'pocket dimensions' that only the high ranking members of the school can reach
	- The academy is secretly connected to [[The Kybis Assembly]]'s campus in [[Archaic]] via underground tunnels
- The academy has a long standing rivalry with [[The Kybis Assembly]].
