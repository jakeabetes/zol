*The scarred city of Changelings*
![[Yorn Et Gaul Skyline.png]]

[[Yorn et Gaul]] was once the greatest city within [[The Glassius Reach]]. Famed for its adherence to [[The Pattern]], an extremely ordered way of living. The city was a bastion of the north. This sadly changed during the height of the [[Western War]] when the city was attacked and a relic called [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]], was lost. This object, central to the [[Changelings]] culture, has never been recovered. Most believe it was destroyed, but some think it was stolen by invading forces. Regardless, its absence has damaged the city's order and culture greatly. The city is now upon hard times, and has been for around half a centaury. Despite losing [[The Apex]], the people of [[Yorn et Gaul]] continue to revere the site where it was once held, attempting to maintain their ordered beliefs and society. However the empty pedestal that once held [[The Apex]] does not provide the grounds required for such a complex belief system. Regardless, it is still desperately worshiped by the city's people.

Now, the city is experiencing growing disorder and even crime. [[Changelings]] of [[Yorn et Gaul]] are beginning to lay down their old traditions. [[The Pattern]] has now become too cumbersome for many, and they are choosing to lead lives unguided by the many rules of their ancestors beliefs. The city's authority has attempted to rebalance things with little success.

On the opposite end of things, the fanatical members of society have begun to lash out in different ways. Some claim [[The Apex]]'s absence to be a test, and worship even more than the Changelings have done traditionally. Others strike out at those who deviate from the ways of old. Many groups have been formed to try and locate [[The Apex]], based on the idea that it was stolen.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city is an open wound on the world. While tragic, it gives a direct view into the heart of such a unique people and culture. Witnessing the daily life of [[Yorn et Gaul]] is like looking through geological layers of history all the way back to [[The Awakening]], and possibly even before. The [[Changelings]] have such a long standing, well documented history of their people. It begins when the [[Changelings]] found themselves in possession of [[The Oldshards]] after [[The Awakening]]. Bearing no knowledge of their past, they possessed a strange reverence and innate understanding of the relics, despite their lack of memories. All their traditions were built around them, and the removal of [[The Apex]] exposes the nature of [[Zol]] and its people in a very tangible way. It is also a place where [[Changelings]] can live unencumbered by an old religion, however they cannot do so without judgement. |
| Main Challenge | It is no secret that [[Yorn et Gaul]] struggles. Those who don't leave the city either cling to echoes of a fading past, or stray from their traditions into the bleak unknown. Disorder plagues its days, and there does not seem to be an end in sight. Many outsiders frequently ask why those who seek to maintain their traditions don't emigrate to [[Corinth]]. Some do, but in Changeling culture, the oldshard one is born near is thought to play a distinct role in ones life. They believe that the oldshard they are not attuned with cannot connect with them. |

| Shardwitnesses            | Religious/Political Station | Those elected to lead the city, and bear witness to the guidance of [[The Apex]]. However now that the city's oldshard is missing, this group now acts to guide and manage the city as best than can in its absence. They are a group that is formed of the most respected range of citizens, they live highly regulated lives by the rules of [[The Pattern]]. At their head sits the city's Shardcaller, Yemodhan Surrite. Shardwitnesses are similar in their influence to foreign nobility, but lead very strict and humble lifestyles. Those who become Shardwitnesses must be nominated many people (peers, mentors, and authorities) and also prove themselves by means of written essay, and engagement in political and philosophical debate.                                                                                             |
| The Public                | General populace            | The people of the city are faced with great social and political struggles. The systems established by [[The Pattern]] originally created much infrastructure for [[Changelings]] of all kinds, but with the loss of [[The Apex]] the people are divided. Some cling to what once was, others deviate into new ways of living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Members of [[The Eelynn]] | Academic Station            | Scholars and philosophers tasked with teaching and understanding the world. Specifically through the lens of [[The Oldshards]]. Members of this school pursue careers in magic, scholarship, and teaching. All people of the city from ages 8-15 participate in learning at [[The Eelynn]]. The school provides many levels of education, and is a repository of some of [[Zol]]'s most obscure knowledge due to its influences, and removal from the rest of the world. Some members of [[The Eelynn]] are rumored to be tasked with making long pilgrimages to distant lands, bearing changeling disguise, to return with knowledge not yet possessed by [[The Eelynn]]. The highest ranking members of [[The Eelynn]] are all Shardwitnesses. [[The Eelynn]] within [[Yorn et Gaul]] is facing unprecedented times without [[The Apex]] |
| Tarsects                  | Local authority             | A branch of local guard who are tasked with policing the very minute details of the [[Glassian Laws]]. They are not allowed to make arrests, but they are responsible for reporting infractions and doling out fines. Since [[Yorn et Gaul]]'s population has begun to deviate from [[The Pattern]], Tarsects are very controversial figures. Some appreciate their services, others hate them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Outsiders                 | Racial Group                | The few non-changeling members of society. In the whole city there are less than 15, and each of them has special permission to live within the city. Typically it is for some service they can provide to [[Yorn et Gaul]]. Their social lives are very delicate things as [[Changelings]] are not trusting of outsiders. [[Yorn et Gaul]] is a particularly dangerous place to outsiders, as some fanatics are violent towards them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Progressive Citizens      | Political Group             | Those changelings who seek a new way of life not dictated by [[The Pattern]]. The absence of [[The Apex]] has made a good portion of the population believe they do not need their lives to be so organized. Some are very normal citizens, some are careless (and possibly criminal), while others are fanatics. Making organized protests against the ways of old, or even taking full-blown criminal action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Conservative Citizens     | Political Group             | Those changelings who try and maintain, or restore the ways of old. These individuals adhere closely to [[The Pattern]]. They treat the holy site where [[The Apex]] was once held with the same reverence as if it were still there. Some are very normal citizens, while others are fanatical. Fanatics are known to cling to the ways of old even more than most citizens of [[Corinth]]. Some even go as far as taking violent action against those who deviate from tradition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| The Maezerat              | Militant Group              | A collection of fanatical [[Changelings]] who still believe [[The Apex]] survives. This sect of warriors organized within the city sends mercenaries far and wide in search for their lost relic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Still Changelings         | Misc                        | A group of some changelings who have been born around 500 years after the loss of [[The Apex]] who were not born with the capacity to change their appearance. About 1 in every 100 [[Changelings]] within [[Yorn et Gaul]] is born this way in modern day. Much folklore and fear surrounds these individuals, and they are typically outcasts from society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| The Formless              | Criminal                    | A small gang of very secretive criminals who have begun operating within [[Yorn et Gaul]], spawned by very fanatical, progressive changelings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These members go on to study magic, philosophy, and various other branches of academia. All of this study is viewed through the lens of [[The Oldshards]], and the worlds relationship to them. [[Yorn et Gaul]]'s branch of [[The Eelynn]] faces great challenges without [[The Apex]].                                                                      |

Surrite is commonly mocked as one of *The Unwitnessed*, a term used for rulers of [[Yorn et Gaul]] since the [[Western War]] and the loss of [[The Apex]]. Despite the city turmoil, Shard Witness Surrite has had a reasonable amount of success compared to their predecessors. They have a reputation for firm rule which has forced criminal activity deep into the shadows.

Along with Shard Witness Surrite, the Head Tarsect Lawrence Lostara is a very prevalent authority within the city. They are know as the Shard Witness' attack dog who cracks down on deviant behavior. The Head Tarsect is hated by many.  

Beyond that the city's military is formidable, as defense is a large concern for the city since the [[Western War]].

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Glassian Laws]], however enforcement is an issue within the city for minor crimes.

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Yorn et Gaul]] does not have much influence outside of its territory. It has the lesser economy within The Reach, and as a result does not export much. However within history and rumor it is a place of frequent mention. Some talk about the hardships it faces, while others talk about it as a hive of evil where the good kingdoms of the west prevailed.

## Historical Importance
Once the greatest kingdom of The Reach, [[Yorn et Gaul]] is now mostly known for its great losses sustained during the [[Western War]].

## Destruction of Yorn Et Gaul
During the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Some evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]]. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would be called the [[Western War]].

The [[Changelings]] were outnumbered greatly, but they proved a very difficult foe due to their strange environment, and the fact that they can manifest in any physical, humanoid form.

The clashing of kingdoms stretched on for just over one hundred years, before the attackers were able to lay siege on [[Yorn et Gaul]]. The destruction was swift and brutal once the gate fell. Many changelings adopted disguising forms and fled the city. 

Once the dust settled it was realized that [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]], was destroyed (however some think that it was stolen). At this time, it was seeming like [[The Glassius Reach]] would soon be conquered. This changed when a [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin entered the fray.

Ehmalog, Word of Wrath came to the aid of [[The Glassius Reach]]. It is not known why he did this, nor where he came from. The [[Wordbearer]]'s capacity for killing was like no other. He single-handedly slaughtered the invaders armies in droves. Even Faraday, Word of Armaments could not defeat him.

The invaders armies were forced to withdraw. [[Yorn et Gaul]] was retaken by [[Changelings]]. However the city's wound, its loss of [[The Apex]], would never heal.

Even to this day Ehmalog, Word of Wrath, is said to stalk the mountain pass in a tract of land called the [[Wrath Wastes]]. He kills those he deems trespassers of [[The Glassius Reach]]. None know why he does this for the [[Changelings]], but without his aid they would have surely fallen.

## Other Things of Note
- The city is the nearest of all to [[Holyfield]], and as a result has much folklore about it. This includes things like strange people called 'Nots' who come to the city and steal away children and bring them to [[Holyfield]]. Others think the place where spirits go until they are reborn. Regardless it is avoided by most.
- The city does utilize [[Apparatum]], however its disconnection from the outside world has made it difficult for [[The Glassius Reach]] to keep up with the advancements in technique and skills involved in the [[Artificers]] practice.
