---## Destruction of Yorn Et Gaul
During the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Some evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]]. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would be called the [[Western War]].

The [[Changelings]] were outnumbered greatly, but they proved a very difficult foe due to their strange environment, and the fact that they can manifest in any physical, humanoid form.

The clashing of kingdoms stretched on for just over one hundred years, before the attackers were able to lay siege on [[Yorn et Gaul]]. The destruction was swift and brutal once the gate fell. Many changelings adopted disguising forms and fled the city. 

Once the dust settled it was realized that [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]], was destroyed (however some think that it was stolen). At this time, it was seeming like [[The Glassius Reach]] would soon be conquered. This changed when a [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin entered the fray.

[[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]] came to the aid of [[The Glassius Reach]]. It is not known why he did this, nor where he came from. The [[Wordbearer]]'s capacity for killing was like no other. He single-handedly slaughtered the invaders armies in droves. Even [[Faraday, Word of Armaments]] could not defeat him.

The invaders armies were forced to withdraw. [[Yorn et Gaul]] was retaken by [[Changelings]]. However the city's wound, its loss of [[The Apex]], would never heal.

Even to this day [[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]], is said to stalk the mountain pass in a tract of land called the [[Wrath Wastes]]. He kills those he deems trespassers of [[The Glassius Reach]]. None know why he does this for the [[Changelings]], but without his aid they would have surely fallen.
