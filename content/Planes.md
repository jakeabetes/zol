# The Planes of Zol
[[Zol]] itself is a parent realm. A plane which contains many other planes all anchored to a [[Prime Material Plane]]. The sheer number of planes in [[Zol]] is not known. Planar travel poses many challenges, and most mortals know little of anything outside the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Despite this, the powerful and arcane citizens of [[Zol]] have recorded a fair deal about the [[Planes]].

[[Planes]] were first created from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. [[The Watcher]] did not change the majority of the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]], but did manage to harness a great deal of it. What is left of the [[Sea of Monsters]] is now known as [[The Void]].

All planes in [[Zol]] are are anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]], which is the resting place of [[The Trinity]], and home to The Three Corners of Civilization.

All planes float amongst [[The Ethos]], the local section of the universe that stops at [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Beyond that lies [[The Cosmos]] which spans on forever.

## List of All Planes
There are many planes in [[Zol]]. Below is the list of known major planes.
- **The Mortal Planes** - Planes bound by the rule of [[The Mortal Coil]]
	- [[Prime Material Plane]] - The heart of [[Zol]] and resting place of [[The Trinity]]. Being the source of all magical power, and the anchor for all other planes, it is the focal point for all of [[Zol]].
	- [[Fey]]
		- A fantastical reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where nature an beauty run rampant. While enticing, the [[Fey]] is very dangerous.
	- [[Fell]]
		- A dark and mysterious reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where shadows and thorns grow from a hauntingly beautiful, and extremely dangerous landscape.
	- [[The Elemental Planes]]
		- The fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], where the elemental forces of nature stop overlapping one another. Appearing on diagrams like the drawing of a child who has colored outside of the lines. [[The Elemental Planes]] jut out of the [[Prime Material Plane]] creating worlds that solely embody a single aspect of nature. They are strange realms rarely traversed by foreigners.
- **The Outer Planes** - Planes that are not bound by [[The Mortal Coil]]
	- [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]
		- The Castle of [[The Watcher]] and his close allies
	- [[The Moons]]
		- A group of ancient planets that once existed freely in [[The Cosmos]], but were consumed by [[Goh'zul]]. Before he could fully digest them, he was defeated. Leaving a set of strange ruined worlds that orbit one another in [[Zol]]'s sky.
		- [[The Forgotten Heavens]]
			- A subplane of [[The Moons]]. The once abandoned divine plane attached to these ancient worlds. Now inhabited by [[The Night Empress]] and her court.
	- [[The Palace of Drole]]
		- An endless palace inhabited by [[Yanneran]] and his chosen dead. A place of constant celebration and art.
	- [[Limbo]]
		- Where the fateless dead are sent by [[The Coilwalker]] to have their future determined.
	- [[Absurdia]]
		- One of the most bizarre aspects of [[Zol]]. It is described as a sort of parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Its inhabitants are very odd, and those that travel to it tell tales of strange events that almost sound like comical children's stories mixed with accounts of great violence.
	- [[The Unknown Realm]]
		- The home of [[The Wandering Gods]]
	- [[The Immortal Ocean]]
		- A realm of only water and light, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant. Accessible only to those who are not invited by its ruler [[Ohlit]].
	- [[The Pure Forest]]
		- A beautiful infinitely spanning forest brought into existence by [[The Lifeweaver]]'s presence, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant.
	- [[Elm Manor]]
		- The artificial plane constructed by [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].
	- [[The Storm Horizon]]
		- The origin of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s storms.
- **Unique Planar Manifestations** - Planes, or things very similar to planes, that have their own set of rules that is unique to them.
	- [[The Void]]
		- The Remnants of the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The size and scope of [[The Void]] is not know by even the [[Gods]]. It exists directly underneath the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It contains evils incomprehensible to mortals, and is only held back by the efforts of the [[Zolaen Gods]].
		- [[Damnation]]
			- A subplane of [[The Void]]. It is an amalgamation of all hells ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], and is ruled by the terrifying demon [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is accessible in the deepest darkest caverns that span at the bottom of [[The Underdark]].
	- [[The Ethos]]
		- The space that surrounds all of [[Zol]]'s planes. It is essentially the lack of a plane. The whole universe exists floats amongst this manifestation of reality, [[The Ethos]] is merely the local section of it.
		- [[The Ethos]] is also bound by [[The Mortal Coil]].
	- [[The Cosmos]]
		- What lies beyond [[The Ethos]] and [[The Great Wall of Roots]].
	- [[The Ethereal Plane]]
		- Not truly a plane at all. Some call it The Cognitive Realm, others call it The Plane of Souls. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is the wavelength of reality that souls exist on. It overlaps all of [[Zol]]. It is possible to interface directly with [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even travel through it.
	- [[Oblivion]]
		- The heart of [[Goh'zul]]. Little is known about [[Oblivion]]. Scripture talks of it being the battle ground between [[The Watcher]] and [[The Wretch]]. It is said to have a sole entrance called simply *The Door*, and is thought to still contain what little is left of [[Goh'zul]].
	- [[The Space Outside Reality]]
		- What lies beyond [[The Cosmos]]. Also known as The Far Realm.

## Subplanes
Subplanes are planes that are created within another plane. They inherit all the rules their parent plane subscribes to.

Example: [[Artificers]] create the common [[Apparatum]] known as a Bag of Holding. This device is a fabric sac that contains a portal to an artificial plane that merely contains space for storing objects. If this Bag of Holding is brought to the [[Prime Material Plane]] the space inside the bag is bound to [[The Mortal Coil]], if it is brought to [[Absurdia]] it is not.

## The two types of Planes: Planets and Realms
A planet is a discrete, usually spherical plane that floats freely amongst [[The Cosmos]]. [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] are a good example of this. Planets typically have some central point of gravity that keeps objects on its surface. Planets do not usually have other planes bound to them in any way other than gravitational orbit of other planets.

Realms are planes that are not necessarily discrete and do not have to subscribe to Euclidean Geometry. They may be infinite, repeating, fractal, or end abruptly at their edges.

In [[The Cosmos]], Parent realms are usually discerned by some sort of barrier between them and the rest of the universe. They typically contain many lesser planes bound to a [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as their own local section of [[The Cosmos]] similar to [[The Ethos]].

Planets can exist on their own or within a realm. Realms are rarely contained by a planet, but Realms usually contain other realms.

## Artificial Planes
Planes that are not found already existing in [[Zol]] are called Artificial Planes. They are newly created, and typically temporary in the cosmic scale.

They can manifest at any size and can be produced intentionally or by wild magic. The can exist as planets or realms.

Constructing a plane intentionally is very difficult and requires immense skill. The size, specifications, and permanency of the plane depends on the ability of the creator.

A good example of this is the plane of [[Elm Manor]], home to [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].
