title: "Keepships"
---[[Keepships]] are unique, magical seafaring vessels of immense size. The carry small cities on their back, and seem to have a consciousness of their own. By all accounts, a keepship should not be able to stay afloat, let alone sail. The magic behind [[Keepships]] are a complete mystery to academia, and many seek the secrets to their creation. The three [[Keepships]] that were discovered were found shortly after [[The Awakening]]. Each hosts a few thousand inhabitants, and a unique culture. The ships set a course of their own, meaning the consciousness held within the ship dictates its path. The ships are known to spend their time within [[The Vast Sea]], and occasionally swing by cities so their inhabitants can conduct trade. Often when a keepship does this, many merchant boats will pull up alongside it like some strange form of a pop up market.

The ships each have their own form of governance. A Keep Captain rules the people, but no one can command the ships themselves. Some who hail from the keepship's claim to hear the ships voice, they talk about the ships almost as if they were small [[Gods]]. These accounts, which are shared on all of the ships, are the origin for each of their names as inhabitants claim to have heard it spoken to them. Laws are not formally placed on the ships, but the governing bodies do impose unwritten rules that the citizens are very familiar with. These rules echo what would be seen in most foreign cities. Things like murder, fraud, and thievery are outlawed. 

Beyond their amazing ability to sail, [[Keepships]] also posses a few other wonderous features. The first of which is an automatic defense system. The consciousness of the ship can sense threats, and its cannons will fire on any hostility. They are remarkably adept at combat too, so most threats steer clear of them. The ship also provides accommodations like plumbing, and magical lighting. The final trait they posses is the ability to repair/grow portions of the ship in a matter of days. The Keepships will grow almost like a closing wound, or expand its size to accommodate a growing population. The latter occurs rarely, and is usually on a small scale.

## The Aubrican

The most populated of the [[Keepships]]. The Aubrican is known for its eclectic, scrappy citizens. The ship is packed with small makeshift coffin-homes to accommodate its overgrown population. It has a loose governing power, headed by Keep Captain Sharn Swallow. Keep Captain Swallow is an old, portly human man who was able to make himself the ships leading power due to his vast economic resources as a previous life spent as a merchant. However many do not like the Keep Captain, and crime and disorder is a common occurrence on the ship. However not all is grim on The Aubrican. Its inhabitants are known for their music and celebration.

## The Eebezan

The smallest, and most orderly of the [[Keepships]]. The Eebezan is a marvel to [[Artificers]] as it is completely made of stone, yet floats as if it were of a much lighter material. Its Keep Captain, Relza Ghonne is a young and sharp minded half elven woman. She managed to strike order on a keepship (a thing few have achieved), and garnered the respect of many for it. The Eebezan has the most strict rules of the trio. To board the ship one must be invited, or cleared by the ships guard. Gaining citizenship is fathoms more difficult. The whole ship operates like a healthy inner-city district.

## The Khal Netresser

The cursed Keepship. The Khal Netresser is thought by many to be haunted, or cursed. It lives under the tyrannical rule of Keep Captain Arth K'vett, an intimidating aarakocra woman. Strange things occur on this vessel. Many wonder why its inhabitants do not flee the ship, however sociology dictates that most people fear leaving the life they know. The other [[Keepships]] fear it as when they pass each other (a rare occurrence), the other ships fire on The Khal Netresser.
