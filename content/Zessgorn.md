Zessgorn was founded by a nomadic people, called [[The Tarot]]. These people, made up of a diverse set of individuals, would travel all across Zol in different clans. Drawing from sacred decks called [[Tarot Cards]]. Attempting to read the fates to determine the best path for their people. On what is now known as [[The Tarot Convergence]], all of these clans were led to the same spot on the same day. It was there they founded Zessgorn.

A set of rings were forged to represent the card, [[The Rings of Tarot]]. The bearers of these rings were meant to act as leaders of Zessgorn, and avatars of the fates. In recent history they have become a resource people will do dark things for.

Zessgorn is a beautiful costal city, it is known for its plethora of colorful tapestries that are strewn all about its city, gorgeous beaches, and [[Skytrack]] that carries passengers from the lower city to the keep.

## Zessgorn's Strange Culture
