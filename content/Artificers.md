title: "Artificers"
---# Artificers

Magical crafters who bend the fundamental powers of [[Zol]] into their own creations. The creations can take many forms but largely fall into the three categories of [[Iron Light]], [[Imbuement Perpetuum]], and Natural Materials.

Artificers will use their creations to give themselves, or another, means beyond what they would normally be able to accomplish. Be it a tool, transportation, weapon, or defense.

The typical forms of artificary are:
- Engineering - utilizing craftsmanship and mathematics to create technology.
- [[Alchemy]] - utilizing magical and scientific techniques to combine substances to create something greater than the sum of their parts.
- [[Iron Light]] - the most common craft. Iron utilizes simple runes formed into complex designs to leverage a user's [[Vizir]].
- [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] - the most complicated and powerful form of artificary.
These methods are frequently used together for superior results, but the resulting component is usually identified by the most difficult aspect of its making.
