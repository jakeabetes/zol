# Artificers

Magical crafters who bend the fundamental powers of [[Zol]] into their own creations. The creations can take many forms but largely fall into the three categories of [[Iron Light]], [[Grand Forces]], and Natural Materials.

Artificers will use their creations to give themselves, or another, means beyond what they would normally be able to accomplish. Be it a tool, transportation, weapon, or defense.

The typical forms of artificary are:
- [[Iron Light]] - the most common craft. Iron utilizes simple runes formed into complex designs to leverage a user's [[Vizir]].
- [[Grand Forces]] - the most complicated and powerful form of artificary.
- Natural Materials - the utilization of base materials that are inherently magical to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts. This craft can be very simple in some cases, or very complex in others. Those who perform this art may not identify as artificers either. They may be blacksmiths, alchemists, or some other craftsmen.
These methods are frequently used together for superior results, but the resulting component is usually identified by the most difficult aspect of its making.
