title: "Artificers"
---Magical crafters who bend the fundamental powers of [[Zol]] into their own creations. The creations can take many forms but largely fall into the four categories of Engineering, [[Alchemy]], [[Iron Light]], and [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].

Artificers will use their creations to give themselves, or another, means beyond what they would normally be able to accomplish. This creation may manifest as a tool, pharmaceutical,  transportation, weapon, or defense.

The typical forms of artificary are:
- Engineering - utilizing craftsmanship, natural materials, and mathematics to create technology.
- [[Alchemy]] - utilizing magical and scientific techniques to break down, and re-combine substances to create something greater than the sum of their parts.
- [[Iron Light]] - the most common craft. Iron utilizes simple runes formed into complex designs to leverage a user's [[Vizir]].
- [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] - the most complicated and powerful form of artificary. It involves permanently imbuing an object with magic far beyond the power of [[Iron Light]]
These methods are frequently used together for superior results, but the resulting component is usually identified by the most difficult aspect of its making.
