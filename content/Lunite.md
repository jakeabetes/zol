## Description
A myth amongst mortals, [[Lunite]] are said to be an ancient magical people who live amongst the civilizations of [[The Prime]]. Said to appear similarly to [[Humans]] with dark hair and very pale skin that appear slightly *off* upon close inspection. They are said to look as if they do not belong despite bearing no jarring physical characteristics, and to hold the phase of Majesty (one of [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]]) in their eyes.

Few academic records of their nature exist, but many stories talk of them being from a secret world held within [[The Moons]]. Others talk of them being a unique and rare type of [[Fey]] creature. Unfortunately, little is known about them.
