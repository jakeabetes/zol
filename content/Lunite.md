## Description
A myth amongst mortals, [[Lunite]] are said to be an ancient magical people who live amongst the civilizations of [[The Prime]]. Said to appear similarly to [[Humans]] with dark hair and very pale skin that appear slightly *off* upon close inspection. They are said to look as if they do not belong despite bearing no jarring physical characteristics, save for the fact that the phase of Majesty (one of [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]]) can be seen in their eyes upon close inspection.

Few academic records of their nature exist, but many stories talk of them being from a secret world held within [[The Moons]]. Others talk of them being a unique and rare type of [[Fey]] creature. Unfortunately, little is known about them.
