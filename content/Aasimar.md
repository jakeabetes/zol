## Description
Beings born with celestial blood. Academics, historians, and churches all disagree about the exact nature of [[Aasimar]], and some do not even believe that they truly exist. However at the core of the narrative lies a common thread: [[Aasimar]] are said to be beings who have had some divine influence in their birth. This may be due to the will of a god, or due to a parents copulation with a divine entity. The former is considered to be more far-fetched, but the narrative exists in many myths and legends.

[[Aasimar]] appear as ordinary members of one of [[Zol]]'s [[Races]], however they hold a great power within them. Some are blessed with [[Magic]] power, and some even manifest angelic wings, or other boons of power.
