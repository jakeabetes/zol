---# Zelatt, The Draconic Amalgam
*Void God of Chaos, Major Deity*
![[Zelatt.png]]

A hauntingly beautiful force of chaos. Zelatt is the mother of all [[Chromatic Dragons]]. She is an ever-flowing being of scales, bone, and magnificent color. Birthing powerful dragons from parts of her body that break off, Zelatt and her children seek lawlessness and destruction for [[Zol]].

## Depiction
A colossal, everchanging mass of color. Zelatt's body is made up of fractals that resemble the body parts of dragons. At the center of her form is a massive maw.

## Symbolism
2 conjoined dragon wings rotated opposite to one another.

## Behavior
Zelatt herself lives through her children and their descendants, her physical body existing more as a sort of elemental force or hive mind.

She has the capacity to enter the minds of mortals like many other gods, but rarely uses her own physical form for anything other than a means of production.

## Realm
Zelatt resides in [[The Void]].

## Worshipers
Many people seek Zelatt's favor by carrying out her will. She lends magical ability to mortals more than any of the other [[Void Gods]] in record.

Many nefarious cults in recorded history are based around her draconic rule, typically manifesting as a group of mortals serving one of her powerful dragons.
