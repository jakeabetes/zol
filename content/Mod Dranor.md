title: "Mod Dranor"
---*The Great Dwarven City*
![[Mod Dranor groundline.png]]

Hand carved by thousands of careful, skilled, and determined dwarven hands. [[Mod Dranor]] is one of the largest cities in [[Zol]]. It is a subterranean marvel of carved stone and expertly crafted infrastructure. Located deep in the heart of of the great mountain, [[Kalamdola]], the city spans three massive caverns within the mountain.

The city is divided into three main sub-cities: 
- **Providence** - The central sub-city of Dwarven Honor. At its entrance lies the Great Stone Door, the main entrance to the city. At the center of Providence lies the beautiful palace of Keep Dranor. Its north road leads to Timber Forge, its east road leads to Watchers Crest, and its south road leads to The Great Stone Door![[mod_dranor_-_providence.png]] 

- **Watcher's Crest** - The deepest part of Mad Dranor. This section of city does not allow outsiders, as its grounds are considered to be holy amongst dwarves as it was the first place [[Mythril]] was discovered. It is also where most of the city's mining operations are based. ![[mod_dranor_-_watchers_crest.png]]

- **Timber Forge** - The sub-city of dwarven craft. Timber Forge is not directly attached to the city's main entrance, but it is the closest to the surface. This is because of the Raven Tower. A large structure that spans from the cavern's floor to the ceiling, with a large lift in it's center. The Raven Tower serves the purpose of moving resources from the surface down into the city. Most notably timber and agricultural goods.![[mod_dranor_-_timber_forge.png]]

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city is ancient, and all throughout its existence [[Dwarves]] have lived and died for its glory. The care and dedication put into their city and culture is so deeply founded it is one of the pivots that the history of [[Zol]] itself is turned upon. Within the city one can find some of the most skilled craftsmen in all of [[The Three Corners]], as well as ancient histories and even secrets dating all the way back to [[The Awakening]].  |
| Main Challenge | [[Dwarves]] are famously stubborn, and a city founded on literal ages of stubbornness is bound to have its problems. While orderly and grand, [[Mod Dranor]] has rivalries between dwarven houses, and even rivalries between sub-cities at times. These conflicts vary in their intensity, but have come to blows in the past. |

| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Great Houses                | Social Class      | The Dwarven families of the highest reputation. These Dwarves act as the nobility of the city. Unlike the nobility of many other cultures, members of great houses associate with common citizens with a high degree of regularity. Their culture does not put them in a position of power over common citizens like it does in foreign cities. It is more that they are viewed with a greater respect, and they come from a line of very notable dwarves. However it should be said that some individual dwarves do look down on others in this manner, but it is not a significant cultural influence. The heads of these families all sit on The Dwarven Council who aide The King in his duties. The amount of great houses varies over the years, but tends to hover around 10 to 15 families. |
| The Common People               | Social Class      | The Vast Majority. These dwarves are the general population of the city. There is a spectrum of economical divide in the city, but it is no where near as wide as what exists in many other cities. Even the least fortunate are able to have standard comforts. The young, sick, and elderly who do not posses a means to an end are taken care of as well. Dwarven pride and honor is extremely important to these people, and will welcome any respectful guest with open arms. This hospitality increases exponentially to any dwarven visitor not originally from [[Mod Dranor]]. There is a common dwarven saying *"Und Untalsaie"* which translates to *"You are home now"*, a commonly used greeting to dwarves who visit or emigrate to the city.           |
| Local Elves                     | Racial Group      | A small population of local [[Elves]] reside within [[Mod Dranor]]. They are allowed homes within the city by laws written into [[The Elven-Dwarven Concord]]. Many reside here as political ambassadors, or as craftsmen with specific interests in the practices of [[Dwarves]]. These individuals are however, not allowed in Watcher's Crest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Local Non-Dwarves and Non-Elves | Racial Group      | The very small population of locals who reside in the city that are not [[Dwarves]] or [[Elves]]. To gain this sort of citizenship in [[Mod Dranor]] is extremely difficult, unless you have a dwarven spouse. It requires direct permission from the Dwarven Council. These individuals are however, not allowed in Watcher's Crest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Slaves                          | Social Class      | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. Slaves typically reside in farming or lumber camps above Timber Forge. Made up mostly of captured thieves and bandits. Dwarves are not allowed to be made into slaves. There are a small group of slaves who serve families within the city, and are treated considerably well for slave standards across [[The Three Corners]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Citizens of Providence          | Local Sub-Culture | Dwarves known for being a little-self important. Whenever the city as a whole faces hardship, providence usually ensures it is the best taken care of as it is the 'city-center'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Citizens of Timber Forge        | Local Sub-Culture | Dwarves know for leading a 'slow-life'. Farmers, lumber workers, hunters, and craftspersons. Hard workers that those of the political center, and deeper mining operations view as their own local version of the [[Halflings]] from [[Woogis]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Citizens of Watcher's Crest     | Local Sub-Culture | Those of the [[Mythril]] sub-city are typically seen as religious fanatics, or gruff miners. The stereotype of a person from Watcher's Crest is either a white robed cleric, or a dirt-covered miner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| House Gherzeram                 | Great House       | The great house of The Kings family, known for ruling Mod Dranor for many generations. The houses head is King Donnis Gherzeram himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| House Mireen                    | Great House       | The house of trade. House Mireen manages much of the export and import of most things [[The Iron Tracks]] bring to and from the city. Headed by Lady Larza Mireen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Authority

The City's army is a fearsome one, known for its extreme resilience and fine armaments.

## Modern Importance
In modern day, [[Mod Dranor]] is a very famed city. It exports many resources like rare metals, or finely made tools and armaments across [[The Three Corners]]. Many common folk view it with awe, as the great dwarven city is deeply set within myth and rumor. However many also know it personally as it is the only city within [[Gethsemane]] that is easily accessible via [[The Iron Tracks]].

## Historical Importance
In the past, [[Mod Dranor]] has been known for withstanding the greatest test of time. It stood strong against powerful [[Dragons]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Its Great Stone Door kept much of the [[Beast Ire]] plague at bay, and its powerful armies fought bravely against [[The Illithid Invasion]].

Its allies benefitted greatly from their military support during the [[Triumvirate Battles]] and the [[Western War]]. Despite their short stature, the [[Dwarves]] of [[Mod Dranor]] stand tall in the history books.

## Other Things of Note
- [[Mod Dranor]] bears no specific colors, however the city is so distinct and well known that its exports, people, and armies are easy to distinguish without it
- Slavery is practiced within the city, but they are not allowed to work within the mines, or workshops of the city
