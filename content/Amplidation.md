title: "Amplidation"
---[[Amplidation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is an uncommon school. It is magic that involves the manipulation of physics, like gravitation, friction, or inertia.

[[Amplidation]] is quite difficult as it requires the user to not only create new physical properties, but lessen or completely sever their targets connection to the physical properties of [[Zol]]. The latter takes an extremely high degree of accuracy and training to perfect.

Most commonly, Amplidation is used to manipulate gravitational [[energy]]. There are 4 different types of gravitational bindings using [[Sympathetic bonds]]. These are:
- Objective Ties
	- Causing a target to have gravity towards another
- Directional Ties
	- Causing a target to have gravity in a set direction
- Wells
	- Causing a target to pull or repel everything in its vicinity

Other manifestations are
- Frictional Manipulations
	- Causing a target to experience increased or decreased effects of friction
- Inertial Flip
	- Causing a still object to begin moving with ease, or stop a moving object. The mass and energy behind an object increase the difficulty of this.
In all of these cases, a [[Caster]] can control the amount of forces that are influencing their target based on their skill.

These bindings are temporary, usually lasting minutes unless maintained by a [[Caster]] or some artificed mechanism.
