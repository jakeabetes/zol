title: "Godkiller Chapter Summary - 15 - Mixed Reaction"
---
- **Chapter begins on the early morning on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**
- Our heroes set off early in a hopeful march towards the Guild Courtyard with hopes to be chosen to compete in The First Ring. The entry level fighting competition in The Tournament of the Brave.
- Tensions were high amongst prospective competitors, and there were *many* hopeful teams in the square.
- Our heroes were chosen amongst eight other teams. Each selected by a board of sponsors and merchants. Supposedly teams were picked based on how they will draw a crowd. The Street Dogs were likely chosen due to their controversial connection to the 1-5 Potentium investigation.
- For the same reason, Coinge's Lot was chosen. The team had been selected and sponsored by none other then Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge himself. The investigator who named the party as suspects in his investigation of the train robbery.
- The Street Dogs were provisioned and sequestered within a lounge for the day. Their only connection to the outside world beyond their fights would be Professor Abby.
- The old, jovial guild mind met you at your upper floor room. Upright, and unbound by his wheelchair. The Professor was sporting auto-mail legs. An apparatum that granted the paraplegic man the ability to walk.
- The change, and the manner Old Abby was carrying himself with sparked a question. Why was the professor treated unfairly by some amongst the guild?
- Old Abby explained to you that he had a reputation. A tendency to explore anything an everything. His need for discovery outweighed his caution. His tenacity had gotten him into a lot of trouble. He originally sought out the guild in hopes to find like-minded people, or at least friends who could withstand his bad luck.
	- Specifically in relation to the tournaments, his Lot never even made it past the first round. Old Abby was bad luck.
- The Professor explained his role in the coming day. He would be able to relay you information about the fights as he saw them. Unfortunately, your place within the bracket made you the first team to compete in every iteration of the arena. You would be going in blind.
- You were brought down to a facility below the arena, bound to your Blood Well and broken off into pairs. Each pair was sent to an elevator.
- The sky above the area was blinding as your platforms raised. The crowds were a deafening blend of cheers and boos. A mixed reaction. Sherman in particular was a target for negativity.
- You found yourselves in an obstacle course like space. The crowd, a safe distance away up steeply slanted walls.
- Amongst the audience you spotted some notable faces.
	- Scattered in the general seating you noticed Cliff Guntry, a familiar looking fortuneteller dressed in purple, and a tiefling man who looked a bit like Johnny Dogs.
	- In the Guild Pit you noticed Chapter Frond, Spinner, Persephone Drone, and a confused looking Bennet Frence.
	- Amongst the finer seats, reserved for guild minds you saw Master Willem Bellard, Master Colin Coinge, and of course Old Abby.
	- Then there was the most dramatic section. Reserved for VIPs. Within you saw the two most politically powerful figures in the city for the first time. Lady Helseena Trodak, Alderian Seat of Tenzentak and Helg Corsair, Guild Master of The Bladehammer Guild. Next to Helg were his two twin offspring, Adja and Bax. You also spotted the esteemed guest Haith Nallian sitting next to a huge, imposing, empty chair. At the far edge of the VIP Section, you was Lord Curtis Renaull accompanied by Lady Kalimae Sky of all people. As strange as the sight was, the man sitting behind them was far more distracting. Still as a statue, and wearing a pristine, white body covering, the man had a distinctive silver mask that caught the sun like a sword.
- The fight began with an explosion of movement. Your competitors, Falk's Six, proved to be admirable foes.
- The arena itself was a participant in the fight, filled with traps and secrets to explore.
	- The party discovered toppling towers
	- A secret passage in the bottom of the central pit
	- And a key that damaged the opposing side's Blood Well.
- The fight consisted of skilled martial arts, the clever use of spells, a giant tortle, and mind controlling magic employed by both sides of the fight.
- Our heroes emerged victorious after Rozwald snuck out a secret hatch and blasted away the last of the opposing side's Blood Well.
- Whatever haters of yours remained in the audience were drowned out by cheers. The metal faced man in the VIP section was particularly watchful of your group. And your foes proved to be mostly good-sports.
- Celebrations were had in the lounge, and congratulations were given by Old Abby who told you he'd report back on the other teams before your next fight.
- Amongst the excited chatter of victory a small, important moment occurred. Our heroes spoke of their group's future, and their tavern. They spoke of it with Mallory included.
- **Chapter ends on the early afternoon on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**
