title: "Pale Lift"
---
A Lift that is actively being constructed between [[Holocene]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. It aims to be a great improvement to [[Gilligan's Lift]], however its construction has been constantly stalled due to political reasons. Many think it is a project that is intentionally unfinished for political control within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].
