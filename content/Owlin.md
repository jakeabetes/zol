## Description
Frequently mistaken for [[Aarakocra]], [[Owlin]] are owl like beings. They are physiologically distinct from [[Aarakocra]], as they bear different beaks, talons, and neck musculature which allows them to rotate their heads 180 degrees.

[[Owlin]] are few in number, and typically peaceful creatures. They tend to reside in cold climates, leading druidic lifestyles. Many compare them to [[Wood Elves]] in terms of disposition.
