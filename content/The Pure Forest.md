Boundless, uncorrupted and wild. [[The Pure Forest]] is an infinite forest that spills off of [[The Lifeweaver]]'s form.

Many beasts and other free spirited beings reside in [[The Pure Forest]] unbound by the laws of society.

[[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] and his court also make home in this realm.
