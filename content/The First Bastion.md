[[The First Bastion]] is technically an institution of [[The University]] as part of the [[Observum]]. However it often acts on its own accord. Located within the beautiful city of [[Penthe]], [[The First Bastion]] is known to train warriors, devout to their kingdom and the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Many see the members of [[The First Bastion]] as righteous protectors. Others see them as self righteous war-dogs.

The campus itself is a large cathedral, surrounded by training grounds, barracks, classrooms, libraries, and The Hall of Feasts. It is a prestigious place to gain ones training, but a person can only do so if the [[Zolaen Gods]] give them a boon of their power.

## Admission
Gaining entrance to [[The First Bastion]] is no easy task. Once per year, on the first day of spring, the school opens its grounds to those who would prove themselves worthy fighters. The event is called The Bastion's Tourney, and those who win events or prove themselves worthy in another manner are admitted. They have one year to prove themselves capable of channeling the [[Zolaen Gods]] power through the will of [[Observance]]. If they can do so, they will spend the rest of their lives in its ranks. otherwise they are expelled, never to return.

## Leadership
The school is run by the Bladelords. Headed by Blade Lord Kive Bidell. These individuals respond only to the rule of [[King Tatelak II]], and the [[Zolaen Gods]].
