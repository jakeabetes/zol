## Description
The [[Beast Ire]] plague began as boons of power from [[Kerndall]]. However the lust for power that burdened many mortals turned it into a corrupting force of darkness. However not all succumbed to the temptations of power. Those who stayed true to themselves became [[Beastfolk]] when the [[Beast Ire]] plague was overcome.

[[Beastfolk]] are a very diverse cast of people who share traits with beasts. Some beast folk appear very animal-like, called *Full-Bloods*. While others appear more akin to the more ordinary races of [[Zol]] (dwarves, elves, humans, halflings, et cetera) and can change their form to be more animal like at will. These are called *Shifters*. The range of these bestial forms is very broad. Given compatible sexual characteristics, [[Beastfolk]] can mate with an person. The resulting offspring will also be a [[Beastfolk]] of one of the parents bestial heritages. The chance of it being a full-blood or a shifter is fifty-fifty.

Some of the known bestial heritages are:
- Canine
- Ursidae
- Cervidae
- Reptilian
- Rodent
- Et Cetera

Often the name [[Beastfolk]] will be adapted to better fit the charactristics of an individual such as: Ratfolk, Bearfolk, et cetera.

There is however a common confusion that causes much discourse in [[Zol]]. [[Beastfolk]] are a product of [[Speciatum Magica]], the product of magical happenstance that produces a whole race of beings. Before [[Beastfolk]] came to exist, many other animal like beings existed. These races now get commonly referred to as [[Beastfolk]], but are in fact physiologically, culturally, and historically different from [[Beastfolk]]. These [[Races]] are:
- [[Harengon]]
- [[Tabaxi]]
- [[Aarakocra]]
- [[Owlin]]
- [[Kenku]]
- [[Grung]]
- [[Triton]]
Some [[Beastfolk]] may even bear forms that appear similar to one of these races. However they are still biologically different.

## Additional Info
- [[Beastfolk]] are often called [[Beastmen]] by ignorant, or racist individuals. This is a term of great offence to them. [[Beastmen]] were the monstrous evil that created the [[Beast Ire]] plague. [[Beastfolk]] are the descendants of the brave, and stalwart individuals who did not give into a lust for power. They are effectively the opposite of [[Beastmen]].
