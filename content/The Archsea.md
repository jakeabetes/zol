---![[The Archsea.jpg]]

The waters that bind the kingdoms of [[Zol]]. [[The Archsea]] is the central most body of water within [[The Three Corners]]. It is abundant with ships, sea life, and sea monsters. Many make lives for themselves on its coasts, some even do so beneath its waves in the enigmatic city of [[Abdjadan]].

Pirates, merchants, fishermen, and adventurers have made great use of the sea that has supported life in [[The Three Corners]] since [[The Awakening]].

## History and Inhabitants
[[The Archsea]] is the most widely civilized sea. It is the waters that connect the east and west. There are settlements all along its coasts, and it borders [[The Grand Nothing]]. Its surface is no stranger to warfare, trade, piracy, and adventure.

Many people live upon its coast and some even live deeper into its borders in [[Abdjadan]] and [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]].

## Borders
The Sea's edges reach:
- [[The Kulpis Desert]]
- [[Laenwalde]]
- [[Kapesh]]
- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]
- [[The Grand Nothing]]
	- It is a mystery as to how the draining of water into [[The Grand Nothing]] effects sea levels. Despite the massive volumes that pour over its edge, the seas never drain. Some believe it is because the ocean is infinite, others think it is the will of [[Ohlit]].
- [[The Narrow Sea]]
- [[The Vast Sea]]
