The [[Fell]] is known for being extremely dangerous in its wilds, but oddly welcoming in its sole city of [[Dislimn]]. Its thorn covered forests are filled with disturbing monsters, and it is constantly under the cover of night.

The [[Fell]] is infamous for its influence on the [[Prime Material Plane]] like the affliction of Lycanthropy and Vampirism.

## Citizens of the Fell
Within the Fell, there is a sole city known as [[Dislimn]]. The city itself has a frightening appearance, but they never turn anyone away.

The City is by no means safe, and newcomers are typically prayed upon. However it is quite easy to find work and the cost of living is quite low. On top of that it is know for having delicious foods served at low prices.

The *local* population is made up of beings who fled the [[Prime Material Plane]] to escape their old lives, or beings who were born there.

The higher classes of society are typically high vampires, powerful lycanthropes, or Shades which are descendants of beings whos family has lived in the [[Fell]] for many generations. These beings are very rare and appear almost as dark tears in reality in the shape of their lineages race.

There is also a rare population of [[Fairies]] that reside in the [[Fell]].

## Travel to the Fell
Since the [[Fell]] is an echo of the [[Prime Material Plane]], travel between these planes is much simpler than most other cases. There are even many natural portals to the [[Fell]] that emerge and disappear naturally all over the [[Prime Material Plane]].

If one travels between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the [[Fell]] they would expect to end up in the same spot geographically, but on the other side.

## Home of The Hooded Presence
One of the [[Wayward Gods]] resides in the [[Fell]]. [[The Hooded Presence]] is a known force of this realm, but it spends most of its time in far away corners, and pays [[Dislimn]] no mind.
