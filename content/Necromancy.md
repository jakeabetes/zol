# Necromancy
[[Necromancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves meddling with a living or dead creatures life-force. It is considered to be the most controversial school as it possesses the power of healing wounds and disease, but can also extend ones life far beyond that of a normal mortal, or even bring the dead back to life.

This spawns massive ethical, and theological debate. The general population is made very uncomfortable by any usage of this magic that is not used for healing. All non healing magic is considered a crime in [[Laenwalde]], [[The Glassius Reach]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Ward]].

## Effects of Necromancy on a User
Any long term usage of this magic outside the realm of general healing seems to have a dark effect on ones mind and body. Physicality tends towards something monstrous in nature, and the individual's mind begins to lose the concept of empathy. It is not known why this happens. This does not seem to occur to those who revivify the dead with good intent while using the will of [[Observance]].

Any individual brought fully back to life via [[Necromancy]] permanently receives the mortality rune from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] somewhere on their body. This is commonly referred to as a [[Death Scar]] Successive revivals chain together It is not known as to why this happens, but there is a lot of superstition around these individuals. This contributed to the discovery of [[Iron Light]].

## Necromancy and The Mortal Coil
[[The Mortal Coil]] is a strange force that drives all life and death in [[Zol]]. A common misconception is that [[Necromancy]] is the direct interference with [[The Mortal Coil]]. This is not the case.

Necromancers utilize the laws known about [[The Mortal Coil]] and the tools [[Necromancy]] provides to cheat death by artificially conducting the actions [[The Mortal Coil]] takes naturally.
