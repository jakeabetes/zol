# The Castle of Bodies
*Void God of Wrath and Madness, Major Deity*
![[The Castle of Bodies.png]]

The product of desperation, a horrible result of an attempt to combat [[Goh'zul]] gone wrong. [[The Castle of Bodies]] is a sentient structure that was created by one of the worlds [[Goh'zul]] was set to devour. The people of this world attempted to create a device that would allow them to kill [[Goh'zul]].

The device catastrophically failed and consumed the castle it was housed in and everyone inside. This resulted in a fusion between the device, the people and the structure itself. Forming a being of horrible power, and hundreds of minds who have all gone mad after eons of pain.

[[The Castle of Bodies]] still true to its original mission seeks the destruction of [[Goh'zul]]. This unfortunate set of instructions means it targets the innocent world of [[Zol]].

## Depiction
A dark castle like structure that is decaying to rubble at its edges. It's overall shape remains constant but under close inspection, beings can be seen moving through its walls.

## Symbolism
An upside-down tower.

## Behavior
[[The Castle of Bodies]] does not seem to cooperate with any being or even the other [[Void Gods]]. It seems to rest for long periods of time then randomly attack [[Zol]].

Some individuals claim to hear its voices calling out to them, bidding them to carry out their destructive wills.

[[The Castle of Bodies]] is regarded as a monstrosity of thousands of mortal minds and unknown power melded together. This tortured being is mad in every sense of the word.

## Realm
[[The Castle of Bodies]] resides in [[The Void]].

## Worshipers
Some dark worship is directed to [[The Castle of Bodies]], but to little avail. It only seems to randomly select mortals. Giving them power and/or driving them mad.

Some questionable research is performed by academics who seek the knowledge contained within its many minds, possibly even traversing its horrific structure.
