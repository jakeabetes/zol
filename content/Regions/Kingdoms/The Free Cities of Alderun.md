![[The Free Cities of Alderun.jpg]]

Once a land of oppressed [[Off-Human]] people in South Kapesh, Alderun now flourishes with life and culture. A land where anyone can choose to be who they want, but this is not to say Alderun is without its issues.

During the [[First Age]], [[Human Sovereigntists]] claimed that the Off-Humans must follow a strict set or laws, or face slavery. Kapesh intended to discover a way to restore the [[Great Magic]] of the humans by recombining the Off-Humans with their once hosts. The humans were understandably met with resistance.

Rebellions rose and fell. The overturning of South Kapesh was not until [[Eirmond the Brave]] rose to glory. Eirmond was a stellar fighter, and a great leader to the Off-Human People.  A [[Half-Orc]] man, born in [[Ka'thoor]]. He won Alderun, city-by-city, in what is now known as the [[Alderian Rebellion]].

Alderun is now lead by the [[Alderian Council]], a democratically elected board of individuals with a representative from each city.
