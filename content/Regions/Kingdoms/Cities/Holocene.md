Holocene, the Pale City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and named for the stark white [[Chalkstone]] it is built from, and known for its wine, art, music and medicine. Holocene is the richest city east of [[Mod Dranor]]. This was made possible due to the value of refined chalkstone in the practice of [[Alchemy]], and [[Iron Light]].

Holocene's resources are controlled by the [[Alderian Seat]] of the city, and the profits are shared amongst all its citizen within the walls. This makes for a wonderfully high quality of life, but gaining citizenship in Holocene is no simple feat.

The generosity stops at the city's breach. Holocene's [[Gate Town]], [[Ides]], is full of people who wanted to make a home within the city, but did not qualify. The produced culture is a tight-knit ghetto. The rivalry between Ides and the Inner city is a staple of Holocene.

Holocene's east overlooks [[The Grand Nothing]], and houses the [[Pale Lift]].
