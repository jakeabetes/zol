title: "Damnation"
---
*The culmination of thousands of hells. All created to seek the destruction of [[Goh'zul]], now formed as one unified force of destruction. Still seeking to fulfil their original quest, their Ire now threatens [[The Prime]] as it is formed from what remains of their original nemesis. One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence.* 

The land of the dead, and the punishment of [[Zol]]. [[Damnation]] is a subplane to [[The Void]] and home to [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] along with his legion of [[Fiends]].

[[Damnation]] is divided into an unknown amount of layers. The known structure of [[Damnation]] is largely gained from reports given by the rare resurrected dead who were able to recall pieces of their time there, and Academics who have utilized magic to divine information about the horrifying place.

Damnation is home to [[Fiends]], and the souls of the dead. These beings exist in all over Damnation in many different environments, all ruled by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]].

## Apolyatum, The City of The Dead
The resting place for souls not fit for punishment. It is the highest layer of [[Damnation]]. Manifesting as a vast city in a colossal cavern. An ever present grey fog looms overheard. The fog sheds a faint yellow light when it nears the ground providing the only natural illumination in Apolyatum.

Mortal souls placed here are all given a very similar, grey toned, physically healthy body that echoes their appearance from the middle point of their lives.

All are given a chance at making a comfortable, eternal life in Apolyatum. Everyone arrives in the city with 3 stone coins and simple clothing.

Here they can live lives similar to that of the mortal world. Making friends, eating food, and experiencing niceties. They also face class discrimination, brutality, and other inconveniences similar to life.

Many odd jobs unique to Apolyatum are available to the souls here, but mostly consist of excavating the cave walls, constructing new homes, and agriculture.

A group of [[Fiends]] known as *The Regal* act as the nobility and policing force of Apolyatum. Many souls spend their days serving them, but some successful souls rise to noble ranks as well.

## The Tomb of Stone
The maze of pain. A seemingly endless labyrinth of punishment and monsters. Souls guilty of crimes not quite worthy of eternal punishment are sent here.

Indestructible monoliths are scattered all over the maze. Glowing with faint green marks that house the souls of those who trapped within the labyrinth.

Beings sent to the labyrinth are forced to play in a horrible, endless game. They wake up in bodies at the base of the strange monoliths, with the knowledge that there are exits at the far reaches of the labyrinth that lead away from the Tomb.

To reach them, the must make their way through the dangerous maze filled with torturous traps, mechanical monsters, and fiendish abominations. When the damned are inevitably killed within the Tomb of Stone, they wake up in a new body at the base of a monolith, rather than facing the effects of [[The Mortal Coil]]. It is not known how this works, but it is assumed that the bodies used by the punished are not their true form which is instead held within the monoliths.

This creates a society of beings who live in constant fear. Always running, hiding, fighting, and dying. Factions of these people rise and fall, and even social or political hierarchies form.

Souls are made to reside here for a unknown amount of years based on their punishment. They are only allowed to leave once their sentence is complete, or they make it to one of the impossibly far doors leading to other layers of [[Damnation]].

## Zaereza
Only two things are known about Zaereza. It is a vast and expansive collection Damnation's layers, one of which contains the palace of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is also the grounds upon which souls are punished for an eternity.

It is likely full of many distinct layers all with their own properties. However, the details of this remain unknown to the mortal world.

## Obliteration
Where souls, too dangerous and horrible, are sent for destruction.

![[Obliteration.png]]

The lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. Obliteration is an infrequently used tool, possessed by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. A place so grim and terrifying, its existence was once thought to be an impossibility.

Obliteration is completely devoid of color, and contains unnamed titans that wield colossal tools used to destroy souls.

It is not known why [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] destroys dangerous souls. Academics theorize it is to harvest power, or maintain order within hell.
