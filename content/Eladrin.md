## Description
[[Eladrin]] appear very similarly to [[High Elves]], but bear slightly differing physiology. [[Eladrin]] are the product of [[Elves]] who ventured into the [[Fey]] not long after [[The Awakening]]. Their long spent time in the strange realm has altered their minds and bodies in strange ways. [[Eladrin]] don't often make their way back into [[The Prime]], but those who do often mask as [[High Elves]]. However their personality is very jovial, adventurous, and silly in comparison to many [[Elves]]. They often speak as if they understand reality better than those who are not of the [[Fey]]. They are also naturally gifted with [[Magic]], but academics do not know precisely why.
