title: "The University"
---
Those who seek to understand [[The Wills]], the people of [[The Three Corners]], and how the world can be bettered. [[The University]] was founded upon altruistic motives during the later stages of [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. It is comprised of three branches:
- The [[Arcanum]], which studies the will of [[Arcana]]
	- [[The Brass Hall]]
	- [[Jhenbridge]]
- The [[Observum]], which studies the will of [[Observance]]
	- [[The Obsidian Temple]]
	- [[The First Bastion]]
- The [[Viridium]], which studies the will of [[Viridescence]]
	- [[The Conservatory]]

## Values
*"The pursuit of understanding, and the betterment of [[Zol]]"*

[[The University]] as a whole was a product of a need for understanding the nature of [[The Wills]]. At its heart, the organization seeks to educate and draw conclusions about the mysteries of [[Zol]]. This manifests as teaching, exploration, historical investigation, archeology, experimentation, and things of the like. [[The University]] is not known for tampering with great dark forces like some other institutions. However it is not entirely without its own wrong doings.

[[The University]] is arguably the largest singular institution in all [[The Three Corners]]. Both in its members, and geographic distribution. This means its resources, and authority are equally distributed. This is not to say it is spread thin, however it is difficult to manage such a large entity. Occasionally, things that are macabre, extortionate, dangerous, or just plainly unwise are conducted under the banner of [[The University]].

## Origin
In the [[First Age]], during [[The Taming of the Badlands]], a group of powerful academics in [[Ryze]] began conceptualizing an organization that would seek to make sense of [[The Trinity]]. It would be similar to the academic institutions of the east, but different in the fact that it would not neglect the more spiritual aspects of [[The Wills]].

During the unification efforts of [[The Badlands]], these academics were instrumental in bringing order to the land. Originally the school began in [[The Brass Hall]], a large section of [[Brass Taldora]]. Each of the three wings within the hall was dedicated to one of [[The Wills]]. Forming The [[Arcanum]], [[Observum]], and [[Viridium]]. It wasn't long before [[The University]] outgrew the hall, and began acquiring, and constructing buildings elsewhere. At first this was just within [[Ryze]], but it soon expanded to other cities as [[The University]] began absorbing smaller organizations like [[Jhenbridge]], [[The Obsidian Temple]] and [[The First Bastion]].

## Structure
[[The University]] follows a simple method of organization, as it is complexly comprised of many different subgroups all across [[Laenwalde]].
- ### Leadership
	- At the top of the hierarchy sits one master for each of [[The Wills]]. They must be in the uppermost circles of the organization, and are almost always the leader of one of [[The University]]'s schools. It is worth noting that those in this position have historically served on [[The Golden Council]] of [[Heliodor]].
		- [[Arcanum]] - Grandmaster Whiles Gennador, an aged human man, and head of [[The Brass Hall]]. Brother to High Priest Tarsin Gennador
		- [[Observum]] - High Priest Tarsin Gennador, the head of the Zolaen Church within [[Laenwalde]]. An aged human man. Brother to Grandmaster Whiles Gennador
		- [[Viridium]] - High Se'kir Fjor Mizella, a tabaxi woman of great wisdom. Head of [[The Conservatory]].
	- Within each of the schools, the organizational structure differs.
- ### Size
	- [[The University]] is massive. It is over eight thousand members strong across all its subsidiaries.
- ### Rules
	- There are many rules all throughout [[The University]], however they all circle back to one ideal: Knowledge should not be used to do harm.
- ### Admission
	- Admission to [[The University]] varies based on the school which one enters.
- ### Symbolism
	- The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for mind
