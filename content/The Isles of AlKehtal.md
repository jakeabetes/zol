---*The Island City of Pirates*
![[Isles of Al Kehtal.png]]

Built from the remains of ships torn asunder by waves or combat, [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] is a haven for the pirates of [[The Three Corners]]. It is a city where all ships and crews must set aside rivalries, lay down their arms to do trade, resupply, and have a drink. There is no King, or Queen of [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]]. However there is a ruling body known as The Furled Sail Council, made up of the most influential captains amongst the community, lead by the Lord Captain. This group operates under a very flexible, but important ruleset. No one has a record of when it started, or who wrote the original rules but [[The Code]] binds all pirates.

The city is broken up into three main islands:

## Port Keep
![[port_keep.png]]

The North East Island. Port Keep is the central hub for the island, and the meeting place for The Furled Sail Council. It is the smallest island of the city, and few have any real reason to go here.

## Flotsam
![[flotsam.png]]

The South East Island. The largest of the islands. Flotsam is a place of trade, and has the most permanent homes. Its island also has a great deal of natural jungle on it, providing resources for the city.

## Jetsam
![[jetsam.png]]

The West Island. The busiest part of the city. Jetsam is the place all pirates think of when looking for a place to plan, plot, repair, rest, fight, fuck, dine, and drink. It is an ugly, dirty, and crowded place. It is impossible for a pirate not to love. Many of its districts are heavily associated with some groups of pirates, and it is important to know where you are going. Lest you find yourself in an place where you are not welcome.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |

| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Furled Sail Council | Rank         | The captains of the most influential crews. One can only be brought into the council by invitation from more than half of the council, or by inheriting the spot from a superior that noted you as their successor. Overseeing this group is the Lord Captain. A title given by popular vote amongst council members. This rank gives an individual 2 votes, and ties go in favor of the Lord Captain. This seems like a small thing, but votes frequently reach an even split. This makes having the Lord Captains favor an extremely important thing. The trickle down effect from this paves the way for the whole power struggle amongst pirates. |
| Gilded              | Rank         | Those recognized as important enough by the council to receive a gilded crest. These crests come with a whole cast of benefits such as better deals for repairs on ships, supplies, and taxes on trades. They also mark you and an influential person amongst pirates. This status means actions you take may have more sever consequences by [[The Code]]. Rivalries you make, battles you partake in, and treasure you hunt will likely have an effect on the greater community of pirates. If you do things that could damage the way of life for pirates, there are severe consequences.                                                                           |
| Goons               | Rank         | The average pirate. Low ranking captains, or general crew members will have this rank by default. This group makes up more than 90% of pirates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Locals              | Social Class | Those who reside in the city year round, and are not pirates by trade. These people have lives similar to that of other common folk across [[The Three Corners]], however they have to deal with the ongoings of pirates on a daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Binds               | Profession   | Those who work in the markets as tax collectors. Binds help facilitate trade amongst pirates and merchants, and take a percentage for the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Rule                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Rule of Stashed Swords | Within [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]], no one is allowed to bring their weapons around with them in a way where they can be readily available for combat. Fighting is allowed, but if you aim to kill you will be seen as a traitor. This goes for [[Caster]]s as well, you can use magic in a fight, but if you seek to do permanent damage or kill [[The Code]] will not see you favorably. |
| The Rule of Locked Chests  | Within [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]], no one can steal from each other. Things can be bought, traded, or wagered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| The Rule of Kept Council   | The pirates of [[The Three Corners]] will respect the rule of The Furled Sail Council. The Council will appoint a Lord Captain who will hold greater voting power. Council members must be invited by more than half of current council members, or inherit the role from their superior.                                                                                                     |

| The Rule of Gilded Crest   | Pirates of great influence will be given a gilded crest. This crest symbolizes their influence, and gives them more favorable taxes, but more stringent rules when it comes to [[The Code]]. One cannot deny a crest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
