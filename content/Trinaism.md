## Overview
[[Trinaism]] is a Trinity-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that all things, even the [[Gods]], are only allowed to exist through [[The Trinity]]. It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god.

[[Trinaism]] teaches the idea that all things are one. All things come from [[The Trinity]], and ultimately all things return to [[The Trinity]]. Even alien things from [[The Cosmos]] must adhere to the [[Magic]] and divine aspects of [[The Trinity]]. The latter fact is supported by science.

[[Trinaism]] also teaches the idea that there is a careful, intended balance to all things which [[The Trinity]] has orchestrated. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] granted the people of [[Zol]] free will. Through this gift, it is possible to create imbalance in the world, and only through the teachings of [[The Trinity]] can people maintain its careful balance.

[[Trinaism]] sees the [[Zolaen Gods]] as extensions of [[The Trinity]].

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
In regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Trinaism]] believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Trinian scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. In defeating [[The Wretch]], [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]] allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].

### Ancient Society
Trinian scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].

### The Undoing
Trinian scripture talks about the ancient people of [[Old Zol]] straying from [[The Trinity]]'s careful balance. It is said that they did this in an attempt to reach divinity themselves. In doing this, they created such an imbalance in the world that [[The Undoing]] occurred. It is thought that this imbalance was created by ancient [[Humans]].

It is believed in [[Trinaism]] that [[The Trinity]] began weaving threads of Fate to ensure the people of [[Zol]] would never stray into the dark again.

## Church Structure
The Trinian Church is known for its adherence to hierarchical structure. These hierarchies form based on communities an their connectedness to greater societal groups. This is most often seen within the scope cities. Cities will usually have a grand cathedral dedicated to Trinian Worship. This cathedral would be lead by an **Obseratum**, the highest form of priesthood within [[Trinaism]]. Beneath that would be **Grand Priests**, **Arch Priests**, **High Priests**, and finally **Priests**.

## Followers
### Modernist
Modernist [[Trinaism]] typically focuses on the concept of order, and interconnectedness between things. It idealizes the concept of being exemplary within ones life. It does not teach the ideals of going on to greater things. To put another way, if you are a farmer it is holy to be a *great* farmer. This is because great farmers are needed to maintain the interconnected aspects of society, people, and the world itself.

### Fundamentalist
Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for its idealization of hierarchy, order, balance, and structure. This manifests largely as the ideal that everything is as it should be. It believes that [[The Trinity]] has placed everything in its place, and one should respect that place. Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for supporting one-sided societal structures like high nobility and [[Slavery]].

## Geographically Significant Regions
[[Trinaism]] is extremely wide-spread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]].

## Other Information
- [[Trinaism]]'s specific teachings about structure, order, and interconnectedness largely depend on the interpretation of the clergy within one's church. Trinian scripture as a whole is comprised of many texts. This has made for many unique interpretations of the religion's details as not all priesthoods value each piece of writing equally. 
- [[Trinaism]] is closely related to the [[Ashian]] church. They have many similarities. However the nuances of [[Ashian]] religion are what make them distinct.
- Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] supports the ideas of [[Great Magic]] and [[The Triumvirate]].
- [[Trinaism]] is similar in many ways to Zolaen-Centric belief. However, it holds [[The Trinity]] above the [[Zolaen Gods]].
- Some manifestations of [[Trinaism]] contend with the idea of [[The Anti-Trinity]], a dark counterpart to their god.
