# Amplidation
[[Amplidation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is an uncommon school. It is magic that involves the manipulation of Gravitational [[energy]].

[[Amplidation]] is quite difficult as it requires the user to not only create gravitational bonds, but lessen or completely sever their targets connection to the gravity of [[Zol]]. The latter takes an extremely high degree of accuracy and training to perfect.

There are 3 different types of gravitational bindings using [[Sympathetic bonds]]. These are:
- Objective Ties
	- Causing a target to have gravity towards another
- Directional Ties
	- Causing a target to have gravity in a set direction
- Wells
	- Causing a target to pull or repel everything in its vicinity
In all of these cases, a [[Caster]] can control the amount of gravity that is influencing their target based on their skill.

gravitational bindings are temporary, usually lasting minutes unless maintained by a [[Caster]] or some mechanism.
