# Abjuration
[[Abjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves the counteraction of energy. This allows casters to defend themselves from physical attack, and interfere with another use of magic.

It can create physical barriers, or mask a targets connection to [[The Trinity]] entirely. This magic is essential to any caster who would brave the perils of [[Zol]].

Academically it is known to be the driest subject, but those who study it are know to excel in their endeavors.
