# Conjuration
[[Conjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves folding space for the purposes of teleportation, or bringing creatures and objects to, or away from a [[Caster]]. These usages of magic can span entire [[Planes]] or even cross into other [[Planes]] given the skill of the user.

It requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.

Users of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying.
