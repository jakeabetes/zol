# The Triumvirate
The assumed progenitor races of Zol: [[Dwarves]], [[Elves]], and [[Humans]]. Many theories exist about the origins of these races and their place in the world. Some of which include: the will of [[Zolaen Gods]], a product of [[The Undoing]], or the most popular theory being some manifestation [[The Trinity]]'s power. 

The latter theory is largely based on artifacts uncovered from [[The Grand Nothing]]. These discoveries only include mentions of Dwarves, Elves, and Humans. Each of which seemed to have possessed a lifespan centuries long, and a special connection to one of The Trinity's forces. The Dwarves with [[Observance]], the Elves with [[Viridescence]], and Humans with [[Arcana]]. These races also make up the largest percentage of the Zolaen population.

Much is inferred based on these 2 main facts. The information is also paired with many other smaller discoveries like biological traits, and what little history is available from the time after The Undoing. Because of this, it is assumed that The Undoing was caused by Humans. 

As punishment their longevity was taken from them. This lost power was fragmented into the [[Off-Human]] races. This theory charges many polarized beliefs in many cultures, and is to blame for many dark parts of history. Including slavery, unethical arcane practices, and wars like the [[Triumvirate Battles]] or the [[Alderian Rebellion]].

There are many facts that contest this belief as well which include: longevity in Off-Human races, and there being no modern racial difference in the proficiency of harnessing The Trinity's powers.
