# Illusion
[[Illusion]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves the manipulation of light, kinetic and cognitive [[energy]]. These manipulations allow a [[caster]] to create manifestations that illuminate spaces, relay information, and fool individuals.

Some users of illusion are so skilled they can fool the minds of a target into believing an illusion is actually harming them, possibly causing real death. Others are so skilled to a point where manifestations created from light become temporarily real.
