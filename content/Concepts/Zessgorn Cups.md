# Zessgorn Cups
Zessgorn Cups are a social tool utilized in the city of [[Zessgorn]] to determine someone's status and patronage in the cities complex socioeconomic structure. Said structure is largely determined by the [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These rings give both magical power and social status.

The rings originally had a set hierarchy the citizens followed. This was until [[Rali Trunsarr]], [[The Paige of Cups]] discovered a secret potential within her ring. The [[The Paige of Cups, Ring of Tarot]] gives the user the ability to attune to magical objects with greater affinity. It was understood that the bearer of this ring could more efficiently draw power from magical object.

This was only until Rali had discovered she could attune to any number of the lesser Rings of Tarot. Going rouge, she scrounged, blackmailed, bought, and killed until she was in possession of all the known lesser rings of Tarot.

This arsenal of power made The Paige of Cups the most powerful of all the [[Tarot Ring Bearers]]. She formed a criminal network that took over Zessgorn, and changed it forever. Now even the bearer of [[The Empress, Ring of Tarot]] and [[The Emperor, Ring of Tarot]] pay respect to [[The Paige of Cups]].

Now all who enter Zessgorn must fit into the hierarchy of the city. Each person must carry a cup with them, with the symbol of the Ring Bearer they pay tribute to for protection and services.

Each cup is unique, and given by a ring bearer themselves. If a ring bearer would die, their patrons would go to their successor.
