- **Chapter begins on the early morning of the 12th of Spring, 4466**
- Arrival at Tenzentak
- Quite the big deal train was attacked. Word was sent ahead to the city and your train was met with a swarming crowd at the station.
- Laizen gave you some advice and did his best to maneuver our heroes into a favorable position.
	- Being so close to the crime made them suspect, and things would be easier for them the closer they were associated with the guild.
	- Laizen provided a distraction and allowed for our heroes to slip into the city
- Tenzentak is a marvel of a place. It is tall and magnificent city overflowing with activity like:
	- The chaotic bustle of trade
	- Crowds of incoming people. Importing things in prep for victory day
	- Long, elegant and high Bridges that spanned over the hidden Low City
		- A place divided from Tenzentak Proper by the Rift Smog Filters
	- Ridiculous actors in the streets, putting on silly and promiscuous show involve magic and bare skin
		- A clear mark of your presence in The Free Cities
- Arrival at The Bladehammer Guild. A place sprawling with intrigue and adventure.
- At the public desk, you cut in line thanks to Cyrus' mischievous magic
- You presented your tickets to the rude and pretentious individuals at the front desk. Guild Members of the Kerketh Academy Sub-faction
	- Bennet Frence - A low ranking Guild Member and snooty noble elf
	- Master Bellard - A mean looking, busy-body old human. A master arcanist and guild mind.
- Master Bellard seemed keen on precuring help for some duty, when Bennet asked if our heroes would be suitable. The notion was meet with a scoff and a disgusted sneer at Sherman.
- Our heroes were instead made to be "Legs". A notion which seemed funny concept to Bennet.
- Apparently being legs meant serving Abacus Oleander, a Double Amputee Dragonborn Guild Mind. Once a professor at Kerketh. 
- Old Abby proved to be a very friendly individual with a seemingly bad reputation, despite his kindness
	- He utilizes a wheelchair, an arachic contraption for a skilled arcanist.
- Some people call him "Professor", but he did not present himself that way. In fact he seems to try and deter people from using the title.
- In searching for work for you, he seemed unimpressed with the tasks he had at hand. Then, in a moment of inspiration he asked our heroes if they could keep a secret.
- Given quest to venture into the grand nothing to retrieve lost Kerketh Equipment following a distress beacon.
	- A piece of salvage that he should not technically be in possession of.
	- Though he seemed certain it may contain information about flora and fauna out in The Grand Nothing that could aid the famines which plagued the land.
	- In Kerketh hands, that information may be used to turn a profit. In his hands, that information could be freely distributed.
- The beacon was emitted by a Warforged. He drew a sketch of it for you, and it matched exactly to the one seen in the dream shared by our heroes.
- Before setting of to purchase supplies, you were warned of a sandstorm.
- Shopping at rift top square
	- Deimos' Premonition of something happening in the square in the coming week.
- Chocolate, Coffee, and Rats for brunch.
- A posted bounty for Aleksander Salt, a Orcish man of grey skin and a single tusk was found by Cyrus.
- During your morning, our heroes began to notice the outer-most edges of secrets amongst their group
	- Cyrus carried a pleasant scent that no one could agree upon
	- Deimos knows somethingâ€¦ and doesn't seem keen on explaining himself
	- The Nobleman Grung you are with is broke, and is slowly turning into smoke
	- Magnus is not leading the life he should be as a Stormblessed
	- And Sherman's Brain holds flashes of frightening traumatic memories, and he claims that he can dream despite being a Warforged.
- Set off on your Journey
- Met Chapter Frond, the Upper Lift Attendant
	- Warned of a sandstorm, again
	- Granted equipment tokens for:
		- a Drift Spiker
		- and a Flatpan Skimmer
- Saw Gilligan's lift and The Grand Nothing
	- During their descent, a massive bird attacked the lift. Veterans of the guild didn't even flinch as the Rok (a species of predatory bird in The Grand Nothing) was zapped by the Lift's defenses.
- Met Guild Mind Melshin Mord, overseer of the Lower Lift.
	- Warned of a sandstorm, once again.
- Met Spinner, head Artificer of the Skimmer Yard
	- He taught you how to operate the dangerous vehicle, and sent you on your way!
