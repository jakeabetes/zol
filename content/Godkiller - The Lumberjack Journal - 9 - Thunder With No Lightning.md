title: "Godkiller - The Lumberjack Journal - 9 - Thunder With No Lightning"
---
I try to force myself to write in The New Tongue sometimes. Its one of the few ways I can think to normalize it. It's strange, like lightning with no thunder. What was meant to be a power to match the gods is now just… mundane. Well, perhaps mundane is not the right word for it. It remains unchanged over thousands of years. A surprisingly useful trait as far as history and society is concerned. I wonder about the effect it had on The Watcher, to imprison nearly the entirety of one of the Tongues. Binding The New Tongue was The Watcher's only option, but it just incentives his death even more.

I think it is better left locked away. The people of the modern world wouldn’t know what to do if they suddenly had access to the entirety of something as dangerous as The First or Old Tongue. Modern people lack the education, will, society and the kindness to support it. It would be pandemonium.
