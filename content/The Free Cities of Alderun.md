Once a land of oppressed [[Off-Human]] people in South Kapesh, Alderun now flourishes with life and culture. A land where anyone can choose to be who they want, but this is not to say Alderun is without its issues.

During the [[First Age]], [[Human Sovereigntists]] claimed that the Off-Humans must follow a strict set or laws, or face slavery. Kapesh intended to discover a way to restore the [[Great Magic]] of the humans by recombining the Off-Humans with their once hosts. The humans were understandably met with resistance.

Rebellions rose and fell. The true overturning of South Kapesh was not until [[Eirmond the Brave]] rose to glory. Eirmond was a stellar fighter, and a great leader to the Off-Human People.  A [[Half-Orc]] man, born in [[Ka'thoor]]. He won Alderun, city-by-city, a civil war that is now known as the [[Alderian Rebellion]].

Alderun is now lead by the [[Alderian Council]], a democratically elected board of individuals with a representative from each city.

Alderun also borders [[The Grand Nothing]], it has two [[Great Lifts]]. One in [[Tenzentak]], and the other in [[Holocene]].

## The Alderian Wilds
Diverse like no other region, The Alderian wilds contain a menagerie of animals, plants, and monsters that differ wildly as one travels from [[Zessgorn]] to [[Holocene]].

The regions diversity gives much opportunity to its people, but its monsters cause for many problems. The Cities of Alderun spend much of their resources focusing on inner workings of their urban centers. This leaves the wilds an untamed and lawless place.

Criminals and monsters roam the remote places of Alderun. While not as dangerous as its western neighbor, [[Kapesh]]. One would not want to be caught off the safe path in these wilds.

Geographical features vary from gorgeous coast lines, rolling hills, spanning rivers, large lakes, and the ever strange cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]].
