![[King Tatelak II.png]]

Born under the name Byrell Callzen, [[King Tatelak II]] was discovered as a forgotten heir living amongst commoners in [[Woogis]] by academics from [[The University]] who were aiding in the reinstatement of a monarch in [[Laenwalde]]. Many think him a figure head for the [[The Golden Council]], some think him a poor, underqualified ruler. Those close to him see him as a good man who is doing the best he can in an extremely difficult position.
