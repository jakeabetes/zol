*Fear the Blood of Beasts*

A well intentioned gift from a god turned into a living nightmare.

During the [[First Age]], the king of beasts, [[Kerndall]] sought to give the people of [[Zol]] the strength and instincts of beasts. He spilled his own blood into the lakes and rivers of [[Zol]]. Those who drank of the waters were granted whispers of power, and strange dreams.

Some did not notice, or even undergo the affects. Those who did were given the option to follow the instincts of beasts. The afflicted initially felt a pulling sensation to the wilderness. Those who gave in abandoned their old lives to seek the source of this yearning.

They lived like primal peoples: hunting, scavenging, and howling under moonlight. The more they gave in, the more they grew in their strength. Bestial blood began to fill their veins. It increased their physical abilities, senses, and furthered the odd dreams.

[[Kerndall]] meant for these people to be a legion of strong beings. They could defend themselves with no need for society and laws. Directly experiencing the wonder of nature day in and day out.

For a time it was a sort of paradise for these people. The towns and cities they abandoned were left in shock and fear of their loved one vanishing to the wilderness, but it was not a lethal event so it did not spark widespread panic. Thought it was not long for the nature of mortals to reemerge in these bestial peoples.

Some of the changed individuals sought more, they hunted larger and larger prey. Consuming them and gaining much more of [[Kerndall]]'s essence through biomagnification. Their greed began to drive the transformation down a dark route. Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city outskirts.

Eventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name [[Bloodhunters]], and the hunted were called [[Beastmen]]. Their affliction was dubbed as [[Beast Ire]].

The beasts were extremely powerful and mad, they took warriors of equal strength to kill them. Many warriors began consuming the blood of the slain [[Beastmen]] in small doses to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of [[Beast Ire]].

[[Kerndall]] sought to stop the affliction but it had taken on a life of its own, tainted by greed and the conflict between mortals and [[Beastmen]]. [[Beast Ire]] became contagious by either bite or being bit by [[Beastmen]] in a nightmare caused by their proximity. As the crisis progressed the people of [[Zol]] went into hiding, and the ailment spread into the cities.

## Societal Impact
- The people of [[Zol]] had to hide in their homes save for hours around midday
- Proximity to the afflicted caused nightmares which haunted the population, and sometimes turned them.
- Many brave individuals had to become [[Bloodhunters]] to defend the cities and cull the numbers of [[Beastmen]]
- Some cities fell completely and were left to ruin. Others only fell for a time like [[Little Triumph]], [[Zessgorn]] or [[Reach Run]]

## Resolution
One day the contagious nature of the disease stopped entirely. [[Bloodhunters]] were able to kill off the final members of the [[Beastmen]]. It was later revealed to [[Zol]] that [[Kerndall]] had struck a deal with [[The Wasp Eater]]. The affliction would be transferred into [[Kerndall]]'s body, and the spread would cease. [[Kerndall]] would then become the servant of [[The Wasp Eater]].

[[Kerndall]] was maddened by the affliction and was dubbed [[Kerndall, the Feral King]]. His son [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] took his throne. Slowly, [[Zol]] began to return to normalcy.

Some of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed. They hid in remote locations. After the resolution of [[Beast Ire]], they were granted new forms by [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]]. A cast of peoples now known as [[Beastfolk]].
