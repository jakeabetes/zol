Known for its old ways, magic, and grit. Kapesh is ruled by [[King Galliard]] from its capital, [[Kierketholl]]. Bordering [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]], Kapesh finds itself the most central kingdom in The Three Corners of Civilization.

Kapesh is the oldest kingdom in Zol, as it was founded shortly after [[The Undoing]]. The [[Humans]] were scorned by the elves, dwarves, and gods. This made lives for the people of [[Kapesh]] more difficult at first, but quickly gave humans a reason to unify at a much faster rate than any other faction in all of [[Zol]]. [[Humans]] are known for their stubbornness in the face of resistance.

Kapesh's borders once included what is now the [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. When Kapesh first rose to power, all [[Off-Human]] races within its borders were heavily oppressed and many were forced to live as slaves. This was changed by The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. A civil war in which Kapesh lost its southern region to what is now known as The Free Cities of Alderun.

There is lots of superstition that regards humans as cursed, this belief is furthered by the problems that Kapesh has faced over the course of its existence. A kingdom located in a considerably inhospitable region filled with monsters, as well as a frankly volatile population. It has faced unique and isolated plagues and famine at various times through out its history. 

They are also known for waging war in the past against [[Gethsemane]] multiple times. Known as The [[Triumvirate Battles]], the conflicts never amounted to much other than unnecessary deaths. The only territory that has ever changed hands in this exchange was Stalke Island and the city of [[Riverbridge]].

Kapesh is home to many practitioners of [[Arcana]], most notably at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. Little fact is written on what exactly occurs there. On its surface it is a scholarly place of magic. The rumor mill however, spins stories of arcanists who tamper with the dark unknown forces of Zol.

## The Kapesh Wilds 
The Wilds of [[Kapesh]] consist of strange expanses, and dangerous forests that spill over from [[The Witchlands]]. While unsafe, [[Kapesh]] contains natural beauties and wonders unlike that of any other region.

Deep valleys holding winding rivers, flora and fauna that thrive in its mist covered wilds, and open landscapes marred by magical warfare that left hauntingly elegant scars.

Those who live out in the wilds are either sturdy bandits, or natives to [[The Witchlands]] who care not for the borders of civilization.

Monsters and thieves make straying from the roads of [[Kapesh]] dangerous for all who cannot hold their own.

Kapesh contains the Mountain Ranges:
- [[Demodemacht]]
- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]
- [[Stormwall]]

Kapesh has coastlines on:
- [[The Narrow Sea]]
- [[The Archsea]]

Kapesh Borders the Regions:
- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]
- [[The Witchlands]]

## Slaves of Kapesh
Long ago, before [[The Triumvirate]] Concord, [[Off-Human]]s were forced to serve as slaves to the [[Humans]] of [[Kapesh]]. After the [[Alderian Rebellion]] and the end of the [[Triumvirate Battles]], the widespread enslavement and mistreatment was quelled.

In modern day, slavery is still legal within [[Kapesh]]. This treatment is only given to those who commit crimes against the crown. When judged for these crimes, their sentencing may involve some term of enslavement. Be it temporary or permanent. Slaves are given a brand on their neck that distinguishes the specific terms of their enslavement.

Many people of [[Kapesh]] disagree with slavery, but the crown has yet to make the practice illegal. Slaves are typically owned by the crown but some are still owned by individuals.
