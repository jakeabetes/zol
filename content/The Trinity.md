One and the same with [[Zol]]. A force of three parts, manifested from the residual power of [[Goh'zul]]. Its power exists as the natural world, unharness magic, and lent power. From an academic perspective, The Trinity is thought to be a pseudo conscious force and acts towards a state of balance at all times. If pushed to far in a given direction, The Trinity will retaliate and attempt to return things back to a state of neutrality. From a Religious perspective, The Trinity is said to be something more than a god, or natural force. When viewed in this way, it is said to be the fulcrum upon which all things turn. The very means by which the gods, magic, and nature act upon the world. Trinity-Centric [[Religion]] holds the idea that "all things move through the Trinity". This means every birth, death, creation, destruction, artwork, and war is a result of all things moving along The Trinity's path.

## The Trinity and Magic

The three parts of [[The Trinity]] are: [[Arcana]], [[Viridescence]], and [[Observance]]. Those who utilize the force of The Trinity can harness one or many of the three forces by many different means.

[[The Trinity]] is a force stronger than any of the gods, and is Zol itself in it's essence. A facet of it can be wielded directly by mortals who know a word from [[The First Tongue]]. It is thought to be the source of all [[Magic]].

## Origin
[[Zol]] was created in the binding of The Trinity by the power of [[The Watcher in The Door]] who spoke [[The First Tongue]]. It continues to be bound by any who know parts of [[The First Tongue]], or as wills by the binding of One's [[Vizir]] or knowledge of [[The Old Tongue]].
