title: "The Trinity"
---# The Trinity
One and the same with [[Zol]]. A force of three parts, manifested from the residual power of [[Goh'zul]]. Its power exists as the natural world, unharness magic, and lent power. The Trinity is pseudo conscious force and acts towards a state of balance at all times. If pushed to far in a given direction, The Trinity will retaliate and attempt to return things back to a state of neutrality.

The three parts are as follows: [[Arcana]], [[Viridescence]], and [[Observance]]. Those who utilize the force of The Trinity can harness one or many of the three forces by many different means.

[[The Trinity]] is a force stronger than any of the gods, and is Zol itself in it's essence. A facet of it can be wielded directly by mortals who know a word from [[The First Tongue]]. It is the source of almost all [[Magic]].

# Origin
[[Zol]] was created in the binding of The Trinity by the power of [[The Watcher in The Door]] who spoke [[The First Tongue]]. It continues to be bound by any who know parts of [[The First Tongue]], or as wills by the binding of One's [[Vizir]] or knowledge of [[The Old Tongue]].
