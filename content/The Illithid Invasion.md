# The Illithid Invasion
*The first ever recorded incursion of [[Zol]] from a force beyond [[The Great Wall of Roots]].*

In the middle of the [[First Age]], [[Illithids]] invaded [[Zol]] suddenly and with a great initial force.

[[Illithids]] were known to exist in [[Zol]] in small numbers before this event, but no one knew their origin. The purpose of the attack seemed to be a sort of raid. With their goal being to be to *harvest* the cosmic power held within [[The Trinity]].

Their strategy largely relied on the strength and surprise of their initial attack, continued by growing their forces with their parasitic nature. This strategy may have worked for them in the long run, if not for the fact that they chose to attack [[Kapesh]] initially.

Their goal involved stealing large conduits of [[Viridescence]], the primal power of [[Zol]]. It apparently has immense value amongst [[The Cosmos]].

The [[Illithids]] took [[Stigmata]] as their base of operations, and converted many [[Humans]] to [[Illithids]]. These new [[Illithids]] were originally subservient to the invaders, but their human stubbornness resurfaced in their personality over time.

Because of this, the [[Illithids]] faced a great deal of in-fighting and discordance amongst their ranks. The converted humans tried to seize power for themselves. This ultimately left the invaders open to attacks.

[[Wordbearers]] and a large scale force managed to nearly wipe them all out in a single week once the effort was coordinated. Many [[Illithids]] fled to [[The Cosmos]] or hid in dark corners of [[Zol]]. Those that did not flee were captured and interrogated.

## Aftermath
The captured Illithids were interrogated for information about the attack. It turned out that they were a small, unremarkable force from wastelands of a place they called [[The Space Outside Reality]].

Much of what is known about [[The Cosmos]], [[The Space Outside Reality]], [[Illithids]], [[Goh'zul]], and the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]] comes from these interrogations.
