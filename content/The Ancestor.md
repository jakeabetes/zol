*Wandering God, Moral of Origin*
![[The Ancestor.png]]

To understand one's place in the world one must first understand where they have come from, and why. [[The Ancestor]], also known as *Fang*, bears the moral of Origin. A thing that lies at ones core, like the shell of a seed beneath the roots of a great oak tree. There is power in the place one comes from, a power that can be harnessed.

## Depiction
Often depicted as a large and powerful warrior. His physiology differs amongst depictions, but he is typically described as a bear humanoid, or a large human-like individual being wearing bear pelts.

## Moral
Origin is a broad concept. It entails the things that caused something to come into existence, and the lifespan of experiences that made them what they are now. All things have this story. Hidden within this story is power and purpose, and one can be taught to harness this power.

## Associations
[[The Ancestor]] is associated with:
- [[Beastfolk]]
- Warriors
- Nature
- Hunt

## Realm
Within [[The Unknown Realm]], [[The Ancestor]]'s domain is said to be a peaceful glade by those who have claimed to see it. A calm cabin in the forest that feels like a place one would retire to after a lifetime of adventures.

## Behavior
[[The Ancestor]] is said to speak to his followers like a wizened old tutor, or dueling trainer. His advice is simple, but contains much as if he selected every word with intention and ease. As if he had spotted a dozen missteps in your actions, but also sees your growth and efforts.

## Worshipers
Most who follow [[The Ancestor]] are solitary in their religion. They speak of their beginnings with him as unintentional, but the path of their life brought them to his wisdom. These individuals have pasts filled with hardships, and usually have great challenges ahead of them. They carry great burdens, but are know to fight for those who cannot.
