---*The City of Ruins, The Lost Capital Reborn*
![[Audran skyline 1.png]]

The largest city in all of [[Zol]]. [[Audran]] was once the prosperous capital of [[Laenwalde]]. Seen by all of [[Zol]] as a beacon of light and wonder. So large you could not walk from end to end in a day, not counting getting lost or stopping. Its wonderous empire stood proud for many generations, until one of the darkest days in [[Zol]]'s history: The Day of Madness.

The Day of Madness was a sudden event that involved [[The Castle of Bodies]] suddenly attacking [[Audran]]. Until that point, no one even knew [[The Castle of Bodies]] existed. Its presence drove the vast majority of the city's people into a blood frenzy. People blindly fought, killed and destroyed anything they could. The whole event only lasted a short while, but wholly ruined the city and its people.

The capital was abandoned, but slowly over time people returned and sought refuge in its ruins. Disorganized and ramshackle rebuilding began. Eventually, the combined efforts of many created a new and unique place where the great city once stood. It would never become the capital again, but is now home to a very unique, rich, and diverse culture.

One part ruined, one part rebuilt, one part ramshackle slum. The city is fast paced crowded, overpopulated, exciting, dangerous, and full of opportunity.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city was re-founded by individuals who chose to make a new life in the ruins of what once was. It is a city by the people, and for the people.

| Main Challenge | Governing the city is extremely difficult. Its ever-sprawling, overcrowded streets make a perfect environment for crime and chaos. Straying where one should not within [[Audran]] is very dangerous. |
| Climate | Temperate |
| Cuisine | Cultivated Fruits, Farmed Goods, Flatbread and rice based meals |
| Export | Investments, medicine, coffee, dyes, textiles, paper, books, and ink |
| Size | Massive |

## Major Features

| Feature | Description |
|-|-|
| Distinguishing Features | A massive lakeside city, textured with aged destruction that has been used as a foundation for new structure. |
| Architecture | A ramshackle, half-destroyed city. New buildings of differing materials and styles have been erected using the ruins of the ancient destruction as foundations. Some buildings have a strange half old stone, half new lumber look. Others are entirely new, and many remain with entire sections missing. To accommodate the large population, tents and other makeshift structures can be found everywhere one can logically (and sometimes illogically) be placed. |

| Symbolism | A tower with a window in the shape of an arched door |
| Defenses | High walls |

## People Groups

| Group | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Nobility | Social Class | The wealthy members of [[Audran]] society. However these nobles are not like nobility of other cities half made up of conventional nobles of good rapport, and half made up of eclectic individuals who made some great success in the city. These two types of nobles blend in court to create a fast paced, gossip-filled knot within society. |
| Commoners | Social Class | The working class of the city. Poverty can move like waves through the fluid economy of the city. It is always a challenge for the common folk to keep their heads above water. |
| Beggars | Social Class | Individuals who could not keep up with, or getting a foot hold within the city's merciless environment. Many beggars exist within the city. Life is hard and competitive amongst this class. |
| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |
| Criminals | Criminal | A massive criminal network exists within the city. Many gangs, alliances, and rivalries fill the alleys of the city with violence and thievery. The underbelly of [[Audran]] is a world of its own, and must be traversed carefully. Its structure is nearly as complex and ever changing as its noble courts. Some of its major players are: The Roving Gang, The Tiefling Mafia, The Unruly, The Nakaza, and many more. |
| Inquisitors | Law Enforcement | A class of highly trained individuals from [[The First Bastion]], sent to bring order to the city. These high ranking members of the city guard aim to clean up the streets and eliminate crime. However they have been at it for quite some time with little net change. |
| Students | Academic Station | Students who attend [[Charenbridge]], an academic institution of the [[Arcanum]], a branch of [[The University]]. These individuals are known to come from all backgrounds (usually low born) as [[Charenbridge]] admits all students and does not charge tuition. |
| Professors | Academic Station | Staff who teach at [[Charenbridge]], an academic institution of the [[Arcanum]], a branch of [[The University]]. These individuals vary from practiced writers, to skilled and deadly [[Arcanists]]. |

## Authority
The city is ruled by High Lord Beld Bordana. A young dwarven ruler who many feel is incompetent. He is charged with taming the untamable city of [[Audran]]. Luckily for him he has the Inquisitors at his disposal.

The crown does what it can to strike order within the city, but it is like herding cats. No matter the rules and efforts put into stilling the chaos, someone finds a way around it. Or if there isn't a way around it, they make one.

In some parts of the city, the criminals are as much of a ruling force as the crown, if not more. It does citizens well to keep their noses clean in regards to both parties.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In current day and age, the city is a massive place where anyone can slip away into. They will find some notch or corner they fit into within its wall. It may not be a good palace, but they will fit in somewhere.

## Historical Importance
Once the beacon of prosperity within [[The Three Corners]], the city was struck with a horrible destruction during an event called The Day of Madness.

## The Destruction of Audran - The Day of Madness
In the late [[First Age]], [[Audran]] was the largest and most prosperous city in all of [[Zol]]. As the capital of [[Laenwalde]], it acted as a hub of commerce, politics, academia, and culture. This beacon of hope changed instantly when [[The Castle of Bodies]] suddenly appeared in the sky on The Day of Madness.

Before the event, none knew of [[The Castle of Bodies]]' existence. One of the strange [[Void Gods]], with a particular goal of random destruction.

When it appeared, it blocked out the sun and exercised its influence on the minds of [[Audran]]'s people. Almost all who were exposed to it were immediately pushed to madness and violence. The city quickly became a bloody riot. Friend turned on friend as everyone within began to do all they could to destroy the city and its people.

Brave heroes dispatched themselves as quickly as they could, luckily none of which were driven mad upon arrival, as it seemed the cognitive effect from the Void God was only exercised at its moment of arrival. They fought the Void God, as it dispatched an army of monstrous demons with horrific physiology from within its body.

The heroes did all they could to wound the strange being, in a manner similar to razing a city. Then without warning, the city vanished.

Those who were driven mad by it suddenly regained their senses, but the damage had been done. In a matter of hours [[Audran]] was put to ruins. The memory of the event left the city with the brand of being cursed.

The vast majority left the city, and it remained a ghost town for generations. However, a fair portion of its buildings were reasonably intact. Eventually, the wounds turned to scars, people began to return to the city.

Originally only unorganized factions of bandits, forlorn, and nomads. As more people arrived a society naturally began to reform. After a few generations, the governing bodies of [[Laenwalde]] recognized it as a city once again.

It had been rebuilt to a degree. Fallen down sections of stone walls were rebuilt with lumber, rubble piles were stacked and reused as building material, and waterways were cleared of pollutants.

Later research and divination revealed [[The Castle of Bodies]]' nature. The attack was deemed as a freak occurrence, and people began to call [[Audran]] home again. However it scars would never be forgotten and it was no longer the capital. [[Kahdinacht]] had taken its place as the defacto capital, and [[Heliodor]] would later be its successor.
