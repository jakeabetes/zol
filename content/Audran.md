---## The Destruction of Audran - The Day of Madness
In the late [[First Age]], [[Audran]] was the largest and most prosperous city in all of [[Zol]]. As the capital of [[Laenwalde]], it acted as a hub of commerce, politics, academia, and culture. This beacon of hope changed instantly when [[The Castle of Bodies]] suddenly appeared in the sky on The Day of Madness.

Before the event, none knew of [[The Castle of Bodies]]' existence. One of the strange [[Void Gods]], with a particular goal of random destruction.

When it appeared, it blocked out the sun and exercised its influence on the minds of [[Audran]]'s people. Almost all who were exposed to it were immediately pushed to madness and violence. The city quickly became a bloody riot. Friend turned on friend as everyone within began to do all they could to destroy the city and its people.

Brave heroes dispatched themselves as quickly as they could, luckily none of which were driven mad upon arrival. They fought the Void God, as it dispatched an army of monstrous demons with horrific physiology.

The heroes did all they could to wound the strange being, in a manner similar to razing a city. Then without warning, the city vanished.

Those who were driven mad by it suddenly regained their senses, but the damage had been done. In a matter of hours [[Audran]] was put to ruins. The memory of the event left the city with the brand of being cursed.

The vast majority left the city, and it remained a ghost town for generations. However, most of its buildings were relatively intact, as [[The Castle of Bodies]]' efforts largely damaged the population directly. Eventually, the wounds turned to scars, people began to return to the city.

Originally only unorganized factions of bandits, forlorn, and nomads. As more people arrived a society naturally began to reform. Eventually the governing bodies of [[Laenwalde]] recognized it as a city once again.

It had been rebuilt to a degree, Fallen down sections of stone walls were rebuilt with lumber, rubble piles were stacked and reused as building material, and waterways were cleared of pollutants.

Later research and divination revealed [[The Castle of Bodies]]' nature. The attack was deemed as a freak occurrence, and people began to call [[Audran]] home again. However it scars would never be forgotten and it was no longer the capital. [[Kahdinacht]] had taken its place as the defunct capital, and [[Heliodor]] would later be its successor.
