title: "Enchantment (School)"

[[Enchantment (School)]]is one of the many [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves manipulating the mind of a target. This can be used to aid or hinder said target. This is not to be confused with the [[Artificers]] practice of [[Enchantment]].

These manipulations of the mind can be used to change a targets disposition, hypnotize them into performing a singular or set of actions, or even alter memories. Some uses of the magic are so strong it can even convince one's mind to stop all processes of life, killing the target.

Usage of enchantment magic is considered a crime in many places such as [[Laenwalde]], [[Kapesh]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Holocene]], and in [[The Glassius Reach]].
