title: "Enchantment (School)"
---[[Enchantment (School)]] [[Magic]] is one of the many [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves manipulating the mind of a target. This can be used to aid or hinder said target. This is not to be confused with the practice of some [[Artificers]], also known as [[Enchantment]].

These manipulations of the mind can be used to change a targets disposition, hypnotize them into performing a singular or set of actions, alter memories. They can even convince one's mind to stop all processes of life, killing the target.

Usage of enchantment magic is considered a crime in [[Laenwalde]], [[Kapesh]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Holocene]], and in [[The Glassius Reach]].
