---*What remains of the Great Old One, [[Goh'zul]]. The last remaining fragment of the being in which [[Zol]] resides, manifesting as one of its [[Planes]]*

The Duty of [[The Watcher in The Door]], the prison of The Great Old One, what Zolaen scripture describes as the greatest threat ever conquered.

Said to be a massive stretch of obsidian flecked with gold. Oblivion is home to the remaining fragment of [[Goh'zul]]'s soul called [[The Wretch]]. A being of endless hunger.

All that is known of Oblivion comes from the [[Zolaen Gods]]. They claim to hide it away from mortals, [[The Watcher]] protecting its sole entrance called 'The Door'.

No mortal has ever proven its existence. Academics debate if it truly exists or not, but religion speaks of it regularly. Much of theology revolves around the idea of its existence. Some believe it lies beyond [[Holyfield]].
