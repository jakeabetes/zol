# Void Gods
*Fear the depth of Zol, for not even the Gods know what horrors lurk in its void*

The Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]]. They seek to torture, conquer, or even destroy [[Zol]]. They hate all other [[Gods]], and even have a small degree of in-fighting. However there has been record of them aiding one another as well.

The Gods listed here are only the known gods of the void. Academics theorize many other horrors may exist, and these are the only ones that have been recorded.
