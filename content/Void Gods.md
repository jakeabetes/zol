title: "Void Gods"
---*Fear the depth of Zol, for not even the Gods know what true horrors lurk in its void*

The Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]]. They seek to torture, conquer, or even destroy [[Zol]]. They hate all other [[Gods]], and even have a small degree of in-fighting. However there has been record of them aiding one another in their grand effort to dismantle [[Zol]].

Some believe these beings to follow the guidance of a dark king known as [[The Shroud of the Void]], or the force known as [[The Anti-Trinity]], while others theorize it to be a realm of true chaos with no clear dominating power. In either case, the actions of these beings haunt [[Zol]] and shape its history.

The Gods listed here are only the known gods of the void. Academics theorize many other horrors may exist, and these are the only ones that have been recorded or largely recognized in the stories of mortals.
