# The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from the Grand Nothing
A highly controversial text on the archeological discoveries of [[The Grand Nothing]]. Written by Hammond Leduran, Eldon Viconell, and Irid Mathrapp. The three human scholars, of [[The Kybis Assembly]], conducted many expeditions, excavations, and investigations into Old Zol. They compiled the works of many individuals to create a comprehensive publication regarding their discoveries.

The majority of the resulting work contained maps, drawings, and detailed descriptions of what was found. The final few chapters of the book drew conclusions from the data. Said conclusions were speculative, but sparked much controversy.

The summary of the conclusions drawn are as follows:
- [[Old Zol]] was a highly advanced society that had a comprehensive understanding of [[The First Tongue]], [[The Old Tongue]], and [[The Trinity]] itself. 
- Their usage of [[Magic]] was described as [[Great Magic]]. One will to each of the races
	- [[Humans]] and [[Arcana]]
	- [[Elves]] and [[Viridescence]]
	- [[Dwarves]] and [[Observance]]
- No evidence of races other than [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] were discovered. Indicating the other races did not exist before [[The Undoing]].
- All three races of [[Old Zol]] lived for centauries, now only [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] live this long.
- The effect of [[The Undoing]] caused humans to lose their [[Great Magic]], and brought the [[Off-Human]] races into existence.

Since its publication, many have based their beliefs on these conclusions. Causing racial discriminations and division between the races of [[Zol]]. Unfortunately no further evidence has been found to disprove these conclusions.
