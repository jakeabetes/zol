---![[The Glassius Reach.jpg]]

Geographically and politically isolated, The Reach is cut off from the rest of the world by [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]] and the treacherous [[Wrath Wastes]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] is the most alien of the kingdoms within [[The Three Corners]]. Both its wilderness, and its people are unlike any other. Inhabited by [[Changelings]], and scorned by all of [[Zol]], the Reach holds many mysteries.

The most notable mystery being [[The Oldshards]]. Two strange relics which the culture and society of [[Changelings]] is based around.

## Cities
- [[Yorn et Gaul]] - The Broken City
- [[Corinth]] - The Bastion of Tradition

## Wilderness and Climate
The Reach is as dangerous as it is awe inspiring. It is alien to the rest of [[Zol]]. Strange radially symmetric plants growing in consistent mathematical patterns, flowers and mushrooms the size of buildings, pebbles that are so light the drift on the air when kicked, and rivers and lakes that are impossibly deep.

The Reach is very cold due to its northern climate, but does contain some weather patterns and hot springs that allow for lush flora and fauna to survive.

## History
[[The Glassius Reach]] was not discovered by the outside world for some time after [[The Awakening]]. When rumors began about an [[Off-Human]] people who have the ability to take any form of their choosing, the grim folk-lore essentially created itself. Common folk began to accuse their friends and family of being '[[Changelings]]' who had killed and eaten their friends. A hidden threat that had come to their city to steal faces and coins.

Eventually, emissaries from the western world began to interact with The Reach. With increased exposure, the mythos around the [[Changelings]] began to dissipate a bit. However, the public fear toward the kingdom remained.

Some brave [[Changelings]] venture out into the the other kingdoms as proud members of their race, but most who do so under their natural disguise mimicking another of [[Zol]]'s [[Races]]. Their disguises a necessary precaution against many of [[Zol]]'s foreigners.   

During the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]] masking as important members of western society. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would grow to fame as the [[Western War]].

Fought mostly in the treacherous Pits of Zeralis, this war increased in intensity over a relatively short period and eventually amounted in the destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and the emergence of [[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]]. A [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin who protects [[The Glassius Reach]] with his life.

One of the major results of this war was the loss of [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]]. An object so central to the culture of [[Changelings]] that it has caused irreparable damage to their religion and culture. One recent example of this is some [[Changelings]] born within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] do not have the ability to change their form.

Despite the hardship and discrimination the people of [[The Glassius Reach]] have faced, they have gone to great lengths to preserve their way of life. The [[Changelings]] have succeeded well in upholding their culture considering what has happened to them.

## Inhabitants
The population of [[The Glassius Reach]] is made up of almost entirely [[Changelings]].  A people with a very reserved, unique culture.

There are two things one would notice when first arriving in the cities of The Reach:
- **Extreme Formality** - The people of The Reach have very set traditions, and procedures called [[The Pattern]]. The Pattern keeps society well mannered, fair, and efficient. The Pattern determines things like how long one should stay at a host's house after eating dinner, how much one is allowed to drink at a wine house, and even important things like deciding a ruler. Ignoring these formalities is seen as extremely rude, and in many cases infractions against the rules of [[The Pattern]] are a punishable offence. The pattern stems from the influence of [[The Oldshards]] seeming to favor some individuals more than others. Over many generations scholars and philosophers have tried to determine the factors that cause this favor. The resulting research is what shaped [[The Pattern]]. It is half based in empirical evidence, and half in personal belief. It is a thing debated by many.
- **True Forms, Pure Forms, and Pure Voice** - [[Changelings]] posses the ability to alter their physical form to any humanoid shape of their choosing, given they are still of the same approximate size and shape. This alteration is not the use of [[Illusion]] magic like many assume, but actual [[Transmutation]] of the physical body, even modifying things like sex and metabolism, and the very [[Matter]] they are made from. This creates an interesting dynamic where people have the ability to appear however they choose, and can even mask as other people. To combat the obvious challenges this poses, as well as introduce a concept of individuality, [[Changelings]] will often spend their youth conceptualizing an appearance called a **True Form**. A highly unique, detailed, and beautiful appearance that is very difficult to counterfeit. This form is seen as sacred, and is to be respected by all other [[Changelings]]. One's true form may make them appear as if they are made of translucent crystal, finely made porcelain, woodgrain, or anything one can reasonably imagine. [[Changelings]] use this form to identify themselves amongst their own society. It is illegal to attempt to counterfeit someone else's True Form, and it is extremely rare one shows their true form outside of The Reach's Cities, especially to outsiders.
  
  [[Changelings]] can also be identified by two other means: their **Pure Form**, and Pure **Voice**. These two traits being ones physical appearance at birth, and natural tonality of voice. These are seen as sacred and highly important to the [[Changelings]]. Some compare showing one's pure form to the concept of nakedness, but it is not quite that. There is no shame in doing so, publicly or privately, but one would not do so without thought the same way one would not wear a wedding gown at a funeral. The occasion must be fitting.
  
  **Pure Voice** is another category of identification. Since [[Changelings]] can alter their appearance at will, physical traits are not as treasured when it comes to things like attraction or conventional beauty. However modifying one's voice, especially in a way that is pleasant sounding, is quite difficult for a Changeling. This makes having a beautiful voice an ideal within The Reach's society.

There are also a very small number of non-changeling peoples within The Reach. However these individuals had to go to great lengths to be welcomed into the xenophobic society of [[Changelings]]. They must follow strict rules and are always viewed as outsiders.

## Government, Economy, and Laws
The Kingdom of The Reach is governed by 2 individuals (one for each city) known as [[Shardcallers]]. Each is supported by their own council, all of which are democratically elected and extensively tested for their positions. Those in positions of leadership are viewed in a unique way within The Reach.

Elected officials are seen as being 'owned' by the people of the city. The live very strict lifestyles where their whole days are scheduled out. Things like dining and recreation time are predetermined for them. Their homes are open to the public (and highly guarded). Citizens can come watch the leadership eat, sleep, and work if they choose to do so. While this sounds demeaning to outsiders it is the highest honor of the [[Changelings]]. Those who seek these positions spend their entire lives training for the opportunity.

The [[Shardcallers]] of The reach are Yemodhan Surrite of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and Osieur Xetac of [[Corinth]].

The Reach has a socialist approach to its economy, and uses its own denomination of crystalline [[Currency]] called a [[Glassmark]] which is divided into 4 types of coin:
- **Quartermark** - A small clear crystal cut into hexagons from quartz called, bearing similar value to a copper coin
- **Halfmark** - A medium sized yellow crystal cut into pentagons from citrine, bearing similar value to a silver coin
- **Nearmark** - A medium sized green crystal cut into squares from fluorite, bearing similar value to a gold coin
- **Fullmark** - A large sized opaque crystal cut into triangles from celestine, bearing similar value to a platinum coin

The [[Glassian Laws]] are very strict, but well respected by most. [[The Glassius Reach]] at one time, had the lowest crime rate of all the kingdoms. Now that has begun to change with the many years of hardship in [[Yorn et Gaul]].

## Arts, Culture, and Religion
Art is very important to the culture of The Reach. Individuals will become career artists to try and encapsulate the many complex factors and ideals within their society. Visual arts like painting are prevalent within the cities, but more commonly artists focus on singing and [[Form Art]].

Singing holds a special importance within The Reach because of the importance of one's Pure Voice. Vocalists will occasionally play with instrumental accompaniment, but more commonly will sing acapella in grand opera-like performances. Frequently done in a theatrical manner.

[[Form Art]] is a changeling practice of altering ones own form into beautiful or interesting ways. This is done to express emotions or for general entertainment.

The general society around The Reach is very strict, utilitarian, well mannered. Individuals will generally try and keep an indifferent demeanor and won't stick their nose into other peoples business. [[Changelings]] are very proud beings, to offend them is a very quick way to become an outcast.

The Reach is one of two kingdoms that does not implement [[Trains]] within its borders. Unlike the other kingdom who does not implement [[Trains]], [[The Ward]], The Reach does use [[Iron Light]]. They merely have not implemented the infrastructure. The [[Artificers]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] are behind in terms of advancements due to the isolation they face.

## Academics and Magic
Academics and magic are exclusively taught through [[The Eelynn]], a college of two campuses with one in each city. These schools offer teaching to all youth ages 5-18. Those who are promising academics may go further in their scholarship, pursuing magic and/or greater studies.

The Reach also has access to a unique manifestation of the will of [[Observance]]. This is obtained through interfacing with [[The Oldshards]]. What little is understood about this phenomena is extremely well guarded and is not known by many. Those who do have abilities granted by [[The Oldshards]] are quite powerful.

## Political Climate
[[The Glassius Reach]] has faced much destruction in its recent history. The Kingdom has a general hatred for the outside world, especially [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]]. The much of the [[The Three Corners]] returns the same sentiment. The Reach is however a small kingdom compared to its enemies, so it remains well defended in its borders.

The City of [[Yorn et Gaul]] faces a grim present. [[The Apex]], an object central and holy to the city was lost in the [[Western War]]. However the importance of this object was so great to these people. They still worship the grounds where it was once held. They leave much of their holy buildings in their war-torn state as a remined of what they faced. Many seek to restore what was lost while others feel that the kingdom needs to change to adapt to the new world.

Recently, some [[Changelings]] within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] are born without the ability to alter their form. Many think this is due to the loss of [[The Apex]].

## Military
The kingdom has a comparatively small military, but there is no other army who would so willingly die for its kingdom. [[The Glassius Reach]] stood its ground for extended battles many times during the [[Western War]] despite having loosing numbers. This is due to the highly defensible position, and extremely hostile environment that does not favor outsiders. It also helps that [[Changelings]] can appear as their foes for ambush attacks. The kingdom has a relatively small navy as well, but they are not very vulnerable to sea based attacks due to the rough seas near Zhal.

## Borders
The Reach borders the kingdom of:
- [[Gethsemane]] via the [[Wrath Wastes]]

It also borders the wilds of:
- [[The Blades]] mountain range
- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]
- [[Holyfield]]

and has its coast on:
- [[The Narrow Sea]]
