Known for their jovial and free spirited nature, [[Yanneran]] is the most liberal of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Yanneran has domain over the beauty drawn from the world, and the celebration of it.

## Depiction
[[Yanneran]] is depicted in three ways. One form taken appears as a large, portly, bearded man of olive skin and smiling face. Another depicts a well-endowed woman of purple hair and similar skin covered in tattoos that shift and change constantly, commonly wearing ever-flowing robes of white.

In their most awestriking form, [[Yanneran]] appears as a gleaming spirit of purple and green light. Gazing upon the latter form causes an influx of artistic visions and a state akin to intoxication via alcohol.

## Symbolism
[[Yanneran]] and their followers utilize the symbol of a grapevine bearing 5 Grapes. One for each of the main art forms:
- Visual
- Architectural 
- Literary
- Performance
- Culinary

As well as a curled stem to depict the growth of the arts.

## Behavior
[[Yanneran]] is known for joy, celebration, and contemplative appreciation for the arts. They are also know to be quite mischievous in their influence. [[Yanneran]] is not easily provoked, but when they are, they are know to be swift and destructive in their retaliation.

## Realm
[[Yanneran]] resides in an outer plane known as [[The Palace of Drole]]. A seemingly endless structure of beautiful marble architecture and ornate decoration. Courtyards, pools and gardens dot its grounds.

The souls of the dead who have appealed to [[Yanneran]] fill this palace. Partying for all of eternity.

## Worshipers
The worshipers of [[Yanneran]] do not live their lives like normal clergy. These individuals are known as free spirits who travel far and wide. Spreading joy, and creating art. 

Few temples of [[Yanneran]] exist in [[Zol]] for this reason, and those that do exist are strange, but beautiful places.
