# Religion
In [[Zol]] religion provides safety, power and information. The presence of the [[Gods]] is very well known, but their methods, intentions, and origins are largely a mystery.

Religion in Zol takes many forms. Some undergo their practice as an individual journey, or participate in one of the many [[Religious Organizations]]. There many churches, sects, cults, traditions, and practices that all have their own unique belief systems to make sense of the complex world of [[Zol]] and its mysterious [[Gods]].

## "God" as a catch-all term for powerful beings
There are many beings who's primary focus is to rule over some dominion as a God. However, these are not the only beings that society refers to as a god. Any being of extreme power may be given this title, despite their methods.

## Major Beliefs
There is a vast number of perspectives from which [[Zol]] and its [[Gods]] are understood. Most of which can be summarized by these 6 categories. Ordered from most common to least common:

- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief
	- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[Zolaen Gods]] created [[Zol]] and are the true and holy rulers of it. This belief system also subscribes to the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are malicious and that they caused the [[Desolation]]. It also entails that the [[Wayward Gods]] are dangerous and not to be trusted.
	- Followers of this belief may worship one or many of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Regardless of their specific method of worship, it is generally thought that one should pay respect and worship to all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] from time-to-time.
	- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[Zolaen Gods]].

- ### Trinity-Centric Belief
	- This belief system is based in the general idea that the pantheons of [[Gods]] are not the true ultimate power. They instead believe that [[The Trinity]] itself is the only thing deserving of worship. In this system, the [[Gods]] are either mere extensions of [[The Trinity]], or false gods. This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Great Deceiver]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.
	- Followers of this belief may worship [[The Trinity]] as a whole or some specific manifestation of it. Like the [[Church of Three Fires]].
	- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[The Trinity]].

- ### Wanderer-Centric Belief
	- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are more of guardians rather than [[Gods]]. They are thought to have come to [[Zol]] to protect civilization from the unchecked wrath of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. As per this belief system, the [[Desolation]] is seen as the fault of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Those who subscribe to this theory also believe that the [[Wayward Gods]] and [[Wordbearers]] are not all inertly bad.
	- Followers of this belief see [[The Wandering Gods]] more as companions rather than omnipotent rulers, guiding them in their struggles. Those who seek out [[The Wandering Gods]] may do so with just one, many, or to their leader [[All]].

- ### Polytheism
	- This belief system recognizes each god as an individual being, and does not judge them based on their pantheon. Followers of this belief typically focus on a select god, or small group of gods based on the individuals selection. This system typically operates under the assumption that the [[Desolation]] was caused by the [[Gods]], but it is not know which gods. So judgement is not cast.

- ### Atheism
	- This belief system operates based on the assumption that mortals need not revere [[Gods]], as they are merely beings. Their power does not make them holy, merely more present in [[Zol]]. The specific ideas differ from person to person, but largely revolves around skepticism towards information about the gods divined through worship.

- ### Void Worship
	- This belief system is based on the idea of sacrifice in exchange for power from the [[Void Gods]]. A taboo practice in all of society, this belief is a dangerous and dark practice. Individuals who practice this faith are known for having twisted world views.
