- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief
	- *Roughly 40% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*

This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Anti-Trinity]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.
