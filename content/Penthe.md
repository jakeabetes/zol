![[Penthe skyline.png]]

[[Penthe]] (pronounced *pen-thay*), is a city built to honor the [[Zolaen Gods]]. A home so beautiful, it has garnered the endorsement of [[Iyowne]], a powerful angel. Founded in the mid [[First Age]] by a group of devout warrior monks called [[The Undari]], [[Penthe]] is now a beautiful city located on the slopes of the Se'dir River Valley. It is the westmost city in all the Three Corners.

A powerful [[Iron Light]] pump moves water up from the Se'dir River to the city's highest point, where it then flows back down through constructed canals and waterfalls all throughout the area. This infrastructure gives much utility to the population of the city and their day to day operations. Of these operations, the most notable is [[The First Bastion]], a wing of the [[Observum]] where warriors of [[Laenwalde]] are trained to defend their kingdom, and uphold the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].

## Overview
| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city is a valiant, holy, and beautiful place. Its churches and [[The First Bastion]] provide for all who are in need. The most skilled fighters of [[Laenwalde]]'s army are trained within the city. For those who are in the city's favor it is one of the safest places within [[Zol]]. |
| Main Challenge | The city worships the [[Zolaen Gods]] to a degree that is borderline fanatical, this stems from the city's history and its association with [[The First Bastion]]. In its current society these shared beliefs create a community for those who hold them, but drives away anything else. Non-believers, sinners, or those who do not devote themselves well enough are shunned as outsiders. Myth and rumor paints a darker image where these outsiders are not only shunned, but culled. However there is little proof of this, and would depend heavily on the religious-political state of the city's leadership. |

| The Shunned | Non Zolaen-Centric/Secular Group | Citizens who do not fit the ideals of the church. Members of society who are outcast by others for things like differing beliefs, partial devotion, or sins. Those who are shunned by the masses are rarely welcomed back into their previous circles. Even those close to one who has been deemed an outsider will be treated differently. |

Helmed by [[Blade Lord Kive Bidell]]. The institution's aim is to train powerful warriors and clerics to defend and uphold the kingdom and the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].

## Authority
The city is under rule of High Lord Draezus Wolf and his council. The city is known for respecting the crown of [[Laenwalde]] so truly and honorably, there are rhymes and jokes written about it.

Second to the High Lord, is [[Blade Lord Kive Bidell]]. The Blade Lord is leader of [[The First Bastion]]. The Blade Lord responds only to the command of High Lords and the King himself.

Beyond that, rank within the church is just as seriously as government rank. If a priest were to command something of you, it would be the same as if an officer were to. However you would have no *legal* precedent to follow it, just a serious societal on.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In modern day, much of [[The University]]'s operations concerning the [[Observum]] occur within the city. [[The First Bastion]] focuses much of its resources on training adept fighters to venture out into [[Laenwalde]] and the world beyond to act on behalf of the King and the [[Zolaen Gods]].

## Historical Importance
When the city was originally founded by [[The Undari]], it was a place where martial skill was of great cultural importance. This ideal has transformed over time along with teaching of Zolaen-Centric beliefs to form a very devout people.

So devout, it garnered the attention of [[Iyowne]], a powerful angel of [[The Watcher]]. In the late [[First Age]], the angel visited the city during sunset. He spoke well of the peoples devotion, and told them their city exemplified the ideals [[The Watcher]] aimed to instill all across [[Zol]]. Those who witnessed [[Iyowne]] we granted high station within the church.

While some doubt the event ever taking place, its effect in the city's culture has remained strong event to modern day. The people of [[Penthe]] conserve old beliefs in an aim to stay true in the eyes of the [[Gods]].

## Other Things of Note
- The people of the city depend very little upon [[Apparatum]] and other magical objects. This is due to a widely held belief that those sorts of proclivities are not needed when one is cared for by the gods. Many generations ago they were outlawed, but convenience and abundance has eroded away those principals. Now most commoners will use them when necessary, and nobility tend to employ whatever they deem fit. The secondary effect to this is it is difficult to purchase things of this nature in the city. One is better of catching a train to [[Ryze]].
