title: "The Rings of Tarot"

The Rings of Tarot are a set of magically forged rings created by the [[The Tarot]] people during the founding of [[Zessgorn]]. These rings were meant to be given to the leaders, and protectors of the city. Granting them [[Magic]] power of leadership, and strength.

The societal benefit was functional at a time, but in modern history they have fallen from their previous grace. Bastardized by the greedy. What was once a pedestal for the city to stand upon has become a crutch for [[Zessgorn]].

## Powers of The Rings
There are three types of rings. Herald Rings, Strength Rings, Lesser Rings. Herald Rings bestow power of leadership, and information. Strength Rings bestow power of physical ability and/or magical capacity. The Rings of Tarot were created via [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. Unfortunately, most of which have been lost
