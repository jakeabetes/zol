*The cognitive plane that overlays all [[Planes]] of [[Zol]]*

The Ethereal, the Realm of Cognition, the Plane of the Soul. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is a frequency of existence that acts almost like a true plane of its own. It is present wherever sapient life is.

It is possible to enter [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even move through it. Typically when one does this they leave behind their physical body and move through this space as an astral projection of ones self.

The realm is described as appearing like the physical world draped in translucent cloth. There are said to be beings who live in [[The Ethereal Plane]], but spending extended time here can cause great damage to ones physical body, so little is known about it.
