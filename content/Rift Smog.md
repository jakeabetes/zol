title: "Rift Smog"
---A toxic off-gas produced by the regrowth of [[Rift Iron]]. Its effects are a slow, and painful degradation of the body. It causes a sickness called [[Rift Lung]] which causes damage to the skin, internal organs, and eyes. As well as a painful cough. It often produces other sickness as well since it reduces the body's natural defenses. These sickness are often what causes death for those who suffer from [[Rift Lung]].

[[Artificers]] of [[Tenzentak]] were able to create massive filters that remove the necrotic properties from the gas using the radiant properties of sunlight. However this means that they need to be in direct sun to function, so they do not aid those who live within the rifts.
