title: "Dreadslayers"
---*Bearing the burden of Iron and Silver*
![[Fort Bramble.png]]

An enclave of skilled monster slayers who protect the northern regions of [[Kapesh]] from dangerous monsters who migrate down from [[The Witchlands]]. Members join at a young age, and are typically those who are left on the wayside by society. They are taught the sword, bow, and magic. But combat is not the full extent of their expertise. They are also educated on history, [[Alchemy]], and monsterology.

They are not a very well known group, even within their region. This is due to their small numbers, and intentionally low profile. However, those who do know of them usually identify them by their mutations. [[Dreadslayers]] are given enhanced physical and mental abilities through Alchemical Mutations and unconventional magic. A process known as **The Transaction**. This gives them a few identifiable physical traits such as: taste buds on the pallet of one's mouth, purple tinted keratin debris under the fingernails, honey comb like patterns forming under the skin during bruising. Though most notable are their orange-yellow eyes.

## Values
*"Our predecessors picked up the sword long ago, fighting for a way of life within North [[Kapesh]]. If we put down the sword we risk the lives of many, and squander the efforts of [[Dreadslayers]] long past."*

The Dreadslayer creed is one of duty. They acts as the line of defense which protects North [[Kapesh]] from getting overrun by monsters from [[The Witchlands]]. Their task is one without end. Culling monster populations. It is a dangerous, and weighty task. They are trained to make highly educated decisions on how to best deal with crises involving monsters. They are also known to loyally support their allies, especially in a fight. Lastly, they are not allowed to involve themselves in political matters. [[Dreadslayers]] see themselves as a necessity to society, and putting a barrier between the people and [[Dreadslayers]] would jeopardize their mission.

## Origin
It is not precisely known when or how [[Dreadslayers]] came to be. Many speculate that they originated during the [[Beast Ire]] plague.

## Structure
[[Dreadslayers]] do not have a very structured hierarchy. The chain of command that is in place is based on experience. Those with 50+ years of experience are all sort of seen around the same level of authority. Though all [[Dreadslayers]] fall under the command of a single individual, Danray.   
- ### Leadership
	- Danray (no surname) is one of the oldest and most skilled [[Dreadslayers]].
- ### Size
	- Approximately 40 members
- ### Rules
	- Loyalty to ones compatriots, political agnosticism, upholding of one's duty.
- ### Admission
	- [[Dreadslayers]] are adopted at a young age. Usually from orphanages, or purchased out of [[Slavery]]. This is because **The Transaction**, the process which mutates one into a **Dreadslayer** must be done during adolescence.
- ### Symbolism
	- An emblem of a cat-like eye. Representing the recognizable eye of a Dreadslayer.
	- They are often associated with Iron and Silver. As they must carry weaponry made from both to fight specific types of monsters.
