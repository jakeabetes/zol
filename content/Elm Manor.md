---# Elm Manor
*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

The cosmic estate of the greatest wizard to ever live, [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].

A vast and magical home. It is guarded by arcane creations that are famously lethal to any who attempt to enter Draedon's realm uninvited.

Situated on a floating island amongst [[The Ethos]], Draedon spends his time working away studying the secrets of the universe.

His many years doing this have filled his home with oddities one could only dream of. Many academics would give their left arm just to see it.

Draedon keeps a magical observatory that lets him peer into much of [[Zol]] from the comfort of his own plane. This allows him to live a very reclusive life.

Many other arcanists have made realms of their own similar in nature to [[Elm Manor]]. Despite their best efforts, none compare to the wonder of Draedon's creation.
