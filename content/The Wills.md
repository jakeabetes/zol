title: "The Wills"
---# The Wills
[[The Wills]] are the three known possible manifestations of [[Magic]] sourced from [[The Trinity]].
- [[Observance]], [[Magic]] connected to gods or some other source of power itself other than nature
- [[Viridescence]], [[Magic]] connected to the power of [[Zol]]'s natural world
- [[Arcana]], [[Magic]] pulled from the unbound power that exists all throughout [[Zol]].

 All power in [[Zol]] must manifest in one of these ways. Power that is alien to [[Zol]] cannot exist within its realm without being first funneled through [[The Trinity]], unless the power itself is stronger than that of [[The Trinity]]. There is no record of this ever occurring.

The wills are typically accessed by [[Sapient Beings]] through the use of [[Vizir]] as the minor wills, or through the use of [[The Old Tongue]] as the greater wills.
