*Three planets amalgamated into Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Hovering in the skies of [[Zol]] are three barren planets floating with one another in a slow orbit. Sorrow, Majesty, and Luna.

The moons of [[Zol]] were once planets that were consumed by [[Goh'zul]] before his defeat. Their once life-covered surfaces were left to ruin within the stomach of the Great Old One.

Now, the three planets grace [[Zol]] with beautiful illumination during its nights. The barren landscape has begun to stir with life again as strange beings have made homes there.

## Sorrow
The smallest of the 3 moons. Sorrow is known for its yellow hue and planetary ring. The ruins of Sorrow are the most intact of the 3 moons, and house many treasures and secrets about [[The Cosmos]].

Monsters inhabit its surface making it very dangerous to traverse, but the few who have the power and drive to go there quest for its treasure.

## Majesty
The second largest of the trio, The Desert Moon. Majesty's surface is covered with vast dunes of white sand. While originally thought to be barren, it was discovered that deep below its surface lies caves full of valuable resources.

Great stellar expeditions have been made by powerful arcanists to harness these resources. Unfortunately these were rarely met with success as the planet is inhabited by colossal omnivorous worms.

## Luna
The largest of the three moons, The Shifting Fate. Luna has strange properties that baffle scholars to this day. Its stony, crater-covered surface warps and changes with each passing day.

During the late [[First Age]], academics noticed that they could predict the likelihood of incoming gales from [[The Storm Horizon]] based on the positions of craters on Luna's surface.

After monitoring it for many years, academics noticed patterns when comparing it to historical data. The noticed relationships with things like the economy, plagues, crop harvest, and even the rise and fall of fashion fads.

Academics have yet to devise a consistent way to predict the meanings of Luna's surface beyond the storms, and may never do so. Some [[Witches]] claim to be able to read her surface, but do not divulge their techniques, nor provide proof.

## The Forgotten Heavens
Amongst these three planets, a single divine realm was shared. [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a place once abandoned like the moons were, now homes one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[The Night Empress]] resides in the strange and celestial plane where she watches all who move under the light of [[The Moons]].

## Orbital patterns
Sorrow and Majesty orbit Luna. Luna herself remains stationary in [[Zol]]'s sky during night and day. [[The Moons]] are faint while [[The Sun]] is out, but vibrant and bright during the night.
