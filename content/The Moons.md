*Three planets amalgamated into Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Hovering in the skies of [[Zol]] are three barren planets floating with one another in a slow orbit. Sorrow, Majesty, and Luna.

The moons of [[Zol]] are thought to have once been planets that were consumed by [[Goh'zul]] before his defeat. Their previously life-covered surfaces were left to ruin within the stomach of the Great Old One.

Now, the three planets grace [[Zol]] with beautiful illumination during its nights. Their barren landscape has begun to stir with life again as strange beings have made homes there, and ancient things from eons past awaken to the disturbances.

## Sorrow
The smallest of the 3 moons. Sorrow is known for its yellow hue and planetary ring. The ruins of Sorrow are the most intact of the 3 moons, and house many treasures and secrets about [[The Cosmos]].

Few bear the power to travel to any of the moons. However those that reach sorrow have met monsters that inhabit its surface making it very dangerous to traverse, but the few who have the capacity and drive to go there quest for its treasure.

## Majesty
The second largest of the trio, and the brightest of the trio. The Desert Moon. Majesty's surface is covered with vast dunes of white sand. While originally thought to be barren, it was discovered that deep below its surface lies caves full of valuable mineral resources.

Great expeditions have been made by powerful arcanists in the past to harness these resources. Unfortunately, these were rarely met with success as the planet is inhabited by colossal omnivorous worms.

Majesty also has a large shadow that passes over its surface in a regular pattern. This makes the moon appear in different phases like: full, half, crescent and new. No one knows the exact nature of this ever flowing shadow, but it is central to many myths and legends. 

## Luna
The largest of the three moons, The Shifting Fate. Luna has strange properties that baffle scholars to this day. Its stony, crater-covered surface warps and changes with each passing day.

During the late [[First Age]], academics noticed that they could predict the likelihood of incoming gales from [[The Storm Horizon]] based on the positions of craters on Luna's surface.

After monitoring it for many years, academics noticed patterns when comparing it to historical data. The noticed relationships with things like the economy, plagues, crop harvest, and even the rise and fall of fashion trends amongst nobility.

Academics have yet to devise a consistent way to predict the meanings of Luna's surface beyond the storms, and may never do so. Some [[Witches]] claim to be able to read her surface, but do not divulge their techniques, nor provide proof.

## The Forgotten Heavens
Amongst these three planets, a single divine realm is shared. [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a place once abandoned like the moons were, now homes one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[The Night Empress]] resides in the strange and celestial plane where she watches all who move under the light of [[The Moons]].

## Orbital patterns
Sorrow and Majesty orbit Luna. Luna herself remains stationary in [[Zol]]'s sky during night and day. [[The Moons]] are faint in comparison to [[The Sun]] during the day, but vibrant and bright during the night.

Occasionally, [[The Sun]] will pass behind the moons, causing an eclipse.
