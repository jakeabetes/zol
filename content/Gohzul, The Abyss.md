title: "Goh'zul, The Abyss"
---
One of [[The Circle]]'s inheritors. The powerful, and ancient being who once possessed the power to create, cultivate, and consume worlds. [[Goh'zul]] now only exists as a corpse which contains both unimaginable power, and the world of [[Zol]].

[[Zolaen Scripture]] refers to [[Goh'zul]] as two parts. The first part is the being he was before he ascended to power as one of the [[Great Old Ones]]. This piece of him acted as his soul when he was at the peak of his might. The other piece of him is his body, an all consuming, massive being of pure darkness. The latter part is considered to be his power he gained from [[The Circle]].

Some event long before [[Zol]] came to be resulted in his defeat and the shattering of [[The Circle]]. Now, only his soul remains. In [[Zolaen Scripture]], this piece of him is called [[The Wretch]]. He is said to reside within the heart of his ancient form, a place called [[Oblivion]]. In the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[The Watcher in The Door]] defeated [[The Wretch]] before creating the world.
