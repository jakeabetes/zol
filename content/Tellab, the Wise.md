*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*
![[Tellab The Wise.png]]

He who understands all and seeks for others to do the same. Tellab, the Wise is a utilitarian god, who's mission is to give Zol the means to gain knowledge and wisdom and knowledge on their own. He has domain over the knowledge of the world, and how it is grown.

## Depiction
Tellab is depicted as an old humanoid man with flowing robes that dissipate into smoke. His face is often drawn as a kindly old man with a grey beard. While appearing with less grandeur than many of the other [[Zolaen Gods]],  his presence is still awe striking in its own quiet way.

## Symbolism
Denoted by the symbol of an inkwell bearing a small sun-like rune.

## Behavior
Known for guiding his followers in their learning both academic and philosophical. Tellab is known to never grant knowledge directly, but is thought to ask pointed questions in the back of mortals minds that guide them to the light of the truth. Believers see this as the path to true understanding, while skeptics think it to be manipulation.

Tellab is very tactful in his influence, sending envoys and followers on very exact missions. He always bases his decision in utilitarian morals, meaning he will choose destruction for some if it will save the many.

## Realm
Tellab resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]] spending his days in its grand archives that contain an uncountable amount of texts that can only be read by those who have been granted Tellab's favor in death.

## Worshipers
Followers of Tellab are typically found in academia and other forms of study. Temples constructed for his worship are almost always incorporated into studies, archives, and libraries.
