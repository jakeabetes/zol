*Zolaen God of The Sea, Major Deity*
![[Ohlit.png]]

Ohlit, the great spirit of the sea. One of the most magnificent of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Ohlit has domain over his creation, the most vast geographical feature of [[Zol]], the sea.

Ohlit is the guardian of [[Zol]] in its war against the darkness that lurks in the fathoms deep below the oceans surface. Where [[Zol]]'s border gives way to [[The Void]].

## Depiction
Ohlit appears as colossal sea creature of many forms. Most notably a jellyfish, whale, school of fish, or manta ray. Typically accompanied by a cast of creatures in the same, but smaller form as he.

## Symbolism
Denoted by a symbol of a manta ray with a sun on its back.

## Behavior
Ohlit pays mortals little mind compared to other [[Zolaen Gods]]. He focuses primarily on the defense of [[Zol]] from the dangers of [[The Void]], but does maintain the natural order of the sea. A place where mortals can find sustenance and a shore to make homes upon, but also maintains a level of danger to keep mortals in check, and a safe distance away from [[The Void]].

## Realm
[[Ohlit]] resides in [[The Immortal Ocean]], a plane of endless sea life.

## Worshipers
Followers of [[Ohlit]] live in costal regions and pay sacrifice and worship to the sea for good fortune and guidance. While those who sail pay great respect to [[Ohlit]], he is not the primary being of concern for sailors. That would be [[Ohlit]]'s children [[Ellyon and Aradon]].

## The Ocean
A constant war is waged between [[Void Gods]] and the [[Zolaen Gods]]. This is because those of [[The Void]] seek to return [[Zol]] to its primordial form known as the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The Ocean itself was created by [[Ohlit]] as a border between [[Zol]] and [[The Void]]. 

At the greatest depths of [[Zol]] exists fissures that lead into [[The Void]]. The Ocean covers many of these fissures and allows [[Ohlit]] to monitor anything that may try to bridge the gap between worlds.

The Sea-God sends armies of his creation to war against [[The Void]] in an endless effort to hold back the evils that lurk deep beneath [[Zol]].
