![[Ohlit the great jelly.png]]

Ohlit, the great spirit of the sea. One of the most magnificent of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Ohlit has domain over his creation, the most vast life-giving geographical component in all of [[Zol]], the sea. Ohlit is the guardian of [[Zol]] in its war against the darkness that lurks in the fathoms deep below the oceans surface. Where [[Zol]]'s border gives way to [[The Void]].

## Depiction
Ohlit appears as colossal sea creature of many forms. Most notably a jellyfish, whale, school of fish, or manta ray. Typically accompanied by a cast of creatures in the same, but smaller form as Ohlit.

## Symbolism
Denoted by a symbol of a manta ray with a sun on its back.

## Behavior
Ohlit pays mortals little mind compared to other [[Zolaen Gods]]. He focuses primarily on the defense of [[Zol]] from the dangers of [[The Void]], but does maintain the natural order of the sea. A place where mortals can find sustenance and a shore to make homes upon, but also maintains a level of danger to keep mortals in check, and a safe distance away from [[The Void]].

## Realm
[[Ohlit]] resides in [[The Immortal Ocean]], a plane of endless sea life.

## Worshipers
Followers of [[Ohlit]] live in costal regions and pay sacrifice and worship to the sea for good fortune and guidance. While those who sail pay great respect to [[Ohlit]], he is not the primary being of concern for sailors. That would be [[Ohlit]]'s children [[Ellyon and Aradon]].
