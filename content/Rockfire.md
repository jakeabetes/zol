---*The Volcanic City, Home to the Fire God [[Daetro]]*
![[Rockfire skyline.png]]

No city of The Three Corners is known to house one of the [[Gods]], save for [[Rockfire]]. The city was built in honor of the benevolent Fire God [[Daetro]]. Despite being located within [[Laenwalde]], a kingdom known for its worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]], the city is filled with devout worshipers of [[Daetro]] who is one of the [[Wayward Gods]]. The kingdom's religious doctrine has made an exception in the case of [[Daetro]]'s followers, as the minor god has a very kind demeanor and cares for his people. This hybridization of beliefs pushes the bounds of religion within [[Zol]], and makes for a perfect place of study for those within the [[Observum]], a branch of [[The University]] focused on the will of [[Observance]] and the behaviors of [[Gods]].

| Main Opportunity         | [[Rockfire]] is the only city within The Three Corners that home a physical manifestation of one of the [[Gods]]. The Fire God [[Daetro]] resides within the neighboring volcano, [[Ta'Dendor]]. A god residing on [[The Mortal Coil]] risks a great deal, but it allows [[Daetro]] to have a very close relationship with his followers. [[Daetro]] is only a minor god, but his power is still tremendous. His influence allows for the people of the city to live plentiful lives, and learn about the nature of [[Gods]] in a unique manner. However [[Daetro]]'s influence stops at the borders of the city's territory              |
| Main Challenge           | A being of such power and influence maintaining such a close and personal relationship with a city creates many unique opportunities. Sometimes it is very difficult navigating these opportunities as a mortal. [[Daetro]] does not give everything to his people. One of his core ideals is strength of self, he encourages this through perseverance through hardship. Another challenge is those who posses different beliefs feel pressured or even ostracized by the presence of a god so near to the city. Some have even gone as far as attempting to dismantle the systems and infrastructure that support [[Daetro]]'s worship. |

| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Nobility         | Social Class               | The wealthy members of the city. Upstanding members of local business or political station. Note that high rank in the Church does not give noble status due to systems of belief.                                                                     |
| Commoners        | Social Class               | The vast majority, this category contains everyone who is not nobility. The poorest are typically well cared for by the church.                                                                                                                        |
| Obsidian Priests | Religious Station          | Priests of The Church of [[Daetro]], rank is denoted by obsidian jewelry and adornments worn by the priests. The more peaks incorporated within the adornments, the higher the rank. The church is led by The Ash Gifted, who wears an obsidian crown. |
| Seekers          | Academic/Religious Station | Students of [[The Temple]], an institution of the [[Observum]], those who perform research and seek answers regarding [[Gods]]. Much effort goes into observing [[Daetro]], but the efforts of [[The Temple]] do not limit themselves to a single religion. [[Daetro]]'s presence merely makes for very readily available study. [[The Temple]] researches all they can of the [[Gods]].                                                                                                                |
| Askers           | Academic/Religious Station | Those of the [[The Temple]] who teach, similar to, but not exactly the same as a Professor.

## Authority
The city is overseen by High Lady Remeera Lorsel, but much influence over the city comes from [[Daetro]] through The Ash Gifted. Politically the crown rules the city, but even the king knows forcing the city one way or another is a tricky gambit. [[Daetro]] allows for the crowns presence within the city, but sees the city as his own.[[Daetro]] would protect the city, but would never fight on the crown's behalf.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]

## Modern Importance
Known by outsiders as a devout and mythical place, home to a strange and benevolent god. A place where mortals attempt to acquire an understanding of the [[Gods]] who rule over [[Zol]].

## Historical Importance
Rockfire has not changed much over its existence. It is one of the oldest city's in The Three Corners. Built by nomads who discovered [[Daetro]], and never conquered due to the god's protection.

## Other Things of Note
- There are no slaves within [[Rockfire]], legally they are allowed by the crown, but [[Daetro]]'s cultural influence has pushed away the practice entirely. Those who bring their slaves to the city are said to meet grim accidents.
