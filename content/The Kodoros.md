![[The Kodoros.png]]

A desert mountain range and canyon filled with reptilian beasts, sand worms,  bandits, and a strange magical plant called [[Larkleaf]] that is a potent ingredient in [[Alchemy]], and very precious to the people of [[Saen]].

Travelling further south in the region causes a great increase in temperature, to the point where it is no longer safe for life. In its far south regions, volcanic activity skyrockets.

Scattered all through out the canyon is remnants of ancient ruins. Slightly different to the other ruins scattered all about the rest of [[The Kulpis Desert]], no one knows when they date back to.

## Location
The range exists within:
- [[Saen]] of [[Laenwalde]]
- [[The Kulpis Desert]]
