---# Incana
[[Incana]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is quite rare, especially in its most powerful forms. It is magic that involves the manipulation of fate and probability. It focuses the path of [[Nodes]] along the 4th dimension rather than a specific usage of [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].

This manipulation of [[Nodes]] allows a user to effectively increase or decrease luck that is in their very near future. At its most powerful it can even weave prophecies and change destinies. 

Manifestations of [[Incana]] are not guaranteed to work. These manifestations must overpower the natural path of [[Zol]], and any other conflicting manifestations of [[Incana]]. Sometimes these contests between fates don't emerge with a clear winner, and the outcome lands somewhere between the conflicting paths.
