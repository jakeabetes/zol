# Triumvirate Battles
[[The Triumvirate]] nations, [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]], have a historic reputation for sparring with one another. Separated by [[The Narrow Sea]], these nations have warred from roughly annum 2600 to 4000. Initially sparked by [[Gethsemane]] enslaving humans who crossed into their territories, and [[Kapesh]] doing the same with [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. [[Kapesh]] offered an exchange of prisoners, which [[Gethsemane]] rejected.

This rejection sparked conflict between the nations that lasted centauries. It wavered in intensity over the years, and its core motivation changed from enslavement, to expansion, to resources, and finally religious differences. 

Few major effects surfaced from the battles. The city of [[Riverbridge]] constantly changed hands due to its location on the border, slaves were eventually traded between sides for their freedom, any many died in the extended conflict. However, the conflict did give a foothold for the [[Alderian Rebellion]].

## Peak of the Battles
The peak occurred during annum 3673. [[Gethsemane]] had sought the aid of a powerful being from [[The Void]] called [[The Maul Bearer]]. A demon of great strength who was to be given any territory he conquered as payment, so long as [[Gethsemane]] kept him unbound from [[The Void]]. The demon and his army destroyed the [[Kapesh]] city of [[Rello Arr]] and its surrounding territory, creating the West Scars.

[[Kapesh]] was able to kill the [[The Maul Bearer]] and his armies before they took [[Kierketholl]], but the attacks left [[Kapesh]] weak for generations. This weakness later gave way to the [[Alderian Rebellion]].

## Information on Slaves during the Battles
Enslavement of [[Humans]], [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] sparked the initial conflict, and later became a bargaining chip between sides. These slaves began to be treated more as high valued prisoners than slaves, as their value in trades during conflict often outweighed their value as workers.

They suffered much injustice during these times, but the [[Off-Human]] slaves faced a much darker fate. The ways the nations had to stretch during wartimes depended heavily on the labor of slaves. The greater the stakes of the battle, the greater the mistreatment of [[Off-Human]] slaves. Many recognize this suffering as the greatest of all during the [[Triumvirate Battles]].

## The Triumvirate Concord
After the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] and the creation of [[Warforged]], the [[Triumvirate Battles]] entered a state of fast moving destruction and exhaustion of resources. The machines were so efficient at warfare they expedited the rate at which the conflict occurred. A sort of mutually assured destruction. This paired with vast numbers of [[Warforged]] going rouge made for very bloody battles.

This forced [[The Triumvirate]] to reconsider their disputes. The world had changed so much and it was evident how little [[Zol]] knew about itself. The kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] struck and agreement to stop the conflict, and release all slaves that were [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].

Political amicability grew over time, but cultural divide never faded. Still to this day there is great disdain between the people of [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]].

Since the concord, no major conflicts between kingdoms has arisen.
