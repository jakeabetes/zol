title: "Attenuation"
---[[Attenuation]] is the process by which an individual is able to use a magical object. This may be [[Apparatum]] or some more powerful [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. Regardless of make, most individuals can only attune with around 3 objects. However some can utilize many more.

Not all [[Magic]] objects require [[Attenuation]] if they are simplistic in their make. Academics do not know why there is a limit to [[Attenuation]], but the working theory is the limit of one's [[Vizir]].
