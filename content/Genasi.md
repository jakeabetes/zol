## Description
Genasi look quite similar to [[Humans]], but bear distinct colored markings that look like tattoos colored either black, red, white, blue, or green. These colors correspond to a [[Genasi]]'s connection to the elements. This connection is formed by a bond with a strange cast of beings called [[Sylfs]]. This bond grants [[Genasi]] with a control of Fire, Water, Earth, or Wind.

When a [[Genasi]] is born, they do not have an element associated with them. In this state they are known as Halcyon Genasi and bear no powers, leaving their patterns on their skin an inert black. They only gain an element when they bond with [[Sylfs]]. [[Genasi]] cannot bond more than one Sylf.
