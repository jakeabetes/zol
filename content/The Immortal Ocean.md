Ever present light glows throughout this realm with no present sun. There is seawater as high or low as you go with no surface or bottom. Neutrally buoyant coral reefs drift about in its currents that are home to a menagerie of aquatic life.

Diverse and angelic sea life swim freely amongst this mysterious place. It is thought that this realm is the source of the endless water that fills the [[Prime Material Plane]]'s oceans.
