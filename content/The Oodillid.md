A long, and slimey creature who is rumored to live beneath [[Kierketholl]]. It is said to be reasonably dangerous, and exceptionally hard to kill. Many people claim to have seen it, and their accounts describe it as a long, worm like being made from slime. It seems to have the ability to regenerate its own body at an alarming rate.

Many Mistbreathers of [[Kierketholl]] claim to know someone who was attacked by it.
