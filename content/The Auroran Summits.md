---![[The Auroran Summits.png]]

One of the smaller mountain ranges within The Three Corners, but its size does not detract from its majesty. A sacred set of peaks to [[Audran]] of [[Laenwalde]]. Evidence shows that the veil between [[Zol]] and [[The Ethereal Plane]] is thinner here, allowing the attuned to touch the spiritual, and cognitive world with ease. 

At night, the peaks give of vibrant tendrils of light against the sky called an Aurora. These are thought by scholars to be manifestations of [[The Ethereal Plane]] visible in the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Many mountains give them off, and a lot of [[Zol]]'s more northern regions may sometimes witness them spontaneously in the sky at night. However none shine so brilliantly as those of [[The Auroran Summits]].

## Location
The summits reside within [[Arcadia]] of [[Laenwalde]].
