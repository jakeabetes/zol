title: "Schools of Magic"
---The Schools of [[Magic]] are a set of informational [[energy]] signatures given off by the presence or usage of magic. There is thought to be a theoretical unlimited amount of these, but only 8 are observed with regularity within [[Zol]].
- [[Conjuration]]
- [[Necromancy]]
- [[Evocation]]
- [[Abjuration]]
- [[Transmutation]]
- [[Divination]]
- [[Enchantment (School)]]
- [[Illusion]]

Some magic is far too basic to give off  signature that would indicate a specific school. This is called [[Reduced Magic]].
