---*Wandering God, Moral of Sagacity*
![[Kaszu 2.png]]

There is no gift more powerful, wonderful, and dangerous than foresight. [[Kaszu]], also known as *Father Time* bears the moral of Sagacity. His teachings and followers surround the idea of protecting the sanctity of time itself. The manipulation of Time and Fate is a thing that attracts many Arcanists. This is a threat to the balance of all things, as time is the most volatile force know to [[Sapient Beings]]. [[Kaszu]] teaches the Moral of Sagacity, specifically with respect to Time, Fate, [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]].

## Depiction
Depicted as a man of large scale with dark greying hair. He bears ornate, purple robes and has a third eye on his forehead. His eyes are typically depicted as glowing, but on occasion he is shown as missing his left eye from its socket, and/or missing a finger on his left hand. Some depict him as having more human features while others depict him as being a very large gnome-like being.

## Moral
[[Kaszu]] teaches the moral of Sagacity. The skill of showing good judgment, wisdom, and foresight. This skill is beneficial in all aspects of life, but in the scripture of [[Kaszu]] it specifically focuses on these ideas in terms of tampering with Fate and Time.

[[Magic]] is a very dangerous thing, and it allows for individuals to interface and tamper with both Fate and Time. This tampering can have some of the most grave consequences, and have the capacity to effect much more than just the individual(s) who initiated it.

By the ideals of [[The Wandering Gods]], [[Gods]] cannot limit the actions of mortals unable to resist the will of a God. [[Kaszu]] allows for the usage of [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]], so long as they are done with sagacity and wisdom. Thinking ahead on all things is in the core of making wise decisions.  

## Associations
[[Kaszu]] is associated with:
- Academics
- [[Chronomancy]]
- [[Incana]]
- Fate
- Time

## Realm
Within [[The Unknown Realm]], [[Kaszu]]'s domain is a very tall wizards tower. There is much speculation on what marvels line its halls, as little is written about it in scripture.

## Behavior
[[Kaszu]] is said to present himself like an old gentle teacher to his followers. Giving hints of advice when a learning opportunity arises, or when mistakes are made and the chance for improvement makes its head.

Controversially, there are some stories of [[Kaszu]] acting like a legal judge for those who have done heinous acts, abusing the powers of [[Arcana]] and [[Incana]]. Within a grand judgement room he decides a punishment for these perpetrators. However these are mostly considered to be mere stories. 

## Worshipers
Most who follow [[Kaszu]] do not do so in a reverential way as many religions do. The majority are actually academics who research [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]]. They look to his teachings for guidance and wisdom, as these forces are remarkably dangerous. His followers are know to protect [[Zol]] against the dangers these forces pose, implementing policy and enacting punishment against those who carelessly pursue the manipulation of the past and future.

It is worth noting that only about 3/4's of academics in these specific fields follow the guidance of [[Kaszu]]'s teachings. And less than 1/4 consider themselves to be even light followers of his religion. The rest chase after the powers of Fate and Time on their own moral compass alone.
