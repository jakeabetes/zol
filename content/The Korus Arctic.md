The cold beyond, The Third Corner. To most, [[The Korus Arctic]] is a place that exists within story. Tales of colossal monsters formed of ice, tribes of fearsome yeti, and ice that is so cold it will steal the magic out of even the most powerful of mages. While the tales of its majesty inspire fear and wonder, they are not often far from the truth.

No place within [[The Three Corners]] is said to feel so remote. To even reach the arctic is a task that most could not surmount. The secrets it hold frozen within its ice are still yet to be truly uncovered.

- **The Besstle Crevasses** - A tract of frozen land that has a 'shattered' appearance. It is littered with deep crevasses that are very treacherous to the few who would navigate them. 
- **The Benumbed Snowfields and The Bleak Walls Beyond** - Past all the beauty and strangeness lies a seemingly endless field of snow, only broken up by massive shelves of ice that form walls thousands of feet high, and stretch from east to west. Supposedly these ice shelves are stacked one on top of the other creating impossibly large step-shaped topography. Venturing this far is next to impossible as the cold continues to grow more intense the further north you travel. At a certain point the cold itself begins to suppress magic. It is made even more dangerous by the influence of the wayward god [[Daetro]], who is known to smite those who tread into his domain.

## Climate
The arctic is a tundra that can grow so terrifyingly cold that magic is suppressed, and even extinguished in the far north.

## History and Inhabitants
Few reside within the region due to the harshness of the climate. Those who do must ensure they are very fit for it lest they face lethal consequences. The few pieces of society that exist are monastic temples that seek disconnection from the material world of [[The Three Corners]].

There also exists a society of native Yetis in the far north. These yeti are not to be trifled with, but are apparently quite reasonable and can even be traded with.

Many scholars seek the rumored relics and ruins frozen within the ice. Some also hope to unlock the secrets to the magical suppression of the cold.
