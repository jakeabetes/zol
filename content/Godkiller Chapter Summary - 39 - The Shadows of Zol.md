title: "Godkiller Chapter Summary - 39 - The Shadows of Zol"
---
- **Chapter begins on a dreary night on the 50th of Spring, Fae'n, Annum 4466**
- In the deep dancing shadows and pouring rain, our heroes were cornered at the end of their long journey. [[Holocene]] mere miles away.
- Palce, Silk, and anyone who wasn't dead yet slid along with you into the muddy gully where massive shadowy creatures, demons, bore down upon you. Summoned by an individual clad in dark magic.
- Something had come to ensure none of you made it to the [[Chalkstone]] city. And it had brought horrors from [[The Void]] to see its will done.
- Differences  with Palce's crew were set aside and our heroes dug in.
- Shadowy razor sharp claws, and hurled balls of black fire tore bandits to shreds and forced The Street Dogs into a corner.
- Magnus found himself seized by the summoning being, who revealed herself to be none other than Lady Kalimae Sky.
- Her known associations with mysterious entity's like Gideon Gain lent Magnus a modicum understanding, but he was ultimately confused at her appearance. Why and how the noblewoman had come to conduct mass killing was foremost amongst the groups questions. Unfortunately all she'd supply was the fact that she'd been sent to "recover" the situation. Magnus getting the impression that she was being tested somehow.
- Kalimae had a collection of concerns. The Street Dogs survival, the shadow looming in the sky, and most of all Curtis' whereabouts. Keen on giving her husband-to-be a less than warm welcome.
- Blood, ever the pest, entered the fray. Firing shots down at our heroes. Lady Sky confronted the warforged. Saying specifically "You're not supposed to be here". A statement that confused the warforged. Kalimae was evidentially a stranger to him. It was almost as if Kalimae saw his presence as a pollutant working against her goals. Her solution was to throw the assassin into the increasingly lethal fray below.
- Markenneth foresaw the possible end, and told Mal he had a plan. Mal, trusting as he was at this point fell for Markenneth's trap.
- The mage paralyzed Mal, stole his prosthetic arm, and forced him to wear the same appearance-altering ring they'd previously used to disguise Magnus as a bear.
- However this time it made Mal look like Curtis. Blood fell for this disguise but Lady Sky was not so easily fooled. Taking flight after Markenneth who'd gotten away with the young lord.
- Bodies continued to pile as the gully filled with water. Only Palce, Silk, and one of their determined elites staying strong.
- Against the odds, the group managed to slay the demons. Leaving only Blood to deal with.
- Blood went into a desperate rage. Speaking almost incoherently to Sherman as he displayed something within his core. A mechanism of concentric triangles bearing the ferroillumic symbols for attack, defense, and order at its vertices.
- Sherman nearly died to the warforged, but The Street dogs prevailed. Killing the obsessive assassin and taking his head.
- Palce, Silk and their friend made for the trees once they realized the real Curtis was nowhere to be seen, and our heroes went after Markenneth and Curtis.
- It was the mages screams they heard first. They found him on his knees in a clearing. Curtis nowhere to be found. Lady Sky had been using her powers to torture him for information on Curtis location.
- However, she knew it was already too late. Curtis would make it to [[Holocene]] after all.
- Lady Sky executed Markenneth and allowed Mal to search the body. Retrieving his arm, stealing Markenneth's journal and his spell book.
- She apologized to them for all the mayhem. Telling them to give up on Curtis. He **will** be killed, and they cannot stop it. 
- However, Lady Sky's people seemed to think killing him outside the city was paramount, as now something called the law of Familial Death would come into play if were to be killed in Holocene. Triggering an investigation that would spark large scale chaos.
- Keen minds amongst the group realized the pattern of Kalimae's behavior and powers. Haith had been the inheritor of fire, it was likely that Kalimae's command over shadow came from a similar place. Chrysalis may grant her some powers, but what she exhibited in the gully was beyond what they'd even seen from Haith.
- Mal, unable to help himself, delved into Lady Skye's mind. Finding the determined woman to be furious at herself, frustrated with her circumstance, but glad the party made it through. Not just because she is fond of them (Magnus especially), but for a deeper reason.
- For some purpose, Curtis' death was important. Necessary. Mal couldn't see why but he got the impression that The Street Dogs survival held an even greater value that the arrogant noble's assassination.
