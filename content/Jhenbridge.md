Located within [[Audran]], the school is an integral part of [[The University]]. [[Jhenbridge]] is an institution of the [[Arcanum]], and is famed for its accessible education. [[Jhenbridge]] is built atop the ruins of Keptifer Academy. Keptifer was a small, and private academic institution from before [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked the city, and reduced the school to rubble. It was not a very long standing school, and most saw it as a place for dangerous mages to interact out of the public's eyes. The loss of Keptifer Academy was a tragic thing for those in academic circles, however the deep bowels of Keptifer were largely left untouched. Clever academics built [[Jhenbridge]] atop these hidden treasures to protect and claim the mysterious resources deep under the city.

The school is largely comprised of beautiful stone buildings with large windows. Its campus covers a large portion of the inner city district of Charside, and it has many buildings, public squares, and gardens. Some of the buildings still bear the scars of [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack.

Those who wish to learn here are allowed to do so for free in their first year. If they are successful, they may pursue a further education. Cost of tuition is based on a students promise. The better they can serve their school, the less expensive their fees. First year courses are also very low level, and they do not include the great dangers of magic. Based on this, much of the public sees the school as a pillar of the community, however skeptics think that they keep a horrible secret below the school. Students and staff have a great love for the campus. Since it is very accessible, there is a diverse group of economic classes who attend [[Jhenbridge]].

## Admission
Joining the school is quite simple. All that is required is a detailed entrance interview to determine if an individual is fit for academia. Over 90% of individuals are admitted. Upon admission, an individual can choose to take lodging and a meal token which. Both of which are very humble things. A small dorm (which is sometimes just a single bunk, small desk, and chest), as well as 2 meals per day at the dining hall which most students call *"Bricks"*. Many students who have the means choose to live and eat elsewhere.

After their first year, students can apply for further education. If accepted, they will be told a billing fee based on their promise as an academic. Those who are more skilled receive lower tuitions. It is also an unofficial rule, that those of lesser means typically receive lower costs than nobles who the school can bleed for money. If a student is rejected, they can apply again for readmission the following year for a fee. They are tested by verbal examination, and if they do well they are given a tuition cost, otherwise they must try again next year.

[[Jhenbridge]] is often mocked for the fact it has the lowest tuition costs to an academic institution which studies [[Arcana]]. However its education is just as valid as any other.

## Leadership
The school is headed by The Broken Table. A council of esteemed Arcanists who have served the school for many years. There is no sole leader, but only ever 5 members to avoid ties in voting. They conduct their meetings at The Broken Table. A large stone table that was cracked during the attack on [[Audran]] by [[The Castle of Bodies]].

## Members

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| First Years | Students who are in their first, free year of education. A little under a tenth of these students will go on to higher education. Because of this, these students are largely mocked. |
| Irons | Students who have passed their first year of education, or readmission exam, and have continued on. These students receive an iron pinky-ring to mark their status. |
| Silvers | Students who have spent a few terms in Iron, and have proven themselves adept at [[Magic]]. These students receive a silver pinky-ring to mark their status. |
| Golds | Students who have become [[Speakers]], or otherwise proved themselves extremely adept at [[Magic]]. These are few in number, and of the highest skill amongst students. These students receive a gold pinky-ring to mark their status. |
| Arcanists | Those welcomed fully into the rank of master. These are individuals who have become the peers of their teachers, or even surpassed them. Some remain at the school to teach or study, others venture out into the world. They are given a ring of [[Mythril]], and sometimes the rings are set with various stones. It is not known publicly what the specific stones denote, but students claim that they show the unique successes of a given individual. |
| Students | Those who receive an education. |
| Professors | Those who wear bands of [[Mythril]], and teach students. |
| Instructors | Promising students who wear bands of gold, and aid in the teaching of lower students. |

## Other information
- The more prestigious sister school of [[The Brass Hall]] will occasionally head hunt more promising students from [[Jhenbridge]]. Because of this, there is a rivalry amongst the staff of both schools.
- Very rarely a student or professor will transfer to [[Jhenbridge]]. In this case there is no examination given, and the offer to join the school usually comes with a ring.
