title: "Godkiller Chapter Summary - 52 - Justice for Holocene"
---

  - **Chapter begins in the dark, early morning of the 55th of Spring, Annum 4466**
  - Lord VanVeld proposed a deal to our heroes. If they threw themselves at the draconic threat once more, he would reward them yet again.
  - However, The Street Dogs would probably have gone anyways. Magnus was dead set on confronting the wounded dragon.
  - And confront he did. In the smoldering streets of Holocene, Magnus stood before Hethrogon the Golden. Making a case for the city's salvation.
  - Hethrogon lent his ear to Magnus, but would not accept the pleas of a lesser being. This day had been "promised" to the dragon, and it would serve vengeance on behalf of Ikgoras. The being who long ago became the dragonbane our heroes had successfully destroyed.
  - Hethrogon deduced something unique about Magnus. A sixth sense shared amongst dragon kind saw through the surface of the goliath's powers. Magnus was apparently no storm blessed.
  - The ancient dragon granted Magnus one mercy. That this would all be over soon. The golden god-like creature spared the party and rushed The Pale Ward with aims to destroy the palace.
  - It was time for plan "b". The group broke off in two. Most giving everything they have left to draw Hethrogon's attention while Magnus sprinted for a well of power held in the city's defenses. A "storm drain". A rod of [[Mythril]] charged over centuries by the ambient power of the [[Greatwinds]]
  - Magnus pushed his body until breaking as his friends pestered the dragon. Buying mere moments of safety for the palace.
  - Even with all his power, all his might, Magnus was taking too long. In a last ditch effort, he put all the magic he had not into his muscles but into Viz. A vision from the perspective of Viz flashed in his mind. Magnus' body dead at the feet of [[Adrathar]]. Something in the little dragon *changed*.
  - More than half The Street Dogs were buried beneath rubble. Hethrogon mere seconds from finishing them all. They braced for the end, but their would-be final thoughts were interrupted by the sound of beating footfalls and claws against cobbles.
  - Magnus, riding more than half dead on the back of Viz who now stood taller than a horse, came tearing through the smoke. Wielding the glowing power-source like a lance.
  - In his final moments of consciousness, he drove the object into Hethrogon's wounds.
  - As the sun broke the horizon, wicked and orange through the smoke. Mal used the literal last of his arcane reserve. Igniting the power held within the object.
  - **Chapter ends on the sunrise of the 55th of Spring, Annum 4466**
