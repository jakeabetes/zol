title: "The Before"

The lost ages of [[Zol]]. An epoch of unknown duration that occurred between the [[Origin]] and [[The Awakening]]. The age came to an end on the advent of [[The Undoing]].

Due to the effects of [[The Undoing]], there is no memory, an minimal writing that survived the destruction. The landscape that was home to the ancient people of [[Zol]] was struck with a force so destructive it demolished nearly everything, reducing it to dust and ruins. What was left was a seemingly endless wasteland.

Parts of ruined towns and other elements of civilization have been discovered. Murals, magical relics, scraps of paper, bones, tapestries, pottery, metal and glassworks, and ruined machines tell of an ancient people far more advanced than modern people. These ruins are strangely not obliterated like many would expect. The exact nature of [[The Undoing]]'s destruction was not akin to an explosion, but more like an unraveling of the past.

It is thought this civilization had a comprehensive understanding of [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]], and they lived centuries long lifespans. Only evidence of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] in the old world have been uncovered. 

Due to this evidence, paired with the fact that [[Humans]] are much shorter lived than [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]], many theories about [[Old Zol]] were created. Most notably, many believe in [[Great Magic]] belonging to [[The Triumvirate]].
