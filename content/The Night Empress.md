Known for their mystery and matronly nature, [[The Night Empress]] is the cryptic mother who sits amongst the [[Zolaen Gods]]. She has dominion over the strange world night creates, and those who pass through it.

## Depiction
Depicted as a [[Drow]]-like woman of purple, dark-grey, or blue skin with long flowing hair. She is usually typically drawn clothing, and the edges of her being do not appear well defined, almost vapor-like at her boundary. She appears as if she is super-imposed against the shadows of night.

Sometimes her presence is subtle, like a shifting shadow. Other times she is known to occupy the whole of the night sky.

## Symbolism
Her symbol is a crescent moon, and vertically oriented eye that is fit into one-another to form a full circle.

## Behavior
Known to be unpredictable in the eyes of mortals. Sometimes she is kind and caring to the world, other times she may be stern or even wrathful. While difficult to understand, her intentions are thought to be with some great unknown purpose.

Communication with her followers is known to be cryptic and poetic, with many different possible meanings. She has a reputation of sending her followers on strange pilgrimages to see her will done.

## Realm
Occupying [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a strange and lost divine plane to [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]]. Very little is known about this realm.

## Worshipers
Worship of [[The Night Empress]] is known to be practiced with a high degree of formal prayer when done amongst the population of cities, but in private it is know to be obscure and involve chanting, dancing, and live animal sacrifice.
