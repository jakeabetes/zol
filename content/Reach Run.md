---*The Vibrant City of [[Aarakocra]]*
![[Reach Run skyline.png]]

Above the costal city of [[Reach Run]], a sky filled with airships, hot air balloons, and flying [[Aarakocra]]. The city is a hub of all things aeronautical. One might assume that a city of flying businesses and citizens would be inaccessible or unwelcoming to those less aerially inclined, however the opposite is in fact the truth. [[Aarakocra]] are know for being some of the most welcoming, fun loving folk in all of [[Zol]]. Their influence has shaped the city into a hospitable place where even grumpy, terrestrial [[Dwarves]] can feel the thrill of flying.

| Main Opportunity         | The city is a trade hub, located centrally within The Three Corners of Civilization. People and imported goods flow through the city like water. It is a welcoming city of opportunity. Its flying infrastructure, fun loving citizens, fast moving culture, and abundant trade have an intoxicating grasp on many travelers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Main Challenge           | Things move in and out of the city at such a fast rate, it can sometimes bring problems. Contraband, shady individuals, and criminals on the run can easily slip in and out of the city. When bumping into this side of [[Reach Run]], one should keep their eyes down and move on if they don't want trouble. Since the city attracts nearly everyone on the road, good or bad, the unfortunate meetings that many have with things like criminals sometimes extend to personal encounters as well. There seems to almost be some magical influence on the city that causes people to bump into individuals they know, often it is friends, but sometimes it is foes. |

| Cabbies       | Misc.        | A name for a local, unique profession. Since the city is vertically distributed, those who do not have a means of flight require some service to move about the complex city. Cabbies graciously fill this role by carrying people or parcels to their destination. Typically, cabbies will lift a large wicker carriage, called a *cab*, capable of moving one or more people to their desired location. A strong cabbie can move one or two individuals on their own given they are of modest weight, or sometimes they work in teams to move heavier loads. Most cabbies are [[Aarakocra]], but the role can be filled by anyone who can fly. Be it by natural, magical, or mechanical means. Cabbies are known to posses a vast knowledge about the city, and current gossip. They have a reputation of being quick-tongued, and very friendly. Their services are not expensive, but it pays in other ways to tip cabbies well |

## Authority
The city is overlooked by High Lord Gerrian Gaalokria IV. A proud Aarakocran Noble of long standing lineage. House Gaalokria has been in the seat of leadership within [[Reach Run]] for many generations. For a long time, the city has always been a little on the chaotic side. However since High Lord Gerrian Gaalokria IV has taken the throne, the disorderly nature of the city has nearly doubled.

High Lord Gerrian Gaalokria IV is not loved by his citizens. He is infamous for allowing the city to proceed in a disorderly manner. His rule is often summed up with one of his quotes: *"Ruling Reach Run is like plumbing a house. Some pipes are for clean water, some are for shit. In a perfect world we wouldn't need the latter; hell we wouldn't even need the first. This isn't a perfect world, we need both pipes, and you have to let them flow in their own way or they get clogged."*

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In the current day and age, the city is the hub for aeronautical craft, repair and trade. It is not the only city within [[Zol]] that conducts this business, but it is by far the one who does it the best.

## Historical Importance
During much of the [[Triumvirate Battles]], sailors lost at sea would frequently drift into the waters near [[Reach Run]] and seek refuge within the city. Strange friends and enemies were made between Dwarf, Elf, and Human during this period.

## Other Things of Note
- Within [[Reach Run]] there is a very popular and unique sport called [[Flaunt]].
- The people of [[Reach Run]] steer clear of [[The East Mounts]], buying in on the folktales and rumors of a cursed mountain range
