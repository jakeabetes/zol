title: "Outer Villages"
---
An outer village is a small satellite community that is under the jurisdiction of a nearby city. Their population is typically a few hundred people, and rarely exceeds two thousand. Some are even less than one hundred people strong. These are usually farming communities and they depend on the city for its trade and other infrastructure. 

They are similar to [[Gate Town]]s in terms of economic status and level of education. The members of these communities are typically seen as the peasants, serfs or other sorts of lowly commoners all about [[Zol]]. Both types of outer-city communities are usually the first to feel the wrath of warfare when it finds a city. Additionally, since there is no physical barrier stopping bandits and monsters from entering, these communities often find themselves at the mercy of these dangers.

Another related concept is [[Estates]] which are walled properties of land outside of the city, usually owned by the rich. These differ from [[Gate Towns]] and [[Outer Villages]] due to the fact they have many more defenses.
