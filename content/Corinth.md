title: "Corinth"
---*The Unmarred Changeling City, home to one of [[The Oldshards]]*
![[Corinth Skyline.png]]

A towering city of sleek black stone, and sharply accented structures. Home to [[Changelings]] and their remaining Old Shard. The city is the last standing bastion of a culture alien to the rest of [[Zol]]. This culture, based around [[The Oldshards]], is so old that it may even predate [[The Undoing]]. In this far north city of order and tradition, scholars and philosophers study [[The Vertex]] in hopes to better understand [[Changelings]] and the world they live in.

## Overview

| Aspect | Description |
|-|-|
| Main Opportunity | The city is a preserved bastion of Changelings and their unique culture revolving around [[The Vertex]], a perplexing object that seems to break the rules of [[Magic]] and posses a will of its own. [[The Vertex]] grants protection, power and wisdom to those it favors. This culture is built around the [[The Pattern]], a social contract that all changelings are expected to follow. The influence of [[The Pattern]] is a society of extreme order and fairness. Every person is given an education, and local leaders are elected through fair process. |
| Main Challenge | The city is very organized. *Too* organized. Maintaining this level of order requires many laws, processes and policies. There are rules that control things like the exact number of alcoholic beverages one can drink on a given day, the amount of arrows one can carry, how much armor a person can wear, how long one is allowed to stay after eating dinner at a friends home, or even if one is allowed to carry an umbrella during rainfall. This level of control is managed through policing, political debates, bureaucratic process, public forums and things of the like. While providing a high degree of order, it is a very cumbersome way of life.  |

| Shardwitnesses            | Religious/Political Station | Those elected to lead the city, and bear witness to the guidance of [[The Vertex]]. This group is the most respected range of citizens, but they live highly regulated lives by the rules of [[The Pattern]]. At their head sits the city's Shardcaller, Osieur Xetac. Shardwitnesses are similar in their influence to foreign nobility, but lead very strict and humble lifestyles. Those who become Shardwitnesses must be nominated many people (peers, mentors, and authorities) and also prove themselves by means of written essay, and engagement in political and philosophical debate.                                                                 |
| The Public                | General populace            | The people of the city are well cared for. The systems established by [[The Pattern]] have created much infrastructure for [[Changelings]] of all kinds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Members of [[The Eelynn]] | Academic Station            | Scholars and philosophers tasked with teaching and understanding the world. Specifically through the lens of [[The Oldshards]]. Members of this school pursue careers in magic, scholarship, and teaching. All people of the city from ages 8-15 participate in learning at [[The Eelynn]]. The school provides many levels of education, and is a repository of some of [[Zol]]'s most obscure knowledge due to its influences, and removal from the rest of the world. Some members of [[The Eelynn]] are rumored to be tasked with making long pilgrimages to distant lands, bearing changeling disguise, to return with knowledge not yet possessed by [[The Eelynn]]. The highest ranking members of [[The Eelynn]] are all Shardwitnesses.|
| Tarsects                  | Local authority             | A branch of local guard who are tasked with policing the very minute details of the [[Glassian Laws]]. They are not allowed to make arrests, but they are responsible for reporting infractions and doling out fines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Outsiders                 | Racial Group                | The few non-changeling members of society. In the whole city there are less than 30, and each of them has special permission to live within the city. Typically it is for some service they can provide to [[Corinth]]. Their social lives are very delicate things as [[Changelings]] are not trusting of outsiders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep Vertex        | Keep                 | The city's main keep, and holding place of [[The Vertex]]             |
| Vertex Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle. Located within the keep.        |

| Palse Zezac        | Tavern               | A drinking establishment frequented by the local population           |
| [[The Eelynn]]     | College              | A place of study for all [[Changelings]] of the city. Every citizen of [[Corinth]] studies here for at least some part of their youth, and some even go further to become full fledged members. These members go on to study magic, philosophy, and various other branches of academia. All of this study is viewed through the lens of [[The Oldshards]], and the world's relationship to the relics.                                                                      |

## Authority
The city is ruled by Shardcaller Osieur Xetac, an extremely well respected leader of advanced age. Osieur is a very wise ruler and has maintained the order of [[Corinth]] for many years. The Shardcaller of [[Corinth]] has a formidable army at their command, and has secured the region well in the years after the [[Western War]].

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Glassian Laws]].

## Modern Importance
In modern day, the city is viewed by foreigners as a city of evil and deception. There is no race that faces more stigma than [[Changelings]]. Many outsiders believe them to be deceptive monsters who will wear the faces of your friends, steal your gold, and eat your young. In reality, this is a result of propaganda and fear of the unknown. While Changeling society is much different from many foreign cities, they are not evil by nature.

Since [[Yorn et Gaul]] was gravely damaged in the [[Western War]], [[Corinth]] is seen as the last true Changeling city. It is also the only place that possesses one of [[The Oldshards]].

## Historical Importance
In the past, [[Corinth]] sat comfortably separated from the rest of [[Zol]]. The city's existence was known by the outer kingdoms, but they kept their distance. This peaceful privacy only lasted until evidence of changeling spies interfering with the western kingdoms of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] was discovered. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims of interference, but the chain of events led to the [[Western War]].

The war never fully reached [[Corinth]], and only its sister city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] was damaged.

## Other Things of Note
- Most outsiders that come to the city are merchants from [[The Ward]] who make long treks to reach [[The Glassius Reach]]. These traders have respectful relationships with [[Changelings]] and are allowed to come and go from the city.
- The city does utilize [[Apparatum]], however its disconnection from the outside world has made it difficult for [[The Glassius Reach]] to keep up with the advancements in technique and skills involved in the [[Artificers]] practice.
