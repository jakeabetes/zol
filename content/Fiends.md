title: "Fiends"
---[[Fiends]], sometimes called Devils, are the acolytes of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. There are an evil cast of heinous creatures. They are either the descendants of, or the very beings who were created long ago to destroy [[Goh'zul]]. 

Long before The [[Sea of Monsters]] even existed. [[Goh'zul]] was a being who had the power to create worlds, grow them, and devour them to satiate his endless hunger. Many of the worlds he made were aware of his existence, and tried to stop their destruction. A strange, repeating phenomenon occurred in many of these realms. Legions of [[Fiends]] were made by the gods of these long dead worlds in a futile attempt to strike back at [[Goh'zul]]. They would be given a realm of their own, called a *Hell*. It is not know why this phenomenon happened so regularly. Perhaps it was part of [[Goh'zul]]'s design, or perhaps it was just convergent evolution of these worlds.

As a method of payment, the gods would often send the souls of sinners to the fiends as payment. It is not known why this transaction was made, but many assume it was for sustenance or to entertain them. Regardless, the exchange largely kept them at bay.

Despite the efforts of these worlds, it was never enough to defeat him. When he would consume them, he would leave the hells undigested (for lack of a better term). They sat trapped in his body for eons. Eventually, they began colliding and merging. When they all formed into one singular, colossal realm, a massive war amongst them eventually left [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] as their ruler.

Not all [[Fiends]] are evil, supposedly some of them in [[Apolyatum]] are quite reasonable and person-like. However the vast majority are nefarious and horrifying. Their once mission to destroy [[Goh'zul]], and their hatred towards him for trapping them in his body like a prison has only fortified their original mission to destroy him. However, since he is dead that hate is instead aimed at the world of [[Zol]].

[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.
