Curiosities are afflictions caused by the influence of magic. They cannot be cured by standard medicine or simplistic application of curative magic. Curiosities either have no cure, or are extremely hard to cure. Their symptoms may have very strange effects which push biology and being in odd directions.

Examples of some curiosities are:
- [[Materiation]]
- The [[Beast Ire]] Plague
- [[Alchemist's Blood]]
