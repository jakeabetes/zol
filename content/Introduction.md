# Introduction
In its [[Origin]], [[Zol]] was spun from the [[Sea of Monsters]] in words spoken by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Zol is never without strife, beauty, hardship, innovation, danger, majesty, mystery, and adventure.

A world thought to have once been ruled by Elves, Dwarves and Humans. These races, known as [[The Triumvirate]] used the power of [[The Trinity]] to create an advanced and prosperous society. Sprawling cities of life, art and culture once graced Zol. This was all lost in [[The Undoing]].

Not much is known about the time before [[The Undoing]], or what caused it. Ancient texts tell stories of a heinous act made by the humans. It is thought to have been a scheme that would turn humanity so far from the light, the [[Gods]] punished all of Zol for the crime. Others believe it was caused by [[The Wandering Gods]], the divine alien force that made themselves known to mortals a century after [[The Undoing]].

Since it is not known which gods or forces in [[Zol]] enacted [[The Undoing]], many theories try to explain the event, or cast blame on specific gods. Said blame has caused a history's worth of debate, discrimination, and even war.

Regardless of which force caused it. [[The Undoing]] obliterated uncountable tracts of land, reducing them to dust, creating [[The Grand Nothing]]. All beings were banished to the furthest intact corners of Zol, forcing them to begin anew with no knowledge of the old world. The [[Gods]] refuse any question asked to them regarding the event.

Some believe the final punishment of the humans was to have their [[Great Magic]] stripped from them, and fractured. From this revoked magic, the gods created a cast of new races to bear the burden of humanity's sin. These would known as the [[Off-Human]] Races.

In their new home, the sapient world began to atone, rebuild, relearn what was lost. Ages passed for Zol. What was once a nation of refugees now resembled a society, but with only a fraction of its former glory. In these times, only the strong and powerful had true agency, as the [[Untamed Wilds of Zol]] were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out. This all changed when the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.

The powerful mage [[Mordenkainen]] devised a way for the common folk to capture and utilize the magic of [[The Trinity]]. Complex diagrams and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs allowed for simple magical devices that changed Zol forever.

Communication devices, agricultural advances, medical wonders, and many other wonderful things were created using [[Iron Light]]. Most notably, [[The Great Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and once unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were given the agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since [[The Undoing]].

Now Zol sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity. A realm formed from the corpse of an infinite being. A developing world wrought with natural mystery, lost history, and unclaimed power. A world where anyone can claim their own destiny.
