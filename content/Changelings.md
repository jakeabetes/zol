## Description
[[Changelings]] are a very unique race of people. This uniqueness has brought them many gifts, but equally as many challenges. [[Changelings]] look similar to stark white elves, with equally white skin and dark eyes. However they are not bound by this appearance. They may choose to adapt their form to any other form of their choosing given it is of similar relative height and mass. This means they can appear as any person they choose allowing them to take perfect disguises. Alternatively they can take a form entirely of their own creation, making their skin look like it was formed of moving crystal, and their hair of spun gold.

An individual changeling has much control over their identity. They can even willingly control their sexual characteristics. Their culture has adapted around this and two forms exist as ones identity:
- Pure Form - The way one looks upon birth, the characteristic white hair and skin of [[Changelings]]. This form is a personal and sacred thing
- True Form - A form that exists as an expression of self. It is designed by [[Changelings]] in their youth and is the form [[Changelings]] express for the majority of their lives. A True Form does not look like a typical body. An individual may make themselves look as if their skin was made of carved and stained wood, painted porcelain, and anything one can feasibly imagine.

[[Changelings]] live almost exclusively within their own remote northern kingdom of [[The Glassius Reach]], where they worshiped powerful objects called [[The Oldshards]]. When the outside world learned of their ability to do this, fear an worry filled their minds. People began to fear their neighbors were replaced with [[Changelings]] sent to steal from them, or worse. The mystery and fear surrounding them eventually spiraled into [[Western War]], a war that cost [[The Glassius Reach]] many losses.

This war was so damaging to [[Changelings]], it has politically divided them from the rest of the outside world, save for the occasional merchant relationship with [[The Ward]]. [[Changelings]] would not find themselves welcomed in most cities. Luckily for them they can present themselves in any way they choose.

## Additional Info
- The way [[Changelings]] adapt their form is not an [[Illusion]], but an actual [[Transmutation]] of their bodies. These changes take time to adopt (usually a few minutes), depending on the skill of the changeling
