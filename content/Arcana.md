title: "Arcana"
---# Arcana
[[Arcana]] is the third of the wills. It is [[Magic]] derived from the unbound power left within [[The Trinity]]. It is the most abstract of the wills and is the most difficult to harness. It is harnessed by conceptualizing [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. If one is trained enough the can make these conceptualizations real.

The usage of [[Arcana]] is recognized in 2 ways:
- Academic [[Arcana]]
	- The practice of the arcane arts taught at universities and other guilds. They follow similar curriculum of training, and focus on the cumulative knowledge of the civilized world to acquire their learning.
	- On a grand scale, this is the much more realistic way to use [[Arcana]], but is more challenging
- Non-Academic [[Arcana]]
	- Any usage of the arcane that does not subscribe to Academia. This can be things like:
		- Self-invented practice
		- Ability through a gift
		- Witchcraft
		- Occult Blood Magic
		- Usage of a powerful magical object
		- etc.
	- Most of these do not demand the same level of mental strength as Academic [[Arcana]] as these typically are done with some external aide (Ex: being born with ancestry involving [[Dragons]])
	- This is much more rare than its academic counterpart

There is theoretically an infinite number of ways to use [[Arcana]] in a Non-Academic way, all of which share a lot of commonality with the academic version, but all posses their own unique twist. Based on this, we can summarize the usage of [[Arcana]] by these few concepts:
- [[Sympathetic bonds]]
- [[Splitting]]
- [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]

## Iron Light
A recent development allowed for a new version of academic arcana. The utilization of [[Iron Light]] to create simple magic devices.
