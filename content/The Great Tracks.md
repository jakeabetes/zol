# The Great Tracks
*What unites us*
![[The Great Tracks.png]]
## Construction
The Great Tracks are a wonderous feat of engineering. Designed by the combined efforts of [[The University]], [[Kerketh Academy]] and [[The Kybis Assembly]]. A complex combination of [[Iron Light]] and infrastructure that spans The Three Corners of Civilization. A network of [[Trains]] that allows for anyone, powerful or not, to cross [[Zol]].

Originally conceptualized for the purpose of unifying the people of [[Zol]]. Allowing for common folk to cross the too-dangerous wilds with ease. This vision was met with resistance from the more conservative members of society. However, even they could not deny the immense economical benefits it would create.

The design and production of engines was given to the city of [[Rails]] due to its central location. The cities name becoming the nickname for the tracks the [[Trains]] ran on. Their blueprints coming from [[Artificers]] from [[Kerketh Academy]].

Droves of workers and garrisons had to perform long and drawn out missions to construct railways between cities. Monsters and beasts of the wilds would attack the workers daily. The only reason so many did the labor was the high wages for rail workers and security detail.

## Modern Function
In the current day and age, the [[Trains]] are integral to society. Moving exports and passengers of all types. They move at such high velocity any creature or structure in their path is obliterated.

Running on the power of [[Nodes]] in a state of [[Space]], drawing them in at the nose of the train and converting them into motion. The operation of the complex [[Apparatum]] is performed by a conductor.

There is a monetary cost for using the [[Trains]], either as a passenger or using them for transporting goods. In either case, there is a spectrum of services all at different costs. This allows for even the less fortunate to use [[The Great Tracks]] if they are able to save for it.

The [[Trains]] move hundreds of cars long night and day. In almost all cases the tracks run outside of a cities walls, stopping at a local station. Their incoming is felt as rumbling earth, and a distinct, low hum.

## Notable Exceptions
Some cities, or kingdoms do not use [[The Great Tracks]]. Be it religious beliefs, geographical location, or cultural differences.
- [[The Ward]] does not use [[The Great Tracks]] because of their disallowance of [[Apparatum]] for religious reasons.
- [[The Glassius Reach]] is not included in [[The Great Tracks]] due to political differences and recent war.
- [[Gethsemane]] only has a single train station in [[Mod Dranor]]. This is largely because of Xenophobia.
- [[Heliodor]] has a station nearby located on the ground where individuals can take [[Airships]] to the city.
