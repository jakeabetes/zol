# Gilligan's Lift
*The way to the old world*

Located in [[Tenzentak]], and operated by [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. [[Gilligan's Lift]] is a great feat of engineering that gives passage from the top of the high cliffs that overlook [[The Grand Nothing]], all the way to the bottom. The lift operates over thousands of feet and can support extremely heavy burdens. Remarkably, the lift originally used no [[Magic]] in its operation.

Designed by Odile Gilligan, a gifted Halfling academic woman. Gilligan originally decided to construct the lift only using engineering to spark a movement against [[Zol]]'s over reliance on [[Magic]] wielding individuals. 

## Design
Built as a wide platform suspended by a massive pulley system. Energy for moving the lift is drawn from massive turbines affixed to the wall of the cliff. Powered by the massive gusts of wind that blow vertically up the cliffs face, energy is stored in large springs. A wide platform acts as the lift itself, built of strong metals and wood to resists the same gusts that power it. This makes it capable of moving large quantities of personnel and equipment.

Since the invention of [[Iron Light]], magical improvements have been made for durability, defense, and efficiency. However the core functionality remains non-magic due to its ingenious design. In modern days a one way trip of the lift takes 5 hours. 

## Impact on Society
The lift's operation was given to [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. This is because the guild has a reputation of neutrality on the political scale, making the lift accessible to any who would use it with good intentions.

The cost of operations and profits are managed by the guild, and nobility of [[Tenzentak]]. Security, maintenance, trade deals, tickets, passenger vetting, and staff are all needed to operate the lift.

The lifts creation marked the first accessible method of the common person being able to venture to the grand nothing. Previously it was only performed by those capable of teleportation.
