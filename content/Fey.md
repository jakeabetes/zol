# The Fey
*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Also known as The Fae, Feywilds, or Faer√ªn. The [[Fey]] is an echo of the [[Prime Material Plane]], that manifests almost like a dream-like version of the normal world. It exists under the influence of [[The Mortal Coil]].

It is known for its many wonderous features. The natural landscape is full of strange mountains, magical forests, and other oddities like floating forests of vines in the sky.

While gorgeous, the [[Fey]] is quite dangerous. Filled with odd beasts, monsters and other inhabitants, one would not want to be here unprepared.

The beings who reside in the fey are known for having sharp minds, adept magical abilities, and being quite mischievous.

## Citizens of The Fey
There is one known city within the [[Fey]]. It is known by the name of [[Hymnal]], and is home to a group of [[Elves]] who left the [[Prime Material Plane]] shortly after [[The Undoing]].

These [[Elves]], known as [[Eladrin]] were once [[High Elves]] of the[[Prime Material Plane]]. Thousands of years spend in the [[Fey]] has cause their biology to change significantly.

Those who live in the [[Fey]] are xenophobic, any being who is uninvited to their home is met with significant resistance upon seeking entrance.

Other more reclusive or rare races like [[Fairies]], and [[Saytrs]] also hail from this realm. Some live amongst the city of [[Hymnal]].

## Travel to The Fey
Since the [[Fey]] is an echo of the [[Prime Material Plane]], travel between these planes is much simpler than most other cases. There are even many natural portals to the [[Fey]] that emerge and disappear naturally all over the [[Prime Material Plane]].

If one travels between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the [[Fey]] they would expect to end up in the same spot geographically, but on the other side.
