# Little Triumph
*The worst city*

Built on the utmost edge of [[Kapesh]], surviving against all odds almost as if it were defying the gods themselves. [[Little Triumph]] is a place of little education, constant struggle.

They city was originally an outpost, called Triumph, placed for the purpose of expansion during the lulls of the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. Many of these outposts were constructed on the furthest edges of [[The Witchlands]]. All of these outposts quickly fell to monsters, save for Triumph. Despite regular attacks, disease, and even curses, a small city formed around the outpost.

## Authority
The city is run by Lord Delfin Baron, AKA 'The Baron'. An almost obsessively loyal servant to [[King Galliard]].

Since the city is so remote and largely left alone by the crown, The Baron rules in almost a little bubble of his own. Many other rulers would capitalize on this, but The Baron does not. He seems to have an obsession with [[King Galliard]] and does everything in his name.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].

## Other Things of Note
- It is dangerous to go outside the city, especially at night
- Non humans will face difficulty in the city, some are even turned away
