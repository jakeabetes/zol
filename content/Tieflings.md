## Description
Much stigma and legend revolves around [[Tieflings]]. Said to be of demonic nature, [[Tieflings]] are both feared and adored for their unique manifestation. They are of typically of small to medium build and height, however they do come in all shapes and sizes. All [[Tieflings]] have a set of characteristic horns, but that seems to be the end of their common trait. These horns can appear in many different forms, and sometimes there are even more than one on each side of the head. They can also have wings, tails, claws, unique patterning of the skin, or sharp teeth. Their skin and hair varies greatly in color. Sometimes it is colored like that of the more common [[Races]] (dwarves, humans, elves, halflings, et cetera). Other times it takes on more vibrant colors like blues, reds, yellows, et cetera. This wide range of possible combinations makes for a very diverse species. 

Known to be clever, quick, and mischievous. The origin of their demonic traits is not well known. Those who subscribe to the ideas of [[The Triumvirate]] speak of them as the aspect of humans who once meddled with dark forces. Substantiating this claim is difficult as there is no real evidence of it.
