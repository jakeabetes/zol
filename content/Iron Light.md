# Iron Light
Iron Light is a unique and efficient methodology used to simplify the usage of [[Arcana]] in the application of [[Enchantment]]. Named after the tell tale violet glow the application gives off, [[Iron Light]] was discovered by the great Arcanist and Academic, [[Mordenkainen]]. Its conception was what began the [[Second Age]].

[[Iron Light]] revolutionized [[Zol]] by putting power in the hands of many who would be otherwise be at the whim of the world. Unfortunately, the technique has also introduced new dangers like new weapons of war, and the [[magic]] ailment known as [[Materiation]].

In its most simple form, [[Iron Light]] devices, also known as [[Apparatum]], are created via engraving special runes called the [[Ferric Alphabet]] into plates of Iron. These symbols channel [[Arcana]] similarly to how one uses their [[Vizir]], with the main difference being the user does not need to know the techniques required to harness [[Magic]]. They can achieve the very specific result allowed by the runes by lending their [[Vizir]] to it.

## Examples of Apparatum
Some devices made with [[Iron Light]] are quite simple. Blades that dull very slowly, stoves that heat without fire, lamps that glow without fuel, or even simple refrigeration.

Others are quite complex and powerful. Allowing for things like usage at range, multi-device cooperation, prosthesis, and mathematical estimation. Examples of this are long distance communication devices, flying machines, [[Warforged]], [[Automail]], weather and navigational systems, and even the [[Trains]] of [[The Great Tracks]].

## Production and Economic/Societal Value of Apparatum
The creation of Apparatum is proportional to skill, quality of materials, and complexity of the design. Some designs take hours, while other take days or weeks. Individuals who create [[Apparatum]] are known as [[Artificers]].

As it takes much training to complete even a simple [[Apparatum]], they are costly. Those of the lowest economic status would be lucky to own even a single [[Apparatum]], while those of common wealth will typically own one to three. For nobility, [[Apparatum]] are common place items. Their lavish homes are usually full of devices to increase their general quality of life.

In most civilized cities, there are common [[Apparatum]] that exist for use in business, or pubic benefit. These may be lamps that light the streets at night, or things like the [[Rift Smog]] filters in [[Tenzentak]]. Some civilizations have very particular views on [[Iron Light]]. The people of [[The Ward]] outlaw the usage of [[Apparatum]] based in spiritual belief.

## Advancements in Iron Light
Iron light was originally limited to a small set of [[Ferric Alphabet]] runes, and slow production via iron engraving. Soon after the name was widely adopted, more symbols and compatible materials, and techniques were discovered.

The mediums to support Iron light spread to carpentry, glass working, alchemy, leathercraft, weaving, painting, smiting, and various other crafts. Each with their own pros and cons. The name, which references the purple light the runes emanate when active had already stuck. Fortunately, all techniques require some iron to be present to work. Be it metal inlay, infused materials, or special tools used in creation.

A very popular and reliable technique was discovered for short term Iron Light solutions. A special material called [[Chalkstone]] was found to be very compatible with iron and allows for quick, and relatively accurate creation of [[Apparatum]] that last a small number of months. This is commonly used in novice work, prototyping, mass production, and education. Unfortunately devices made with chalkstone are easily destroyed by water damage.

## Discovery
The Arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] at the end of the [[First Age]]. He observed common patterns in the damage created by [[Magical Backfire]]. By intentionally increasing the damage of [[Magical Backfire]], he was able to spot runes amongst the damage.

One of these runes was found to appear elsewhere. In [[Necromancy]], a phenomenon called a [[Death Scar]] matched exactly to [[Mordenkainen]]'s findings. This led to many other successive discoveries of similar nature. These found runes would later be called the [[Ferric Alphabet]].

After much experimentation with the runes, their interaction with iron was discovered. A decade of experimentation led to a single working lamp, and a basic theory of [[Iron Light]].

Little is known about why [[Iron Light]] actually works. It is widely accepted that there lies something within the properties of iron that mimics a living body, allowing it to share the powers of one's [[Vizir]].

The [[Ferric Alphabet]] is assumed to be some product of [[The First Tongue]]. Since there is very little known about the origin of both subjects, the practice largely operates on assumption in this area.

## The Ferric Alphabet
The [[Ferric Alphabet]] is a wide set of runes that represent the aspect of [[Zol]] like [[Space, Matter, and Energy]] as well as the complex relationships between them. These runes are organized in an infinite amount of configurations to accomplish [[Enchantment]].

The alphabet is thought to be incomplete, and many academics spend their lives searching for more runes. Missing runes are symbolized by the combination of known runes, this is referred to as [[Imperfect Representation]]. For example, glass is represented with light and stone, along with a complex nexus of supporting runes to ensure the combination is successful.

## Negatives to Iron Light
[[Iron Light]] is revolutionary due to how accessible it makes [[magic]], but it is not nearly as powerful as [[Enchantment]] made from [[Grand Forces]].

[[Iron Light]] also demands the usage of one's [[Vizir]], and in turn can be very exhausting if overused. Long term usage of complex [[Apparatum]] causes a rare magical disease called [[Materiation]]. This is only seen when the Apparatum in question requires an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. 

[[Materiation]] causes the afflicted's body to slowly change to a different material state. It is most often seen amongst [[artificers]] and those who operate complex [[Apparatum]] as a part of their career.

This could manifest as holes in the body that slowly pour out smoke, appendages that become plantlike, or famously like the conductors of [[The Great Tracks]] who turn to iron. Though gruesome, the condition is painless and described by the victims as euphoric.

## Iron Light in relation to Grand Forces
[[Iron Light]] [[Enchantment]] is limited due to the fact it depends on the Vizir of an individual. Its more powerful counterpart, [[Grand Forces]], are not limited in this way. Objects of this nature are much more rare and powerful.
