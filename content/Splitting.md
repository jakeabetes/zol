title: "Splitting"
---# Splitting
The act of subdividing ones mind to effectively create multiple minds in one. This grants a [[Caster]] the ability to achieve multiple [[Sympathetic bonds]] at one time. These bonds can accomplish multiple separate tasks, or focus on the same task to amplify the effect.

- Understanding this concept initially is extremely difficult, let alone learning it. To acquire this ability from the ground up, one must initially form the neural pathways to do so. This is done by very particular cognitive exercises such as:
	- Convincing ones self that a dropped object with fall upwards, then downwards, then to not fall at all. Then trying to convince ones self that combinations of these will happen simultaneously.
	- Sitting inside a warm room at a window with cold weather outside. Then convincing yourself you can feel the cold air, and that the exterior is heating.
	- Imaging that an unlit candle is emitting light in a dark familiar room, whilst trying to make the room itself fade from memory.
	- And other strange things of this nature
After some time this practice will go from exhausting to second nature. At the point of this transition. One may begin to observe small, actual changes in their environment. At this point, practitioners can try to make small uses of [[sympathy]] like moving light similar objects, or lighting one candle with another at range.
