The threshold between the [[Greatwinds]], and the cities of Three Corners who could not weather the storms. [[Stormwall]] is a naturally occurring barrier that cuts [[The Ward]] of almost entirely from the rest of [[Zol]]. Its wall-like formation stops the devastating winds of the region from making it to [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. Its existence is seen as a gift from the [[Gods]] by many, and is sacred to various different cultures. 

However during the later ends of [[The Dragon War]], the dragons had to flee their losing battles and consolidated themselves within the region. Making [[Stormwall]] the location with the highest concentration of [[Dragons]] in all of [[The Three Corners]].
