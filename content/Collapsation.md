# Collapsation
[[Collapsation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is an uncommon school. It is magic that involves the manipulation of [[Space]]. This manipulation allows a user to increase or decrease the space in a given area.

This magic is difficult to perform purely based on the sheer amount of focus it requires. It is done by moving the space from one location to another. It can be used to make a room much larger or smaller. Alternatively it can be used to move a target closer or further away from something.

Environments changed by this influence are known to adapt intuitively to the changes in space. A room made smaller will have furniture, shrink, restyle or disappear to accommodate. A forest expanded will have plants emerge from the ground instantly in the newly opened expanse.

These changes however are temporary, and revert back after a few hours. Anything gained in the change disappears, anything lost reappears.

[[Collapsation]] cannot be used to make living things, or magical objects disappear due to interference. If a manipulated space cannot accommodate these things the manipulation will stop at the closest possible point.
