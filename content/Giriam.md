![[Giriam.png]]

Once seen as the caretaker of mortals. Giriam was the kindest of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Giriam had domain over the cultivation of crops and livestock, as well as fertility. His focus was the quality of life for mortal beings.

## Depiction
Depicted as a towering being draped in beautifully patterned multicolored cloth. In some literature regarding fertility, he was depicted as a beautiful man or woman dressed in clothes that echo his towering form. There was however, no formal record of this.

## Symbolism
Cupped hands holding a leaf.

## Behavior
Known to have provided his lifegiving influence to regions that were suffering. Giriam's influence was key for the creation of the modern world of [[Zol]].

## Realm
Residing in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], Giriam tended to the fields that surround its golden palace. These fields do not exist as a means of survival for the palace, but rather a massive sprawling garden.

## Worshipers
Almost anywhere there is civilization there is/was worship of Giriam. It varies vastly from prayer over meals to grand temples built in his honor. Giriam asked nothing of his followers, but teaches them how to do good in the world.

His followers seek to give what they have to sustain a community, echoing the behavior of their god.

**Since the death of the god, many have ceased their worship. However, some cling fanatically to their religion. A significant portion of people still believe that Giriam lives.**

## Ahamatath (The Death of Giriam)
Ahamatath, sometimes called The Ahamatath, is the name for the supposed death of [[Giriam]]. It was not at first known by the public that a god had supposedly died, but the effects of his death were immediate and catastrophic. Growth rates all across [[Zol]] varied with great severity. Some places were struck with devastating famine. However others faced unforeseen abundance, causing harvests so bountiful that fruit rotted on the vines, leading to plagues of pests as farmers could not keep up.

Birth rates also faced extreme change. In some places, birth rates plummeted, while others feared overpopulation.

The public only became aware when other [[Gods]] began to speak of the event. Most denied the events validity, and many still do to this day. However the effects were so widespread that over time, most have come to realize that something significant has effected the domains of agriculture and fertility.

The initial effects of Giriam's death started to trend towards normalcy 6 years after the gods supposed death. However the secondary effects like societal and theological panic still remains. No one knows how or why a god was killed, and what it means for [[Zol]].
