---# The Elemental Planes
*A unique group of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Academics are unsure of exactly what forces form the [[Prime Material Plane]], but many theorize it was constructed by overlapping 4 basic elemental [[Planes]] that, when combined, make the complex [[Prime Material Plane]]. All of the Elemental Planes are under the [[The Mortal Coil]]'s effect.

These 4 Elemental planes are:

## The Plane of Invigorant
The Plane of Oceans and Forests. An ever spanning ocean covered in island forests. Most plant animal and fungi here are all completely unique all the way down to the individual level. They live and die in incredibly short spans and seem to spawn from the environment itself.

Organisms that do not live and die in uniqueness do live here, but they are uncommon species, like the voracious wasp eels. This is plane supplies the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life giving matter.

## The Plane of Immolation
The Sun of [[Zol]]. The Plane of Immolation is what gives the heat of flame and the radiant light to [[Zol]].

Rumors of a city of flame within Immolation exist, but due to its harsh environment there is little information.

[[The Sun]] is an ever moving portal that passes through sky leading to Immolation.

## The Plane of Temperament
Rock, sand, metal, soil and gemstone. The foundation of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is said that The Plane of Temperament is accessible by taking long lateral journeys through [[The Underdark]]. Supposedly it is difficult to judge when one enters or exits Temperament as it manifests as a ever spanning series of caverns.

Populations of Dangerous [[Giants]] and great chitinous beasts reside in Temperament, some of which even have their own cities.


## The Plane of Tempest
The sky itself. The Plane of Tempest is the most vast and peaceful of [[The Elemental Planes]]. It provides the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life-sustaining oxygen.

It can be accessed via long lateral journeys in the sky. It contains many avian species who travel freely between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and Tempest.

Tempest contains no landmasses, but does house many large beings known as Buoyants. These beings appear like a mix between a whale and a large balloon, and act as a resting place for flying creatures who need it. Large Buoyants even have forests growing on their backs.
