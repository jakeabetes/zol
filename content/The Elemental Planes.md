title: "The Elemental Planes"

*A unique group of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*

Academics are unsure of exactly what forces form the [[Prime Material Plane]], but many theorize it was constructed by overlapping 4 basic elemental [[Planes]] that, when combined, make the complex [[Prime Material Plane]]. All of the Elemental Planes are under the [[The Mortal Coil]]'s effect. Each plane is a surreal, majestic thing of its own right. They are home to strange beings composed almost exclusively of matter and energy pertaining to their respective element. Some of these creatures manifest as beings that are something like a fairy, or a spirit called [[Sylfs]]. These

These 4 Elemental planes are:

## The Plane of Invigorant
The Plane of Oceans and Forests. An ever spanning ocean covered in island forests. Most plant animal and fungi here are all completely unique all the way down to the individual level. They live and die in incredibly short spans and seem to spawn from the environment itself.

Organisms that do not live and die in uniqueness do live here, but they are uncommon species, like the voracious wasp eels. This is plane supplies the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life giving matter.

## The Plane of Immolation
The Sun of [[Zol]]. The Plane of Immolation is what gives the heat of flame and the radiant light to [[Zol]].

Rumors of a city of flame within Immolation exist, but due to its harsh environment there is little information.

[[The Sun]] is an ever moving portal that passes through sky leading to Immolation.

## The Plane of Temperament
Rock, sand, metal, soil and gemstone. The foundation of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is said that The Plane of Temperament is accessible by taking long lateral journeys through [[The Underdark]]. Supposedly it is difficult to judge when one enters or exits Temperament as it manifests as a ever spanning series of caverns.

Populations of Dangerous [[Giants]] and great chitinous beasts reside in Temperament, some of which even have their own cities.


## The Plane of Tempest
The sky itself. The Plane of Tempest is the most vast and peaceful of [[The Elemental Planes]]. It provides the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life-sustaining oxygen.

It can be accessed via long lateral journeys in the sky. It contains many avian species who travel freely between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and Tempest.

Tempest contains no landmasses, but does house many large beings known as Buoyants. These beings appear like a mix between a whale and a large balloon, and act as a resting place for flying creatures who need it. Large Buoyants even have forests growing on their backs.   

## Sylfs
[[Sylfs]] are strange beings, born by unknown means. Their bodies are not corporeal, but they posses very powerful minds. Many think of them as self contained souls, never bound to a body of their own. They can influence the appearance of their physical form, but exist as one of four types:
- **Mistings** who hail from **Invigorant**, appear as constantly shifting creatures of growing plants and flowing water
- **Cindrins** who hail from **Immolation**, appear as beings made from cracked and burning stone
- **Stalegs** who hail from **Temperament**, appear as beings of lightly colored crystal 
- **Typhis** who hail from **Tempest**, appear as beings of flowing wisps of air and small clouds of vapor

[[Sylfs]] are capable of speech, and minor manipulations of the physical world. However the most notable thing about them is their ability to interface with the minds other beings. [[Sylfs]] are known to bond with beings they individually appreciate. This bond allows the being and the sylf to communicate, and grants the being magical power through the will of [[Observance]]. For most this power manifests as a minor affinity for whatever element the sylf is comprised of, but in some cases the bond grows more powerful. A strong bond allows for great feats of magic, and in some cases an individual can manifest their sylf as a physical object.

However this bond is not so easily gained, [[Sylfs]] are known to be very stubborn and elusive. There is only one consistent case of [[Sylfs]] bonding mortals: the [[Genasi]].  [[Genasi]] are a small race of people located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Their home is located in a space where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is considerably thinner. This allows for [[Sylfs]] to move back and forth between the [[Planes]] with ease.

Genasi are born with an appearance and physiology similar to humans, but in the first decade of their lives they typically bond a sylf, this alters their appearance, and grants them abilities. However [[Genasi]] are not the only beings who can receive this bond, but bonds outside of this typical relationship are extremely rare.

When a bond is obtained, it may appear in a number of different ways. Some sylfs like to be very present. Appearing physically to everyone, and speaking vocally. Others may be more shy, speaking and appearing only to their bonded individual. Some are so elusive they only manifest as a deep, subconscious thing, which has been described as an internal friendly presence or emotion. These bonds are very intimate things and extremely hard to break.
