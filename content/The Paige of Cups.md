title: "The Paige of Cups"
---The most powerful of the [[Tarot Ring Bearers]]. [[The Paige of Cups]], or [[Rali Trunsarr]], is the bearer of Paige of Cups ring from [[The Rings of Tarot]], and head of House Cups within the city of [[Zessgorn]]. Her ring was originally thought to be a minorly powerful artifact, until she discovered that the ring she bore allowed her to attune to any number of the lesser rings. This garnered he not only a very high cultural standing within the city of [[Zessgorn]], but also immense physical and magical power.

It is not know exactly what the limits of [[The Paige of Cups]]'s powers are, but many compare her to that of a [[Wordbearer]]. She lies somewhere in between the concepts of high nobility, criminal overlord, and small god. However despite her potential she seems only concerned with her influence over [[Zessgorn]] rather than the goings on of foreign kingdoms.
