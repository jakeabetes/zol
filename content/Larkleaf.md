---A rare plants that only grows in the shade of [[The Kodoros]]. It is a potent alchemical ingredient that strengthens the potency of many ingredients, widens error margins, and can be used in place of many different, pesky ingredients. It is often referred to as the *Alchemists Talent* as it makes an alchemists job much easier, and increases the quality of results.

It is quite expensive, and sought by many. It has stimulated the economy for [[Rockfire]] for many centenaries. It cannot be cultivated easily, so it is gathered rather than farmed.
