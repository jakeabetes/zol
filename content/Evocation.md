[[Evocation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves the direct application of elemental and raw [[energy]]. Evocation is viewed as the weaponization of magic. The general population fears [[Evocation]] for this reason.

This magic can span from launching small motes of raw magical energy, to tearing a rift in the sky and calling a storm of comets to fall on ones enemies. Historically, users of this magic have been known to sway battles and ultimately win wars.
