title: "Sea of Monsters"
---
The remnants of [[Goh'zul]]'s body, endlessly feasted upon by beings who traversed the cosmos to feed on his infinite body.

After [[Goh'zul]] was defeated, he was trapped within [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Unable to sustain his body, he slowly rotted away and died, and powerful beings flocked to the now unclaimed power held within him like ocean scavengers to a whalefall. This sea writhed for many eons, but it was stilled when [[The Watcher in The Door]] spoke [[The First Tongue]], and spun its power into the world of [[Zol]].

[[The Watcher]] was unable to sway the entirety of the endless sea into his new world, but he was able to claim its power. The unchanged parts of the [[Sea of Monsters]] were left empty and horrible. A endless expanse of enraged and hateful monsters who had their boundless feast of carnage and power taken from them. This vacant horror is now known as [[The Void]].
