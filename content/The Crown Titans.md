Crown Titans are individuals given a one of 5 unique powers by **The Crux**. These powers allow a normal person to transform into a massive and powerful titan, capable of incredible feats of strength and destruction. No one knows the origin of this power, but it all revolves around a single individual called The Crux.

The Crux is a genetic power, passed down through generations. One member of each generation gains the powers of The Crux. The Crux's sole abilities are the capacity to choose champions to become titans, and the ability to tap into a titans senses. Some think that The Crux also has increased physical abilities, and maybe even their own titan form, but this is rumor at best. The Titans are all loyal to The Crux, save for the occasional aberrant soul.

Titans are bound by a few rules. It takes a great deal of power to enter their titan form, and can only do so every few days at best. Staying in their form is difficult, and most can only remain as a titan for so long.  If a titan dies, The Crux can make a new titan of the same type after the refractory period it would take for that titan to be able to retake its form. No more of one titan type can exist at a time. Each titan also has a weakness unique to them, and being made titan shortens ones lifespan by over half. Becoming a titan grants one amazing physical power, but the power of a titan is ultimately based on the initial skill of a person before they are made titan.

The titans are as follows:

## The Blade Titan

The Blade Titan is the smallest of the Titans. It stands at about 15 feet tall, and possesses the ability to grow bladed weapons out of its skin. It is an extremely adept fighter with these weapons, and can remain in titan form for nearly a full day. Its weapons are extremely useful to it, however its strangely weak to the material its blades are made from. When not in the hand of The Blade Titan, its weapons degrade into nothing within a matter of minutes.

## The Burning Titan

The Burning Titan is an extremely hard being to kill. It is quite large at about 30 feet tall. The difficulty in killing The Burning Titan comes from the extreme heat it emits. The longer it is in its titan form, the hotter it burns. After about half an hour, merely standing near it singes flesh, making it nearly impossible to approach. However, its burning is its own weakness. The heat quickly destroys its titan form, and is return back to a normal person after only an hour of fighting.

## The Power Titan

The Strongest of the titans. Despite its relatively short size of 25 feet, The Power Titan is the physically strongest of the titans. Some think The Power Titan is the most dangerous of the titans. This is amplified by the fact its weakness is not publicly known, and that it can stay in its titan form indefinitely.

During The [[Alderian Rebellion]], The Power Titan betrayed [[Kapesh]] and fought for the side of the rebels. No one knows exactly what brought the titan at the time to do so, but it killed the other titans dozens of times before their death. Its sacrifice was one of the major reasons for the rebels victory until [[Deepspell]] and their mages joined the rebels side.

## The Sinew Titan

Arguably the most deadly titan. The Sinew Titan's horrifying appearance is one of twisted, grey muscle fibers, and a toothy maw. It stand 50 feet tall, and has many long tendrils coming off of its body. It is likely the most frail of the titans, as its weakness is at each of its main joints. However its long reach given by its very precise control of its tendrils allows it to level forests and armies. Unfortunately for it, The Sinew Titan has a refractory period of many months. It can stay in its form for about 2 hours.

## The Towering Titan

The largest, and most feared of the titans. The Towering Titan is a rare sight on any battle field as it has a refractory period of nearly a year. However its massive size, and blasts of burning light it can shoot from its eyes make it a terrifying foe. The Towering Titan stands about 140 feet tall. Its weakness lies deep beneath the flesh on the back of its neck. It is also very dangerous as when it enters its form, it unleashes a destructive blast that can level buildings. Rumor claims that sometimes entering this form kills the host, and The Crux has to control its body. The Towering Titan can stay in this form for up to 2 hours.
