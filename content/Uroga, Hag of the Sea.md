# Uroga, Hag of The Sea
*Void God of Fathoms, Major Deity*
![[uroga.png]]

Queen of the deep, the most powerful of the mysterious [[Hags]], she who commands the horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean. The most clever of the [[Void Gods]]. Uroga is an absurdly powerful witch who conducts the eldritch horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean.

While Uroga herself is not as powerful as some of the other major deities, her wit and influence over powerful monsters makes her a threat like no other.

Uroga seemingly has a specific interest in [[The Wandering Gods]]. Some academics theorize they hail from the same place of origin. Along with all of the other [[Hags]].

## Depiction
Records of Uroga's form differ wildly. Some claim to see her as a face manifesting from interwoven seaweed or storm clouds. Others claim her to be more humanoid like that of an old woman. Many accounts say she has fish like features.

## Symbolism
A dark circle with tentacle like radially symmetric protrusions.

## Behavior
Uroga is known for making deals with any being who seeks her out. All of these deals come at a great price. These deals typically involve the exchange of power and souls. Commodities which Uroga uses to take control over great monsters and vulnerable mortals.

This gives Uroga a unique edge of control that none of the other [[Void Gods]] have been known to replicate. She controls a vast army of horrible monsters who lurk in the sea.

## Realm
Uroga lurks at the border of [[The Void]] where the ocean gives way to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Here she wars with [[Ohlit]].

## Worshipers
Many cultists or individuals with dark intent seek out Uroga to make dark deals. Promising their souls, sacrifice, or acts of service for her power.
