![[The North Sea 1.png]]

Ocean waters filled with bounties entombed in ice. [[The North Sea]] is a region touch almost exclusively by the viking sailors of [[The Ward]]. Rocked by [[Adrathar]]'s [[Greatwinds]], filled with of icebergs, sea life, and gargantuan monsters. [[The North Sea]] is only for the brave.

[[The North Sea]] is thought to span far into the north east, but eventually narrows out to the very distant reaches of [[The Grand Nothing]] and The Bleak Walls Beyond of [[The Korus Arctic]].

The sea does contain a single city that most believe is only legend: [[Yoel Sundarum]].

## History and Inhabitants
