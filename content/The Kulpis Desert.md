![[The Kulpis Desert.jpg]]

The Burning Sands, The Second Corner. A southwestern desert of beautiful canyons, and seemingly endless dunes. It is filled with all manner of strange creatures evolved to survive in the hot and dry wasteland. Few venture this far south, but those who do usually do so by way of [[Skimmers]]. In their journeys they are sure to  encounter massive sandworms, territorial tribes, ruins that some believe may even predate [[The Awakening]], and heat that increases exponentially the further south you go.

## Points of Interest
- **Old Ashida** - A nexus of ruins left behind by an ancient city. Some say it was destroyed during [[The Dragon War]], but others believe it predates [[The Awakening]].
- **The Wildsands** - A vast expanse of rolling dunes and dangerous creatures.
- **Camp Ogur** - A large bandit camp that was established in response to [[Saen]] becoming part of [[Laenwalde]]. These bandits have existed for many many generations, and are considered to be some of the most reputable rebels against [[Laenwalde]].
- **The Kodoros** - A vast canyon of deep valleys and wide mesas. Some of the larger geological features contain violent volcanic activity. The further south one travels  the darker the stone becomes, all the way to black.
- **Lath Gerun Oasis** - The largest of the few Oasis that exist within the desert. A hub for creature life.
- **The Pit of Lath Gerun** - A wide, mysterious pit that descends deep into [[The Underdark]]. No one knows why it exists.
- **The Jagged Jungle** - An alien jungle of spiny cacti. Populated by strange armored reptiles, tiny rodents, and nimble birds. This area does not attract many visitors.
- **The Ashcamps** - The southern most settlement in all of [[Zol]]. The ash camps are populated by wild people, called 'The Ashen' who have adapted to live in extreme heat and isolation. They are very territorial and distrusting of outsiders.
- **Tal'Deraag** - A vast stretch of extreme volcanic activity. Lava and ash are spewed dangerously in this region. If you are somehow able to navigate the threats of the environment, it will be the monsters that reside here that get you. Tal'Deraag stretches as far as the eye can see, eventually consuming [[The Kodoros]] in the far south. What lies beyond is masked in clouds of ash.

## Climate
The northern parts of this region are considered to be desert while the south is referred to as an inferno.
