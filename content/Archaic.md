*The Bastion of Knowledge and History*
![[archaic skyline.png]]

Archaic, The Eldest city of [[Zol]]. Archaic sits nested in the northern foothills of [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]. Archaic is coveted for its ancient buildings formed of massive light grey stone slabs, and coveted library known simply as [[The Archives]] which is held within the campus of [[The Kybis Assembly]].

[[The Kybis Assembly]] is one of [[Zol]]'s prestigious academic institutions. Unlike its rival, [[Kerketh Academy]] which looks to innovation and a better future, the Assembly looks to gain the lost secrets of the past. This is done by uncovering secrets from before [[The Undoing]] and unraveling the mysteries of [[The Old Tongue]].

On top of that, the Assembly is very secretive and protective of their information. The whole city is very strict and many visitors complain about constantly feeling *watched*. |

| Students | Social Class/Academic Station | Those at the lowest level of education within the Assembly.

| Preceptors | Social Class/Academic Station | The second highest level within [[The Kybis Assembly]].

## Authority
The city is overseen by Lord Philen Boran, servant to [[King Galliard]]. Lord Boran is an old and sickly human man that is fiercely loyal to the crown.

Notably within the city, [[The Kybis Assembly]] does not respond to the authority of Lord Boran, but instead only listens to the [[Galliard Crown]] itself. Some within the city believe that the Grand Insightors have more authority than the city lord himself.

### Laws
The city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]], but many say the Assembly does not have these laws forced upon them.

## Modern Importance
In modern day [[Archaic]] is seen as a powerful resource to [[Kapesh]]. This is due to the influence of [[The Kybis Assembly]] on the grand scale. The assembly is much smaller in numbers than [[Kerketh Academy]] or [[The University]], but its members are statistically much more skilled and dangerous.

Entry into the assembly is very difficult as it is extremely expensive and requires recommendation from an upstanding member of Kapeshian society.

The Assembly is mostly made up of [[Humans]]. Some claim this is just because of its location while others believe that it a product of racism. However the university has been accepting more and more students of various backgrounds over the years.

## Historical Importance
Archaic is the oldest city in all of [[Zol]].

## Other Things of Note
- Those cast out from the Assembly are typically executed publicly if there is due cause, or die under mysterious circumstances if their departure does not merit execution.
