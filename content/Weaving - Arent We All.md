title: "Weaving - Aren't We All"

Haith absentmindedly fastened his baldric as he wondered at the white stone walls. A castle built from sleeping power. He was ready for the day now, but had no desire to prematurely end his privacy. Their campaign in Alderun was supposed to be over now, and this detour had left him in a sour mood. More than usual, at least.

"Shouldn't you be in Kapesh?" A taunting, feminine voice came from the corner of his room. Haith turned nonchalantly to see Kalimae. The slender woman had snuck in and reclined in one of the chamber's cushy chairs.

"Shouldn't you be in mourning?" Haith gave flatly, meandering over to the chair across from her and slumping down into it. He didn't look like it, but he was glad to see her. Private, equal company was a rare thing.

Kalimae leaned forward, snatching up a bit of sliced yellow fruit from a tray between them. "If the plan had actually involved me marrying that arrogant little momma's boy I would have killed myself a week ago."

That won a genuine, albeit small smirk from Haith. "May he find peace in Aeordel's embrace." He gave sarcastically, grabbing a few slices for himself.

"So why are you here?" Kalimae stood, stretching.

Haith shrugged "Dunno. I think he had another one of his visions." Haith said the last with implication. Kalimae raised an eyebrow at his insubordinate tone.

"Wow," She chuckled, "look at the pair on you. Having doubts are we?"

"What?" Haith snapped defensively, "No I—"

"It's fine, Haith. I know the feeling." Kalimae said the last grimly, then made a dismissive gesture. Her dark hair glowing hazel in morning light that poured through an easterly window. Overlooking The Grand Nothing. Awkward silence took the space before Haith eventually changed the subject.

"Those no-kills from Tenzentak are here. Saw them walk through the front gate with Gideon this morning." Haith gestured at a different window that faced Pale Ward's entrance. A landmark much further than any normal person could see from their tower. "Any idea why?"

"Other than to get in my way? No idea." Kalimae reached over to pet her cat as it emerged from behind a curtain. He'd have to get a new room now. Inheritor or not he was still allergic to cats.

"They're definitely weapons." Haith did a poor job masking his annoyance at the sight of her familiar.

"Aren't we all?" Kalimae teased as she lifted her cat who gave an enthusiastic purr. Brandishing him as if he were a threat to the demigod. "What's your take on them?"

Haith sat back, as if giving it real thought for the first time. "Well they're all vizians, but that's to be expected. The Goliath and The Mutant's ultimate purpose is obvious. Power housed like that is dangerous. For better or worse."

Kalimae nodded, having come to the same conclusion herself. "I thought maybe Sherman was one of ours, but I'm not so certain any more. I don't think I've ever seen a warforged change so quickly."

"You think he has anything to do with that whole Autonom thing?"

"Too much of a coincidence for it not to be. But in that case he'd be less of a weapon and more of a," Kalimae searched for the right word. "contingency."

"What about The Westerner? What's his name again? Bozmin?" Haith guessed. He hated having to learn people's names.

"Chronolich." Kalimae responded with certainty, as if proud of herself for coming to the conclusion.

"Chrono-what?" Haith shook his head in confusion. Speaking to Kailmae was refreshing, but Haith often felt she was too smart for her own good.

"It means," She started, cutting herself off. "Don't worry about it, just think of him as… more clever than he looks."

Haith gave a resigned sigh. He nearly dismissed the topic, but a final question occurred to him. "What about the one with the mask?"

Kalimae laughed, "No idea, but I think that's the point."\
