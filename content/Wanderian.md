## Overview
[[Wanderian]] belief is the religious denomination of Wanderer-Centric belief. It is a relatively uncommon, and unstructured belief system. It is based in the idea that [[Gods]] are not infallible, divine entitles. Rather that they are beings who hold a great deal of power, and are actually more likely to make mistakes because of it. [[Wanderian]] scripture teaches the idea that individuals must learn to live in a world where [[Gods]] are imperfect, and that one should hope that [[Gods]] reflect this same perspective.

These ideals are taught in the scriptures of [[The Wandering Gods]]. A group of strange [[Gods]] believed to be of some alien origin. [[Wanderian]] belief says that [[The Wandering Gods]] are beings who seek to teach, rather than rule. It is said they came to [[Zol]] after [[The Undoing]] from some far off place in [[The Cosmos]]. They came to teach their morals to the people of [[Zol]], and its [[Gods]].

## Scripture Outline
### Creation Belief
[[Wanderian]] scripture does not burden itself with explaining the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]] like other [[Religious Denominations]] often do. However, some fringe texts claim that [[The Wandering Gods]] were the beings who actually slayed [[Goh'zul]] long, long ago.

### Ancient Society
[[Wanderian]] scripture does not burden itself with explaining the nature of ancient [[Zol]] and its people.

### The Undoing
[[Wanderian]] scripture does not burden itself with explaining the nature of [[The Undoing]]. However, many of the faith believe that [[The Undoing]] was caused by the ire of [[Gods]]. This is assumption is often made based on the religion's other teaching regarding the dangerous nature of the power held by [[Gods]].

## Church Structure
[[Wanderian]] worship does not have much structure. It is most often practiced on an individual level. However, there are a few churches that do exist. These places do not have the grand hierarchy that larger belief systems like [[Trinaism]] and [[Dorian]] belief do.

Churches formed in honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] may be organized to honor all of [[The Wandering Gods]], or just one of them. These churches are usually led by a singular **Priest**, though sometimes there are multiple priests.

## Followers
### Modernist
Modernist belief largely focuses on the idea of learning a single moral of one of [[The Wandering Gods]]. This typically manifests as a journey of self discovery to ideally become a better person.

### Fundamentalist
Fundamentalist belief largely focuses on the idea of justice and protection of the weak. Fundamentalist Wanderians have been known to strike out at systems the feel are morally wrong. Often with violence.
