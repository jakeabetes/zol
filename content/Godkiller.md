*Who killed a god... and why?*
![[the dead warforged with title.png]]

*The death of [[Giriam]], the Zolaen God of Agriculture and Fertility, has thrown [[Zol]] into an unprecedented era. No one knows exactly what, or who killed this god. Mortals werenâ€™t even told of his death by other gods until the catastrophic effects were seen in everyday life.*

*Theological panic, famine and wildly differing birth rates grip [[The Three Corners]]. These challenges acted as the seeds for secondary forms of chaos like tension between kingdoms, plague, [[Warforged]] rebellions, and may have even caused many [[Dragons]] to awaken from*
*their millennia long slumber...*
