If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul in death, they are sent to limbo to undergo a trial. Trials vary for each soul. Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution. The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death.

Known for being full of ruins, prisons, war torn battle fields, and chains. [[Limbo]] is thought to be a dead plane that was consumed by [[Goh'zul]] and brought from the void to be used by [[The Coilwalker]].

[[Limbo]]'s surface is is barren, covered in an ever present grey light and dead plants. Sharp rocks, deserts, and still oceans compose its geography.
