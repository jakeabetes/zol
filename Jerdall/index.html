Home to the <a class="internal-link broken">Drow</a>, the city is a place of unique culture and unusual beauty. Its people hold traditions of deep legends and shared songs. Protected from outside influences by its giant iron gate, <a href=/zol/Jerdall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Jerdall>Jerda&rsquo;ll</a> is truly a sight and sound to behold. Its people are known to sing and play old songs called <a class="internal-link broken">The Acrylons</a>. These pieces of music are said to aid them in their daily pursuits, share emotion, honor their dead, and protect their oldest stories from the withering effects of time. <a class="internal-link broken">The Acrylons</a> can almost always be heard within the city in some capacity. Blacksmiths singing songs of metal work, pedestrians humming tunes that denote their mood or journey&rsquo;s purpose, city guard chanting low simple songs of order. All of these songs meld and harmonize together when performed in proximity, as if they were part of some greater, singular composition. These melodies are taught to children parallel with things like language, and etiquette. <a class="internal-link broken">The Acrylons</a> give a sense of community, synchronicity, and connectedness to all people of the city. Their echoing through the caves fills the city with a sense of heartfelt warmth on good days, and a haunted feeling on darker ones. It is said that a <a class="internal-link broken">Drow</a> far from home can touch a raw stone and hear the songs of their people.</p><p><div class=container><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-/zol/jerdall.png><label for=zoomCheck-/zol/jerdall.png><img src=/zol/jerdall.png width=auto></label></div></p><a href=#overview><h2 id=overview><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Overview</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main Opportunity</td><td>Citizens of <a href=/zol/Jerdall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Jerdall>Jerda&rsquo;ll</a> posses <a class="internal-link broken">The Acrylons</a>, a unique form of musical communication that creates an interconnected society amongst the <a class="internal-link broken">Drow</a>. The city&rsquo;s people can react and respond to the song they hear around them. An uneducated eye may think the city moves like a machine, where each person fits into a functional box and their songs mesh together like the teeth of gears. The truth is more like the innerworkings of nature. There is an everchanging flow to the city, but you can see its truths if you know how to listen for it.</td></tr><tr><td>Main Challenge</td><td>Residing underground can be an isolating way of life. However this is favorable to many <a class="internal-link broken">Drow</a>. So favored in fact, they keep their gates barred shut for to all outside parties.
