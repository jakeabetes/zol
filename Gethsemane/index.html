It&rsquo;s dominated largely by <a class="internal-link broken">The Forest of Yan Nalora</a>. A wood of massive trees, crystal streams, as well as strange and dangerous creatures. Tucked into the north are its two mountain cities. The peak city of <a class="internal-link broken">Ep Drukar</a>, and the subterranean city of <a class="internal-link broken">Mod Dranor</a>.</p><p>These cities, located in <a href=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira>The Peaks of Myth&rsquo;ira</a>, a grand and perilous range of mountains overlook the garden kingdom.</p><p>A second subterranean city is located near central <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">Jerda&rsquo;ll</a> is a kingdom of <a class="internal-link broken">Drow</a> built within the colossal caves that wind beneath the land.

These individuals initially met the same hardships as everyone else, however after a short while they learned that they could live symbiotically with the wilds through knowledge, <a href=/zol/Magic rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Magic>Magic</a>, and a mutual respect for the environments they lived in.</p><p>The <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> mined into the mountains to construct their kingdom of <a class="internal-link broken">Mod Dranor</a>, and the <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> built grand cities highlighting the natural beauty which was already present. The <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> discovered the presence of one another quite early on. These groups were cautious at first, but found that through mutual respect the cities could coexist.</p><p>To the south was a region known as The Badlands. A feudal realm that would eventually go on to become <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a>. <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> played an instrumental hand in the forming of this kingdom through support of troops and resources during particular hardship. <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> is especially to thank for the current state of <a href=/zol/Eucaren rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Eucaren>Eucaren</a>, the north-eastern, and neighboring third of <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a>. <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> and <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> are close allies to this day.</p><p>Across <a href=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea>The Narrow Sea</a>, the kingdoms of <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a> was being formed. They would go on to become a rivalling kingdom for more than a thousand years. <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> battled <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a> on and off in a conflict known as the <a href=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles>Triumvirate Battles</a>. A war incited by racial and religious differences.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until much later (the year 2811) that the <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> discovered that there was a whole city of <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> located within the far west peaks of the mountains. This came as a surprise to all parties involved, but there was no major issues that arose as the <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a>&rsquo;s lifestyle and demeanor was already very on par with the rest of the kingdom. The <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> were determined to be <a class="internal-link broken">Off-Human</a>, a label problematic within the conflicts surrounding the <a href=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles>Triumvirate Battles</a>. However <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> decided to let the city be as they had remained in the mountains for over two thousand years without ever causing as much as a stir.</p><p>In the late <a href=/zol/First-Age rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/First-Age>First Age</a>, <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> and their ally <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> faced a great deal of political infighting. When investigated, the source of this infighting seemed to stem from <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> masking as important members of their society. This sparked a conflict known as the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a> where <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> and <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> attacked The Reach. It amounted to one of their cities, <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a>, nearly being destroyed. The conflict stopped when a very powerful <a href=/zol/Wordbearer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Wordbearer>Wordbearer</a> called <a class="internal-link broken">Ehmalog, Word of Wrath</a> entered the fray to the defense of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a>.</p><p>Eventually in the early <a class="internal-link broken">Second Age</a> <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> set aside their differences and formed the <a href=/zol/The-Triumvirate rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Triumvirate>The Triumvirate</a> Concord to end their fighting.</p><a href=#inhabitants><h2 id=inhabitants><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inhabitants</h2></a><p>Largely populated with <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a>, <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a>, and a small population of <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a>.</p><p>Save for the <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> city of <a class="internal-link broken">Ep Drukar</a>, <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> is an extremely proud and xenophobic kingdom. Each city holds a very important identity and its citizens do not respond well to anything that may harm it. The <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> of <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> live long lives and spend most of them focused on upholding or improving their society.</p><p>There are members of other <a class="internal-link broken">Races</a> sprinkled throughout the kingdom, but these individuals are seen as outsiders. However they may be welcomed in if they have something special like a well honed skill or gift to offer elven society.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> have a mutual respect but tend to view each other as <em>lesser</em>. Elves think dwarves are bull headed, slow witted, and do not have appreciation for the beauty in art. Dwarves think elves are weak bodied, frivolous, and unproductive beings. They do cohabitate in some cities, but usually in neighborhoods dominated by members of their own race.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> are people of tradition. They reside high in <a href=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira>The Peaks of Myth&rsquo;ira</a>. Rarely leaving their territory, they went undiscovered for many many years. When they were found, the cities of <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> determined that they were a peaceful group and would be welcomed into their borders. In reality, very little changed. The <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> remained in their home and the <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> didn&rsquo;t bother them for the most part. A few curious members from each population did mingle and explore each other&rsquo;s cities. This behavior sparked a small movement of <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> who venture out on pilgrimages into distant society.</p><a href=#government-economy-and-laws><h2 id=government-economy-and-laws><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government, Economy, and Laws</h2></a><p>The Kingdom of <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> are not governed by a single figure. Each city governs itself and its surrounding territory. The kingdoms do not operate as a council like <a href=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun>The Free Cities of Alderun</a>, but rather a very strong, millennia old alliance.</p><p>Each city cares for its citizens in its own way. Those who have legitimate citizenship do not go without even if they are not financially stable. In Elven society it is very rare someone does not strive to contribute in some way to their city. Even if they do not they could still easily find food, shelter, and medicine (but its likely they would be looked down upon if they are able bodied). In dwarven society work is assigned if it is not sought out, and disobeying these orders is seen as criminal. The <a class="internal-link broken">Genasi</a> have a socialist approach to their city and their slow way of life rarely raises issues. In all cases the sick and elderly are taken care of without question.</p><p>Each city is responsible for creating and upholding their own laws.</p><a href=#arts-culture-and-religion><h2 id=arts-culture-and-religion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arts, Culture, and Religion</h2></a><p>Art and culture is very deep seated within the cities of <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a>.</p><p>The <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> are known for creating nature-inspired majesty. They practice nearly every craft one could imagine. Individuals spend their entire lives honing their abilities to great heights. This is visible all throughout their societies. Grand architecture, beautiful clothing, fantastic sculptures and paintings, even their armor and weaponry is awe inspiring.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> treasure strength, quality, and practicality. This is visible in their cities, homes, tools, and general ways of life. Known for carving their homes and building directly from <a href=/zol/Kalamdola rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kalamdola>Kalamdola</a>, their home mountain. Powerful square architecture, engineered with comprehensive mathematics and geometry.</p><p>Echoes of their grand city are seen in their smaller works of craftsmanship as well. The precise support pattern upholding the grand bridges that span over the city are sewn into the hemming of garments. The layouts of crucial buildings are embossed onto their army&rsquo;s shields.</p><p>Most important to the <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> is the craft of smiting. The tools, weapons, and armor crafted within the city of <a class="internal-link broken">Mod Dranor</a> are the finest in all the Three Corners.</p><p>Almost all the people within the kingdom all follow some version of Trinity-Centric or Zolaen-Centric belief.</p><a href=#academics-and-magic><h2 id=academics-and-magic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Academics and Magic</h2></a><p>Academics and Magic within <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> are taught exclusively through mentorship. Nearly all individuals the kingdom spend the first centaury of their life under the mentorship of a set of teachers who specialize in different crafts. Individuals will go on to specialize in craftsmanship, art, magic, academics, or some other career. They will typically go on to spend the majority of their lives in this profession.</p><p>Notably, <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> does not implement <a href=/zol/Iron-Light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Iron-Light>Iron Light</a> as abundantly as the rest of the Three Corners does. This is due to a deep seated pretention around the concept of <a href=/zol/Great-Magic rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Great-Magic>Great Magic</a>, a highly debated racial issue regarding <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Dwarves</a> being more magically gifted than <a class="internal-link broken">Off-Human</a> races. This held belief has made it so <a href=/zol/Artificers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Artificers>Artificers</a> of <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> utilize <a href=/zol/Imbuement-Perpetuum rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Imbuement-Perpetuum>Imbuement Perpetuum</a> for the production of their magical implements. <a href=/zol/Iron-Light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Iron-Light>Iron Light</a> does exist within the kingdom, it is just uncommon and looked down upon.</p><a href=#political-climate><h2 id=political-climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Political Climate</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> has a very static inner political structure. The people of the cities have great love for their rulership, and the rulers themselves are all on good terms with each other. There is no one ruler or capital, but outsiders tend to view <a href=/zol/Xerul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Xerul>Xerul</a> as its defacto capital due to its resources, size, grandeur, and mythos around the <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a>.</p><p>This makes <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> a powerhouse of a kingdom and all who have trifled with them have paid the price. Historically, <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> has gone to war with all of its surrounding regions and has never lost. It is not involved in any conflict, but there have always been great tensions with <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> since the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a>.</p><p>The people of the kingdom are largely xenophobic, or racist towards outsiders.
