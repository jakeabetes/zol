Famed for its adherence to <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>, an extremely ordered way of living. The city was a bastion of the north. This sadly changed during the height of the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a> when the city was attacked and one of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>, a relic called <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, was lost. This object, central to the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> culture has never been recovered. Most believe it was destroyed, but some think it was stolen by invading forces. Regardless, its absence has damaged the city&rsquo;s order and culture greatly. The city is now upon hard times, and has been for around half a centaury. Despite losing <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, the people of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> continue to revere the site where it was once held, attempting to maintain their ordered beliefs and society. The empty pedestal that once held <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> does not provide the grounds required for such a complex belief system, but it is still desperately worshiped by the city&rsquo;s people.</p><p>Now, the city has growing disorder and crime. <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> are beginning to lay down their old traditions. <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a> has now become too cumbersome for many, and they are choosing to lead lives unguided by the many rules of <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. The city&rsquo;s authority has attempted to rebalance things, but to little avail.</p><p>On the opposite end of things, the fanatical members of society have begun to lash out in different ways. Some claim <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>&rsquo;s absence to be a test, and worship even more than the Changelings have done traditionally. Others strike out at those who deviate from the ways of old.

While tragic, it gives a direct view into the heart of such a unique people and culture. Witnessing the daily life of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> is like looking through geological layers of history all the way back to <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>, and possibly even before. The <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> have such a long standing, well documented history of their people. It begins when the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> found themselves in possession of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a> after <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>. Bearing no memories, they possessed a strange reverence and understanding of the relics, despite their lack of memories. All their traditions were built around them, and the removal of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> exposes the nature of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> and its people in a very tangible way.</td></tr><tr><td>Main Challenge</td><td>It is no secret that <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> struggles. Those who don&rsquo;t leave the city either cling to echoes of a fading past, or stray from their traditions into the bleak unknown. Disorder plagues its days, and there does not seem to be an end in sight. Many outsiders frequently ask why those who seek to maintain their traditions don&rsquo;t emigrate to <a href=/zol/Corinth rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Corinth>Corinth</a>. Some do, but in Changeling culture, the oldshard one is born near is thought to play a distinct role in ones life. They believe that the oldshard they are not attuned with cannot connect with them.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate</td><td>Continental</td></tr><tr><td>Cuisine</td><td>Exotic farmed goods, fish, exotic spices</td></tr><tr><td>Export</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr><td>Outer Villages</td><td>Some</td></tr><tr><td>City Leader</td><td>Yemodhan Surrite</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Language(s)</td><td>Changeling</td></tr><tr><td>Majority Racial Group(s)</td><td><a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a></td></tr><tr><td>Majority Religion(s)</td><td>Exaltation Obscura of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#major-features><h2 id=major-features><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Major Features</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Distinguishing Features</td><td>Costal, River valley/Hilltop</td></tr><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Sleek obsidian brick, sharp features, tall buildings, elongated and thin detail-work</td></tr><tr><td>Color(s)</td><td>Yellow, Black and Red</td></tr><tr><td>Symbolism</td><td>A tall and narrow trapezoid with the wide part on top (The symbol of <a href=/zol/The-Vertex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Vertex>The Vertex</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Defenses</td><td>Remote, hostile terrain, army of <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> highly skilled in covert and deceptive warfare, High walls, allies with <a class="internal-link broken">The Word of Wrath</a></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#people-groups><h2 id=people-groups><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>People Groups</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shardwitnesses</td><td>Religious/Political Station</td><td>Those elected to lead the city, and bear witness to the guidance of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>. However now that the city&rsquo;s oldshard is missing, this group now acts to guide and manage the city as best than can in its absence. They are a group that is formed of the most respected range of citizens, they live highly regulated lives by the rules of <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. At their head sits the city&rsquo;s Shardcaller, Yemodhan Surrite. Shardwitnesses are similar in their influence to foreign nobility, but lead very strict and humble lifestyles. Those who become Shardwitnesses must be nominated many people (peers, mentors, and authorities) and also prove themselves by means of written essay, and engagement in political and philosophical debate.</td></tr><tr><td>The Public</td><td>General populace</td><td>The people of the city are faced with great social and political struggles. The systems established by <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a> originally created much infrastructure for <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> of all kinds, but with the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> the people are divided. Some cling to what once was, others deviate into new ways of living.</td></tr><tr><td>Members of <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a></td><td>Academic Station</td><td>Scholars and philosophers tasked with teaching and understanding the world. Specifically through the lens of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>. Members of this school pursue careers in magic, scholarship, and teaching. All people of the city from ages 8-15 participate in learning at <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a>. The school provides many levels of education, and is a repository of some of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s most obscure knowledge due to its influences, and removal from the rest of the world. Some members of <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a> are rumored to be tasked with making long pilgrimages to distant lands, bearing changeling disguise, to return with knowledge not yet possessed by <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a>. The highest ranking members of <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a> are all Shardwitnesses. <a class="internal-link broken">The Eelynn</a> within <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> is facing unprecedented times without <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a></td></tr><tr><td>Tarsects</td><td>Local authority</td><td>A branch of local guard who are tasked with policing the very minute details of the <a href=/zol/Glassian-Laws rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Glassian-Laws>Glassian Laws</a>. They are not allowed to make arrests, but they are responsible for reporting infractions and doling out fines. Since <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a>&rsquo;s population has begun to deviate from <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>, Tarsects are very controversial figures. Some appreciate their services, others hate them.</td></tr><tr><td>Outsiders</td><td>Racial Group</td><td>The few non-changeling members of society. In the whole city there are less than 15, and each of them has special permission to live within the city. Typically it is for some service they can provide to <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a>. Their social lives are very delicate things as <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> are not trusting of outsiders. <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> is a particularly dangerous place to outsiders, as some fanatics are violent towards them.</td></tr><tr><td>Progressive Citizens</td><td>Political Group</td><td>Those changelings who seek a new way of life not dictated by <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. The absence of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> has made a good portion of the population believe they do not need their lives to be so organized. Some are very normal citizens, while others are fanatics. Making organized protests against the ways of old, or even taking full-blown criminal action.</td></tr><tr><td>Conservative Citizens</td><td>Political Group</td><td>Those changelings who try and maintain, or restore the ways of old. These individuals adhere closely to <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. They treat the holy site where <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> was once held with the same reverence as if it were still there. Some are very normal citizens, while others are fanatical. Fanatics are known to cling to the ways of old even more than most citizens of <a href=/zol/Corinth rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Corinth>Corinth</a>. Some even go as far as taking violent action against those who deviate from tradition.</td></tr><tr><td>The Maezerat</td><td>Militant Group</td><td>A collection of fanatical <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> who still believe <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> survives. This sect of warriors organized within the city sends mercenaries far and wide in search for their lost relic.</td></tr><tr><td>Still Changelings</td><td>Misc</td><td>A group of some changelings who have been born around 500 years after the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a> who were not born with the capacity to change their appearance. About 1 in every 100 <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> within <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> is born this way.

Some evidence of this pointed to the interference of <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> began proffering threats towards <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a>. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> denied these claims.

At this time, it was seeming like <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> would soon be conquered.
