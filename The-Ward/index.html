Its cities are built upon rocky cliffs, their halls and longhouses formed of stone and unique, indigenous wood resistant to breaking under high winds. The cities cling precariously to the edges of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> itself. The people who live there are hardy, fierce, and no stranger to fighting against the elements or facing down the terrors of the sea.</p><p>The storms, known as <a href=/zol/Greatwinds rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Greatwinds>Greatwinds</a> that rage across the kingdom are a fearsome force, capable of destroying entire villages in a single night. But the people of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>&rsquo;s cities are all to used to this hardship, and they have learned to weather the storms well. They build their homes to be strong and sturdy, with thick walls and roofs designed to withstand the strongest gales.

The waters around their realm are home to all manner of monsters and beasts, including dragons, sea serpents, and giant krakens. But <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>&rsquo;s Vikings are fearless sailors, and they take to the seas with confidence, using their long ships to brave the waves and explore the unknown.</p><p>Overall, <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is a rough and rugged place, shaped by the forces of nature and the will of the gods.

However many believe it does not even exist.</p><a href=#wilderness-and-climate><h2 id=wilderness-and-climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Wilderness and Climate</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is famously rocked by devastating storms on a weekly basis. These storms, thought to be sent by <a href=/zol/Adrathar-Father-of-the-Wind rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar-Father-of-the-Wind>Adrathar, Father of the Wind</a> are said to be of a divine purpose. Regardless of their intention, the winds would destroy any other part of <a href=/zol/The-Three-Corners rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Three-Corners>The Three Corners</a> in a single day. However <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is no normal kingdom. Millennia of destructive winds have shaped the kingdom, its people, and its wilderness into something nigh unbreakable.</p><p>The Storms themselves come on a semi regular basis. The slight irregularity of their arrival is not well understood, but their coming is heralded by individuals of a profession known as <a href=/zol/Stormcallers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormcallers>Stormcallers</a>. This task was made easier when it was discovered that Luna, one of <a href=/zol/The-Moons rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Moons>The Moons</a> of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> displayed regular patterns on its shifting surface when the storm is 3 days out. This allowed <a href=/zol/Stormcallers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormcallers>Stormcallers</a> to better approximate the approach and greatly reduced the casualties of the profession.</p><p>The Storm is spotted as a large wave and massive cumulonimbus illuminated by lightning. At a distance, it appears as an unmoving wall of could. However its massive size is deceptive, as the storm moves at remarkable speed. This manifestation of weather is know as The Surge. The first challenge The Surge poses is the wave of sea water it pushes. The Ward has overcome this challenge by constructing several breakwaters along the coast that take the brunt of the impact. These must be rebuilt after every storm. When The Surge makes landfall it is accompanied by a loud sound similar to that of something breaking the sound barrier. The initial impact is strong enough to throw boulders the size of of large dogs.</p><p>To survive this, the people of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> reside in very strong structures specially made to deflect the wind. It is culturally recognized that when The Surge approaches, everyone ties down everything not bound to a foundation, and bunkers down inside. You could be fist fighting your worst enemy in the street, but when the winds come you table any conflict you have and get inside. Oddly, The Surge is not stopped by magical barriers. Many fool hearty <a href=/zol/Caster rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Caster>Caster</a>s have died thinking they could best the elements.</p><p>Plants have adapted unique methods of dealing with the high winds. Low grasses and bushes will fully recede into the ground when agitated. The needles of conifer trees will retract into their branches like cat claws while their trunks depend on their natural strength and and extremely deep taproots for stability.</p><p>Many animals have developed migratory behaviors, burrows, or armored exteriors to weather the storms. The beasts of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> are also a good indicator of coming storms within the span of a day or so.</p><p>After The Surge passes, The Cascade begins. An approximately 2 hour long heavy downpour of rain still has winds high enough to throw a person to the ground.</p><p>After The Cascade comes the <a href=/zol/Stormdew rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormdew>Stormdew</a>. A unique phenomena where the heavy rain fades to a light drizzle over the course of about 2 minutes and a substance called <a href=/zol/Stormdew rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormdew>Stormdew</a> falls with it. <a href=/zol/Stormdew rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormdew>Stormdew</a> is a blueish-white, malleable substance that feels almost like clay. It is thought to be organic in nature but no one knows exactly what it is. Surprisingly it can be eaten or used as medicine, and is used everywhere in <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>&rsquo;s culture. It has a maple-like taste to it in the first half of its shelf life, that turns to a more acidic citrus flavor in its later stages of fermentation. It has a shelf life of just over a week, which works well as the falling of fresh <a href=/zol/Stormdew rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormdew>Stormdew</a> tends to overlap with the final days of the last forage.</p><p><a href=/zol/Stormdew rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormdew>Stormdew</a> is left all over <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> in small deposits that look like little soft coins. It is foraged quickly and packed into jars once the rain begins to dry. It is used in baking, brewing and medicine. Sadly its short shelf life makes it very rare outside <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>.</p><p>The odd natural world that exists only within <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is a largely continental climate, but parts do see warm weather on a good day. Its shy plants, and armored beasts cover its beautiful landscape in abundance vanishing like specters at the sign of a storm leaving a barren wasteland of destruction. Then, without fail, the glory of its winding rivers and streams, now full to their brims with fresh fallen water, attract the animals to their edges. The flora soon blossoms from its safe hiding places and the strange cycle begins again.</p><a href=#history><h2 id=history><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>History</h2></a><p>After <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>, the people of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> found themselves in the most dangerous of regions that would later become the kingdoms. When the unprepared people were rocked by the storm for the first time, their population was more than halved. The survivors found refuge in caves near the base of <a href=/zol/Stormwall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormwall>Stormwall</a>. For many years they would struggle in flooding caves, slowly discovering methods of surviving out in the storm.</p><p>Eventually, structural and agricultural methods had become advanced enough to support life on the surface. Many migrated to the seaside to harvest the bountiful aquatic life, while some stayed behind living more primitive lives.</p><p>Six cities were constructed: Weldar, Vauz, Margith, <a href=/zol/Fike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Fike>Fike</a>, <a href=/zol/Often rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Often>Often</a>, and <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a>. These cities prospered within the kingdoms unique way of life for many centauries. This was until the final years of <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> drove many dragons to the North-East near <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>. This gave the region a disproportionately high number of dragons.</p><p>The final years of <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> were exceedingly difficult on <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>. The Cities of Weldar, Vauz, and Margith were destroyed. The other cities likely would have been obliterated as well, if not for the kingdoms sole advantage: the storm. The <a href=/zol/Dragons rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dragons>Dragons</a> were not able to predict the coming storm as well as the citizens of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> were. When this was discovered, the dragons were baited out to die in the destructive winds. When the dragons caught on, brave warriors would hide in the dragons&rsquo; lairs to ambush, or even capture them when they tried to take shelter from the storms. These tactics would eventually go on to win <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> in favor of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>.</p><p>The people of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> have spent the majority of their history in isolation from the other kingdoms, only interacting with <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a>, <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>, and <a href=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun>The Free Cities of Alderun</a> on occasion for things like the exchange of goods and services. They have never gone to war with another kingdom, but this does not make them a stranger to warfare.</p><p>The cities of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> were originally all under their own rulership, each by an appointed throne called an <a href=/zol/Archon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Archon>Archon</a>. These rulers all followed the leadership of Weldar&rsquo;s ruler, the Grand <a href=/zol/Archon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Archon>Archon</a>. This balance was not respected for long as many of the cities were too proud to respect the rule of another.</p><p>Skirmishes between cities began, both on land and at sea. They typically amounted to nothing more than an intense rivalry, but occasionally a city would have to surrender resources, or may even be captured for a short while. These bouts of conflict happened on and off until <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a>. To unite against their larger foe, the cities created a pact called <a href=/zol/The-North-Honor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-North-Honor>The North Honor</a> which disallowed fighting between the cities.</p><p>After <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> there was peace for over a millennia. The kingdom never rebuilt its lost cities due to its slow way of life and lost resources, but its citizens were happy. Then in the year 3842, the city of <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a> attacked the city of <a href=/zol/Fike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Fike>Fike</a> in an attempt to claim it, breaking <a href=/zol/The-North-Honor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-North-Honor>The North Honor</a>. This rekindled the conflicts between cities. Now <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a> exists in isolation, attempting to overthrow its allied neighbors <a href=/zol/Fike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Fike>Fike</a> and <a href=/zol/Often rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Often>Often</a>.</p><p>The <a href=/zol/Archon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Archon>Archon</a> of <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a> at the time, a Goliath man called Kereth Fjall, began to call himself the Grand <a href=/zol/Archon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Archon>Archon</a>, the first time the title had been used in many generations. Apparently, his turning on his allies was sparked by a series of prophetic dreams that his lineage would rebuild <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> into the most powerful kingdom in all of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>. Even in modern days his descendants uphold his dream, and push the conflict further.</p><p><a href=/zol/Often rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Often>Often</a> and <a href=/zol/Fike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Fike>Fike</a> are bound by <a href=/zol/The-North-Honor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-North-Honor>The North Honor</a>, they fight justly and honorably to attempt to uphold the peace that used to be. <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a> however uses any means necessary to win a conflict, as they idealize true strength as tenacity and fortitude over honor. They even continue the old, dark method of enslaving lesser <a href=/zol/Dragons rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dragons>Dragons</a> to aid them in combat.</p><a href=#inhabitants><h2 id=inhabitants><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inhabitants</h2></a><p>Populated by mostly <a href=/zol/Humans rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Humans>Humans</a> and <a href=/zol/Goliaths rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Goliaths>Goliaths</a>, and a minority of various other races.

The common class structure of: Lords/Ladies, Common Folk, and Peasantry can be seen in its cities.</p><p>Each city governs its own laws.</p><a href=#arts-culture-and-religion><h2 id=arts-culture-and-religion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arts, Culture, and Religion</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/Religion rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Religion>Religion</a> is the grand motivator of <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>. <a href=/zol/Adrathar-Father-of-the-Wind rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar-Father-of-the-Wind>Adrathar, Father of the Wind</a>&rsquo;s influence is ever present within the kingdom&rsquo;s culture. The main ideals of the kingdom are that of strength, unity, and proving ones self to the kingdoms sole god, <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a>.</p><p>Art and culture revolves heavily on the idea of communal gathering. Traditional dances, great feasts, competitions of strength, storytelling, and music are highly treasured. People will gather in great hall&rsquo;s built to <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a> for these events.</p><p>Many warriors, usually the young, will take on a pilgrimage to venture out into The Storm Isles, called <a href=/zol/The-Enduring rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Enduring>The Enduring</a>. The purpose of this journey is to prove themselves to <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a>. One who takes this challenge is supposed to venture as far north east as they can, braving sea and storm. They are to push and push until their body gives out. Where the body stops, there is said to be a gift from <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a>. This gift may be something simple like a stone or piece of driftwood that will bring their family great prosperity, but some have even found lost magical weapons. Then there are the rare few who are made <a href=/zol/Stormblessed rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormblessed>Stormblessed</a>. These individuals are said to be approached by <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a> himself within a storm and given a gift of power. These gifts manifest as magical abilities of varying power. Some have received great strength or speed, sometimes even wonderous things like flight or the power to control lightning.</p><p><a href=/zol/Stormblessed rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormblessed>Stormblessed</a> are extremely rare and there is usually only one or two per generation. When one is gifted these powers they are accompanied by ever present marks on the body that look like war paint.</p><p>Those who follow in <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a> say he sends the storms to <em>prepare his people for what is to come</em>. This ominous verse is repeated all throughout <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>&rsquo;s culture. Non-believers think this is an engrained doctrine used by <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a> to manipulate his people.</p><p><a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> also disallows the usage of <a href=/zol/Iron-Light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Iron-Light>Iron Light</a>. There are many layers to this dogma, but the followers of <a href=/zol/Adrathar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Adrathar>Adrathar</a> see it as a bastardization of sacred symbols. Usage of <a href=/zol/Apparatum rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Apparatum>Apparatum</a> is a crime within <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>. The runes of the <a href=/zol/Ferric-Alphabet rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Ferric-Alphabet>Ferric Alphabet</a> can instead be seen inscribed decoratively all over weaponry, clothing, art, vessels, and architecture. <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>&rsquo;s culture sees these manifestations of magic as holy, and not for the meddling of mortal hands.</p><a href=#academics-and-magic><h2 id=academics-and-magic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Academics and Magic</h2></a><p>Much education and apprenticeship within <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is conducted via private tutelage. Mentors will either accept payment for their services, or will seek out pupils and offer them teaching. It is a great honor to be offered such a gift and is almost never turned down. <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is not academically gifted compared to much of the other kingdoms, but there are a small handful of academics who are incredibly well accredited.</p><p>There is one academic institution within <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>, <a href=/zol/The-College-of-Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-College-of-Hoss>The College of Hoss</a>.

However it does offer some very unique teachings. The college is a dark any mysterious place located on the very edge of <a href=/zol/The-Three-Corners rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Three-Corners>The Three Corners</a>. It rarely takes on students, and is known to be almost a sister-school to <a href=/zol/The-Kybis-Assembly rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Kybis-Assembly>The Kybis Assembly</a>.</p><a href=#political-climate><h2 id=political-climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Political Climate</h2></a><p>On good terms with its nearby kingdoms, <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> is currently pressured only by its internal struggle between. <a href=/zol/Hoss rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Hoss>Hoss</a> and its rival allied cities of <a href=/zol/Often rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Often>Often</a> and <a href=/zol/Fike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Fike>Fike</a>.</p><a href=#military><h2 id=military><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Military</h2></a><p>The kingdom has a considerably small amount of fighting troops compared to the rest of the world, but it probably has the most capable fighters. Fortunately for <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a> its isolation and storms makes them undesirable for conquest.
