It is a subterranean marvel of carved stone and expertly crafted infrastructure. Located deep in the heart of of the great mountain, <a href=/zol/Kalamdola rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kalamdola>Kalamdola</a>, the city spans three massive caverns within the mountain.</p><p>The city is divided into three main sub-cities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Providence</strong> - The central sub-city of Dwarven Honor. At its entrance lies the Great Stone Door, the main entrance to the city. At the center of Providence lies the beautiful palace of Keep Dranor.

Timber Forge is not directly attached to the city&rsquo;s main entrance, but it is the closest to the surface. This is because of the Raven Tower. A large structure that spans from the cavern&rsquo;s floor to the ceiling, with a large lift in it&rsquo;s center. The Raven Tower serves the purpose of moving resources from the surface down into the city. Most notably timber and agricultural goods.<div class=container><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-/zol/mod_dranor_-_timber_forge.png><label for=zoomCheck-/zol/mod_dranor_-_timber_forge.png><img src=/zol/mod_dranor_-_timber_forge.png width=auto></label></div></p></li></ul><a href=#overview><h2 id=overview><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Overview</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main Opportunity</td><td>The city is ancient, and all throughout its existence <a href=/zol/Dwarves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dwarves>Dwarves</a> have lived and died for its glory. The care and dedication put into their city and culture is so deeply founded it is one of the pivots that the history of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> itself is turned upon. Within the city one can find some of the most skilled craftsmen in all of <a href=/zol/The-Three-Corners rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Three-Corners>The Three Corners</a>, as well as ancient histories and even secrets dating all the way back to <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Main Challenge</td><td><a href=/zol/Dwarves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dwarves>Dwarves</a> are famously stubborn, and a city founded on literal ages of stubbornness is bound to have its problems. While orderly and grand, <a href=/zol/Mod-Dranor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mod-Dranor>Mod Dranor</a> has rivalries between dwarven houses, and even rivalries between sub-cities at times. These conflicts vary in their intensity, but have come to blows in the past.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate</td><td>Subterranean</td></tr><tr><td>Cuisine</td><td>Farmed goods, root vegetable based meals, mushrooms</td></tr><tr><td>Export</td><td>Rare metals, finely crafted goods, <a href=/zol/Mythril rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mythril>Mythril</a></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr><td>Outer Villages</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>City Leader</td><td>King Donnis Gherzeram</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Language(s)</td><td>Dwarven</td></tr><tr><td>Majority Racial Group(s)</td><td><a href=/zol/Dwarves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dwarves>Dwarves</a></td></tr><tr><td>Majority Religion(s)</td><td>Zolaen-Centric, as well as worship of <a href=/zol/Bethar rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Bethar>Bethar</a></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#major-features><h2 id=major-features><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Major Features</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Distinguishing Features</td><td>Subterranean, city separated into multiple caverns</td></tr><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Carved stone, grand arches and bridges, massive structures, emphasis on masonry</td></tr><tr><td>Color(s)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Symbolism</td><td>A pickaxe above an anvil within an arched doorway</td></tr><tr><td>Defenses</td><td>Subterranean, The Great Dwarven Army of Mod Dranor, high quality weaponry and armor</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#people-groups><h2 id=people-groups><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>People Groups</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The Great Houses</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The Dwarven families of the highest reputation. These Dwarves act as the nobility of the city. Unlike the nobility of many other cultures, members of great houses associate with common citizens with a high degree of regularity. Their culture does not put them in a position of power over common citizens like it does in foreign cities. It is more that they are viewed with a greater respect, and they come from a line of very notable dwarves. However it should be said that some individual dwarves do look down on others in this manner, but it is not a significant cultural influence. The heads of these families all sit on The Dwarven Council who aide The King in his duties. The amount of great houses varies over the years, but tends to hover around 10 to 15 families.</td></tr><tr><td>The Common People</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The Vast Majority. These dwarves are the general population of the city. There is a spectrum of economical divide in the city, but it is no where near as wide as what exists in many other cities. Even the least fortunate are able to have standard comforts. The young, sick, and elderly who do not posses a means to an end are taken care of as well. Dwarven pride and honor is extremely important to these people, and will welcome any respectful guest with open arms. This hospitality increases exponentially to any dwarven visitor not originally from <a href=/zol/Mod-Dranor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mod-Dranor>Mod Dranor</a>. There is a common dwarven saying <em>&ldquo;Und Untalsaie&rdquo;</em> which translates to <em>&ldquo;You are home now&rdquo;</em>, a commonly used greeting to dwarves who visit or emigrate to the city.</td></tr><tr><td>Local Elves</td><td>Racial Group</td><td>A small population of local <a href=/zol/Elves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Elves>Elves</a> reside within <a href=/zol/Mod-Dranor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mod-Dranor>Mod Dranor</a>. They are allowed homes within the city by laws written into <a href=/zol/The-Elven-Dwarven-Concord rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Elven-Dwarven-Concord>The Elven-Dwarven Concord</a>. Many reside here as political ambassadors, or as craftsmen with specific interests in the practices of <a href=/zol/Dwarves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dwarves>Dwarves</a>. These individuals are however, not allowed in Watcher&rsquo;s Crest.</td></tr><tr><td>Local Non-Dwarves and Non-Elves</td><td>Racial Group</td><td>The very small population of locals who reside in the city that are not <a href=/zol/Dwarves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Dwarves>Dwarves</a> or <a href=/zol/Elves rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Elves>Elves</a>. To gain this sort of citizenship in <a href=/zol/Mod-Dranor rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mod-Dranor>Mod Dranor</a> is extremely difficult, unless you have a dwarven spouse. It requires direct permission from the Dwarven Council. These individuals are however, not allowed in Watcher&rsquo;s Crest.</td></tr><tr><td>Slaves</td><td>Social Class</td><td>Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. Slaves typically reside in farming or lumber camps above Timber Forge. Made up mostly of captured thieves and bandits. Dwarves are not allowed to be made into slaves. There are a small group of slaves who serve families within the city, and are treated considerably well for slave standards across <a href=/zol/The-Three-Corners rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Three-Corners>The Three Corners</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Citizens of Providence</td><td>Local Sub-Culture</td><td>Dwarves known for being a little-self important. Whenever the city as a whole faces hardship, providence usually ensures it is the best taken care of as it is the &lsquo;city-center&rsquo;.</td></tr><tr><td>Citizens of Timber Forge</td><td>Local Sub-Culture</td><td>Dwarves know for leading a &lsquo;slow-life&rsquo;. Farmers, lumber workers, hunters, and craftspersons. Hard workers that those of the political center, and deeper mining operations view as their own local version of the <a href=/zol/Halflings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Halflings>Halflings</a> from <a href=/zol/Woogis rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Woogis>Woogis</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Citizens of Watcher&rsquo;s Crest</td><td>Local Sub-Culture</td><td>Those of the <a href=/zol/Mythril rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mythril>Mythril</a> sub-city are typically seen as religious fanatics, or gruff miners. The stereotype of a person from Watcher&rsquo;s Crest is either a white robed cleric, or a dirt-covered miner.</td></tr><tr><td>House Gherzeram</td><td>Great House</td><td>The great house of The Kings family, known for ruling Mod Dranor for many generations. The houses head is King Donnis Gherzeram himself.</td></tr><tr><td>House Mireen</td><td>Great House</td><td>The house of trade. House Mireen manages much of the export and import of most things <a href=/zol/The-Iron-Tracks rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Iron-Tracks>The Iron Tracks</a> bring to and from the city. Headed by Lady Larza Mireen.</td></tr><tr><td>House Jhalseeze</td><td>Great House</td><td>The house of gold. House Jhalseeze is responsible for the city&rsquo;s treasury and taxes. Headed by Lord Verif Jhalseeze.</td></tr><tr><td>House Rocboddim</td><td>Great House</td><td>The house of mining. House Rocboddim is responsible for all infrastructure and planning that is involved with mining. Headed by Lord Cable Rocboddim, the house also has a reputation for being at the center of a lot of dramatics and gossip.</td></tr><tr><td>House Torbil</td><td>Great House</td><td>The house of arms. House Torbil is responsible for the cities fearsome military. Headed by the fierce Lady Yelena Torbil.</td></tr><tr><td>House Carszes</td><td>Great House</td><td>The famed house of master smiths. House Carszes does not bear the same level of responsibility like some other houses. They are instead known by the high number of skilled smiths that have come from their family line.</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#goods-and-services><h2 id=goods-and-services><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Goods and Services</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Location</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Keep Dranor</td><td>Keep</td><td>Providence</td><td>The city&rsquo;s main keep, a massive palace carved from the stone of the mountain</td></tr><tr><td>The Great Stone Door</td><td>Misc.</td><td>Providence</td><td>The main entrance to the subterranean city.
