A terrible product of the vast power differences that exist in <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a></em><div class=container><input type=checkbox id="zoomCheck-/zol/mask of iron.png"><label for="zoomCheck-/zol/mask of iron.png"><img src="/zol/mask of iron.png" width=auto></label></div></p><p>Slavery is a dark stain on <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s history and society. It was first spawned shortly after <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>. Many of those who made early grabs at power implemented the practice as an unjust way to accelerate their ascension. By enslaving their enemies, criminals, and others they had a negative perception of, they were able to accomplish feats of civilization and conquest that would have been otherwise unattainable. However, the free labor they had invested in had other grave costs that were paid in blood.</p><p>Slaves were known to rebel and kill their masters regularly. In a world where power can be drawn from <a href=/zol/The-Trinity rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Trinity>The Trinity</a> by even the most oppressed mind, the concept of owning another is a sure way to secure a dark fate. However this did not stop the greedy powers of the world. A constant, distributed war between slaves and slavers has been waged all across <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>, and all throughout its history. The most notable events of it being the <a href=/zol/Alderian-Rebellion rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Alderian-Rebellion>Alderian Rebellion</a> and the <a href=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Triumvirate-Battles>Triumvirate Battles</a>.</p><p>Slowly but surely, those oppressed have been gaining ground on those who would control them. The most horrible of practices conducted by those in power have lessened more and more, as it has always pushed slaves to violence. Slaves now receive a sort of <em>expected</em> treatment which is considerably less horrible than the slaves who had suffered long ago. This sadly does not mean they lead pleasant lives. Those in power know pushing them to their limit is extremely dangerous, and instead attempt to walk the line. It also helps that public opinion, especially in the east, has changed in favor of the slaves. Many slaves serve a long sentence, rather than being permanently kept at the status. This makes it so they see the light at the end of the tunnel, and undisruptive slaves reach the light sooner. This horrible, manipulative practice structures the current landscape of slavery.</p><p>The status and behavior of slaves is denoted by the mask they wear. All slaves wear one of the following masks:</p><ul><li><strong>Mask of Wood</strong> - A common worker slave. These individuals work in lumber yards, mines, shipping yards, and things of the like. Known to keep their head down, and serve out their sentence. These slaves are often nicknamed <em>Splints</em>. Which is a shortening of their older nickname <em>Splinters</em>, in reference to their wooden masks.</li><li><strong>Mask of Porcelain</strong> - A servant of the upper class. These individuals act similarly as paid help, and are often associated with good behavior. Their masks are often designed to look stylish, and most often do not cover the whole face. Some slaves of this status are treated considerably well, and sometimes even become beloved members of the houses they work at. It is seen as a mercy on the surface, but when looking at it more closely one can see the dark horrible manipulations beneath its shallow surface. These slaves are often called <em>Doll Masks</em> or <em>Chips</em>, based on the wear and tear their delicate masks receive.</li><li><strong>Mask of Iron</strong> - Dangerous slaves. Those who have exhibited violence during their time behind a mask of wood or porcelain. These slaves are very rare, as the actions that would earn one a mask of iron usually result in imprisonment or execution. However sometimes the slave posses a useful trait, or they receive this as a sick punishment. These slaves are often given the most dangerous, and grueling jobs. This group is usually called <em>Iron Masks</em> or <em>Blood Masks</em>.</li></ul><p><em>Slavery is included in <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> as an injustice for the characters to overcome. I, as the author feel strongly about the injustice of forcing another person to do something against their will, and/or taking away their freedoms. Any instance of slavery in a story within <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> is meant as an obstacle for the heroes to overcome. Any character who owns, or perpetuates <a href=/zol/Slavery rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Slavery>Slavery</a> is meant to be seen as an antagonist. There are no exceptions. No inclusion of slavery is meant to reflect real world events, or peoples and their experiences. One also does not need to include this concept to tell a story within this world if they do not wish to. For further explanation of the inclusion of such a dark concept in the world, I encourage you to read the <a href=/zol/Disclaimer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Disclaimer>Disclaimer</a>.</em></p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jakeabetes.github.io/zol/js/graph.ea8f7f52d8e39ec9721ab624b31d341f.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacob Turner using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2024</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
