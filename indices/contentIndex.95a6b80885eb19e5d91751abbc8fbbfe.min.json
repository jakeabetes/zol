However at the core of the narrative lies a common thread: [[Aasimar]] are said to be beings who have had some divine influence in their birth. This may be due to the will of a god, or due to a parents copulation with a divine entity. The former is considered to be more far-fetched, but the narrative exists in many myths and legends.\n\n[[Aasimar]] appear as ordinary members of one of [[Zol]]'s [[Races]], however they hold a great power within them.

He is a very controversial figure in [[Zol]] as he is seen as both an ideal hero, and an insighter of rebellion. To stand ever-strong against oppression is the only sure way to hold back growing darkness.\n\n## Depiction\nA Cockatiel [[Aarakocra]]-like being with only his single left arm, and a lightning bolt pattern on the right side of his face. Typically depicted holding a sword that resembles a feather and bearing golden armor. \n\n## Moral\n[[Abaddon]] teaches the moral of Courage. It is one of the most simple morals, but one of the most difficult to stay true to. Courage is not only the ability to stand against fear and oppression, but the knowledge to know *when* to resist the instinct to run or give in.\n\n## Associations\n[[Abaddon]] is associated with:\n- [[Aarakocra]]\n- Flight and [[Airships]]\n- Rebellion\n\t- notably playing a role in the beliefs of many rebels during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]\n\n## Realm\n[[Abaddon]]'s domain within [[The Unknown Realm]] is a large fortress within the branches of a colossal tree.

The surrounding kingdoms were oblivious to its existence. This was only until the mid [[First Age]] when some curious pirates noticed light beneath the waves, and dove down to discover a whole city of Triton. \n\nThe discovery of such a magical place is a wonderous thing, however no one initially benefited from [[Abdjadan]]'s discovery. [[Abdjadan]] immediately took to attacking any outsiders that approached, and the surrounding kingdoms were not happy to learn they had a potential enemy beneath the surface of [[The Archsea]]. \n\nThis tension only lasted about a hundred years, and some curious members of both surface and deep sea society began to try and explore each other's worlds again. Eventually, envoys from both worlds were able to cross over, but [[Abdjadan]] decided to remain disconnected. Triton who have entered surface society are the descendants of these envoys. What little is known about their society came from these few interactions, and the discoveries about the underwater city made by the surface only continue to prove more mysterious, strange, and even disturbing at times. \n\n![[abdjadan.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Abdjadan is an extremely well ordered city. Its citizens are devout followers of [[Ohlit]]. There is little problem with disorder and crime isn't a factor in the city's daily life. The city appears as a thoroughly planned out, and complete machine that serves [[Ohlit]]'s will. |\n| Main Challenge | The few who have been fortunate enough to enter [[Abdjadan]] claim that the city has a feeling of vacancy. It feels as if something within it is missing. Society is well ordered, but its people do not have the freedom to explore life beyond the city. This all stems from the well guarded site at the city's center. By the best guess of scholars, [[Abdjadan]] was built at [[Ohlit]]'s will overtop the most shallow fissure to [[The Void]]. Beneath the district of Saraxan lies a sea cave, called The Jaert'n Breach that is fortified by the vast majority of the city's forces. Here, warriors of the city fight of dark creatures who try and climb their way out of [[The Void]] |\n| Climate | Undersea |\n| Cuisine | Fish, sea vegetation |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Small |\n| Outer Villages| None |\n| City Leader | Queen Piton Amashal |\n| Primary Language(s) | Triton |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | [[Triton]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Followers of [[Ohlit]] |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Underwater City |\n| Architecture | Radially symmetric buildings, strings of round lanterns, glass domes filled with air |\n| Color(s) | None |\n| Symbolism | None |\n| Defenses | Army of [[Abdjadan]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group             | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Those of The Ring | Social Class | The city's royalty, or nobility.

Especially those who defend The Breach.                             |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is ruled by Queen Piton Amashal, a young Triton woman who has recently inherited the throne due to the unfortunate passing of their father, a previous beloved ruler. Queen Amashal is an ambitious but na√Øve ruler, and seeks to open channels of communication with the surface. This has created discourse amongst the city's people. However the first and foremost mandate is still upheld by the city: defend The Jaert'n Breach. This requires that nothing comes through the breach, and no one comes to tamper with it from [[The Prime]]. \n\n### Laws\nThe city does not have formal law because of its well ordered people, however the local authority would surely respond to anything most other kingdoms consider a crime.\n\nThe city also does not allow outsiders.\n\n## Modern Importance\nThe city holds little modern importance, but is commonly mentioned in stories and rumor. Particularly those of sailors.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city has little historical importance. The most notable thing about it is how long it kept itself hidden before it was discovered by surface dwellers.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Some believe that the city holds a great treasure, making it a common place of interest for pirates. This is based largely on the information the surface worlds knows about its currency.\n\t- The city does use currency, but exclusively gold coin. The conversion rates here are also not in favor of surface dwellers. A simple meal would cost 15 gold coins.\n- Beyond treasure, the city does contain a unique resource. The Jaert'n Breach emits unique magical energy, which draws in very unique sea life. The most consequential of which, is Riftshells. A cast of mollusks which feed off of microbes who thrive in the environment near rifts to [[The Void]]. Their shells are comprised of a unique material that is called Nacrem. When crushed, Nacrem combusts violently. It releases a great deal of air, light and heat. Some Riftshells hold very rare stone called Riftpearls. These pearls are extremely useful for artificers who wish to craft lasers, and transdimensional tools.\n\t- The people of [[Abdjadan]] utilize Nacrem reactions for many things such as illumination, heating, forging, and filling underwater spaces with air to be used as various types of infrastructure like temples, meeting places, restaurants, and spaces in which tools are created or used.\n\t- Nacrem and Riftpearls are very rare outside of [[Abdjadan]]. Many artificers on the surface would pay a great deal for these resources.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Absurdia":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Absurdia\"\n---*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nArguably the weirdest place in all of [[Zol]]. Many believe it is not even a real place, other's think it is the manifestation of some strange magic, or the will of a mischievous god.[[Absurdia]] exists as an almost *parody* of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is unknown exactly what made [[Absurdia]], which only deepens the strangeness of the realm.\n\n![[Absurdia 1.png]]\n\n[[Absurdia]] is filled with whacky cities and strange individuals. The population native to [[Absurdia]] are known as the Absurd. They all seem to have an air about them that makes them feel like characters from a book.\n\nQuests, squabbles, feuds, parties, monster attacks, festivals, battles, and prophecies emerge on the daily within the odd realm. To the locals, the constant bombardment of events is entirely normal and no one seems to tire of it.\n\n[[Absurdia]] seems to contain many cities, all of which have very strange names like *Yorfinshire*, *Boogsley*, or *Gumpins*. Each city seems to have a stark rivalry with all other cities. It is not known how many cities exist, or how large the plane is. Many travel to [[Absurdia]] to see its strange wonders, and some even make a home there. \n\nThe few stories and texts that exist about it tell of wonderful adventures, and strange characters. However there does seem to be something *wrong* with the plane, a strange darkness that lies at its center which none of its residents will acknowledge.\n\n## Death in Absurdia\n[[Absurdia]] is not on [[The Mortal Coil]]. When a being native to [[Absurdia]] dies, they occasionally reappear after a short period of time that can be as short as one hour, or maybe as long as two weeks. When they return, they have no memory of their death, or the events leading up to it. To the Absurd, it is considered impolite to talk about the fact someone has died to their face. \n\nIf one is not native to [[Absurdia]], they are usually banished from the plane and sent to some random location on another plane. The few records of this tell of individuals being sent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], but there has been records of people ending up as far as [[The Moons]]. Due to its chaotic nature, death in [[Absurdia]] not  uncommon.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Adrathar":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Adrathar\"\n---See [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Adrathar-Father-of-the-Wind":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Adrathar, Father of the Wind\"\n---*Wayward God of Storms, Major Deity*\n![[adrathar storm.png]]\n\nHe who weaves the wind, demands of the rain, and commands the lightning.

It involves the deconstruction and combination of substances in a scientific processes to create products that are greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThese creations may be medicine, dyes, inks, metals, cures, waxes, adhesives, solvents, acids, bases, beverages, cements, psychoactives, [[Pneumoactives]], potions, and poisons.\n\n## Mechanism of Alchemy\nAlchemy operates using what are called *Principals*. Principals are, in essence, the abstract pieces of a substance which emits the substance's Informational [[Energy]]. That is to say, they are the smallest, distinct arrangements of [[Nodes]] within a substance other than [[Nodes]] themselves. To break a principal down further, would just result in individual [[Nodes]].\n\nPrincipals are extremely unique in the fact that they exhibit a single magical trait based on what principal they are. Principals are extracted by exposing a substance to specific chemicals and magical processes. This breaks the substance down into what are called *Unbound Principals*. Unbound Principals seek to bind themselves to anything they can. Upon binding to another substance, the resulting product will be a new substance. However, not all reactions are favorable, and the vast majority are not useful or dangerous.\n\nThis is because the likely create something volatile, or the inert substance *Phlogiston*. Phlogiston (sometimes called Anti-Material), is the product of any reaction which causes loss. For example, when a log burns the material products are charcoal, ash, and a handful of various gases. However, there is also a great unaccounted for loss of material. This is because a great deal of the material is converted to Phlogiston. Phlogiston is wholly unreactive. As a solid, it appears as a very dark glass-like stone. As a liquid, it appears as very clear water. As a gas it is entirely invisible, but has a distinct sharp, fresh smell. The empty space within [[The Cosmos]] is actually very saturated with Phlogiston.\n\nTo avoid this, alchemists will add their refined principals to substances which won't react with the given principal. An alchemist's goal is to combine principals with other principals and substances to create something new and useful.\n\n## Examples of Principals\nThere are said to be an infinite amount of potential principals, any many are constantly being discovered. Every object is made up of a finite, but large number of principals. What follows is a list of various famed principals:\n- Fire\n- Water\n- Mass\n- Reflectiveness\n- Toxicity\n- Flexibility\n- Remembrance\n- Wine\n- Wake\n- Sleep\n- Protection\n- Vegetation\n- Age\n- Salt\n- Structure\n- Death\n- Purity\n- Cess\n- Healing\n- Memory\n- Strength\n- Concentration\n- Love\n- Digestion\n- Psychic Potential\n- Courage\n- Banishment\n- Flesh\n- Blood\n- Positivity\n- Negativity\n- Passion\n- Chaos\n- Attraction\n- Perpetuity\n- Spirituality\n- Renewal\n- Exorcism\n- Focus\n- Weather\n- Abundance\n- Soothing\n- Explosivity\n- Remedy\n\n## Similarities between Principals and Iron Light's Ferric Alphabet\nAcademics and Philosophers have sought a connection between [[Iron Light]]'s [[Ferric Alphabet]] and Principals since the discovery of the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. However a clear connection has not been found. The Majority believe that there is no *direct* correlation between the two, but rather the two sciences lead the the same end location; a set of low-level magical concepts used to control [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].\n\n## Grand Alchemy\nGrand Alchemy is a term used within alchemy to describe the creation of substances so potent that their effects are permanent.

Despite the losses, it was the first time rebels had taken a city in [[Kapesh]]. Rumors spread quickly, and another rebellion was sparked in [[Hanen]]. After much fighting, and aid from rebels in [[Ka'thoor]], [[Hanen]] was taken as well.\n\nHuman nobility were executed, but the lower class human population was largely spared by Eirmond's mercy. These individuals were given a choice, aid the rebellion or face exile. Many resisted and some chose exile, but a sizeable group decided to stay and fight alongside rebels.\n\n[[Deepspell]] was the next strategic foothold to take, it was a difficult city to seize, especially with the aid of [[Kerketh Academy]] and their mages. It is likely the city never would have fallen, if not for a group of open minded students led by Alex Laro-Rissan, a charismatic noblemen's son who began a movement to stop the mages of the academy from fighting the rebels. Some say it was an act of honor, while others believe it was done in defiance of his parentage. Eventually it broke out into infighting within the academy. Ultimately rebels prevailed and the border between north and south [[Kapesh]] was secured.\n\nIt was at this time, the city of [[Holocene]] surrendered without prompt. The city and their nobles were kept safe and it became one of the rebels cities. This annexed the southern half of the region off from north [[Kapesh]].\n\n[[Rails]] and [[Zessgorn]] were taken soon after. [[Zessgorn]] notably by a group of slaves already within the city. This only left [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, this was when [[Kapesh]] began making headway with their counter-attack. [[Ka'thoor]] was retaken, and the human forces then moved on to [[Hanen]].\n\nRemarkably, [[Hanen]] held out against 3 major attacks by [[Kapesh]] with no support, and almost no resources. This one in a million chance forced [[Kapesh]] to retreat to [[Ka'thoor]]. They were ambushed by the forces of [[Holocene]] during this retreat, and [[Hanen]] was secured once again.\n\nThe rebels eventually retook [[Ka'thoor]], and all attention was turned on [[Tenzentak]]. The city's rough outskirts and defensible position made it for a long drawn out battle. It wasn't until a well trained group of [[Tabaxi]] rebels scaled the edge of the cliffs that overlook [[The Grand Nothing]] in great numbers and broke the outer walls defenses from the inside. In this victory the rebels took south [[Kapesh]] in its entirety. \n\n## The Founding of The Free Cities of Alderun\nAfter [[Tenzentak]] was taken by rebels, [[Kapesh]] attempted to retake [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Deepspell]], but were unsuccessful. The region was in a state of chaos, but had a hopeful air to it.\n\nEirmond and representatives from the cities met in [[Rails]] to establish a new government. The [[Alderian Council]] was formed for this purpose. A group of representatives, one from each of the cities, to serve the purpose of maintaining each city, and upholding the laws and values. The region was renamed [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Alderun meaning *hope* in Orcish.\n\n[[Kapesh]] did not recognize them as a kingdom for many years, but eventually caved to political and military pressures.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Alderian-Seat":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Alderian Seat\"\n---See [[Alderian Council]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Anticities":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Anticities\"\n---[[Anticities]] are type of settlement defined by academics.

These devices can be quite simple or very complex. Their value scales with complexity, and distance from locations where their production is common place (ex: [[Deepspell]]).\n\n## Common Apparatum\n\n| Name | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Span Read | A set of 2 devices, each with a writing surface and an arm to support a writing utensil. Individuals can send messages over a great distance by writing on one surface, causing its counterpart to automatically make the same movements. It is crucial both implements are level so movements are transmitted accurately. This means that span reads do not operate well in the sea or sky unless gyroscopic mechanisms are included in their design. Devices are connected to each other via signets. Simple span reads have a single hard-set partner signet, while the more intricate ones have swappable signets or ones that can be configured to fit the user's needs. Many who utilize span reads will do so through a third party operator (usually a business) that will ensure their message reaches the intended target, assuming their recipient is included within their extensive archives of contacts.|\n| Iceless | A sealed box with an iron rod that moves heat along it from the inside of the box to the outside to preserve foods within. A heatsink attached to the outside of the box is connected to a mechanism that requires regular winding (usually daily) to properly distribute heat. The device also requires an operator be near by bearing a corresponding signet ring.|\n| Light Lock | A magical lock that only works with specific individual keys rather than any key that fits the correct pattern. Making forced entry very difficult. |\n| Illusion Lamp | A magical lamp that utilizes illusion light. Eliminates the need for fuel and fire hazards. Requires a being possessing [[Vizir]] to be within a relatively small range (around 100ft) for operation. |\n| Ever-sharp Steel | Blade edges that resist becoming dull. |\n| Ever-hard Steel | Metal that can withstand more damage than it should be able to. |\n| Burn Filter | A small devices that evaporates water and reconsolidates it into filtered, drinkable water. These devices are known to have short lifespans. They are cheap to produce in a disposable manner, and especially hard to produce a lasting version|\n| Vizir Alarm | A device that makes sounds when a being with a [[Vizir]] enters within its small radius |\n| Iron Lighter | A device that produces a small temporary flame without the need of an internal fuel source |\n| Twinned Bells | A set of small bells that all toll when any of the set are rung |\n| Chronomantic Clock | A time telling device that leverages the simplest properties of [[Chronomancy]] for its function. |\n| Compass | A device that can be programmed to point north, or at a specific point in space given the device was originally activated at that location. |\n\n## Complex Apparatum\n\n| Name | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Sending Stone | Devices that have the capability of transmitting voice messages to other sending stones over great distances. Operating similarly to Span Reads, but transmitting sound rather than pen strokes. These devices also require signets in their implementation. |\n| Holdings | Containers that are larger on the inside than the outside, allowing for great storage |\n| Automail | Prosthetic limbs that give sense of touch, and sometimes abilities greater than that of its biological counterpart |\n| [[Warforged]] | A race of beings formed from [[Iron Light]]. These individuals can be made to very specific specifications to excel at specific tasks. In modern day, these individuals are constructed to be servile. |\n| Archival Index | A terminal device that can be used to index information within a library for easy retrieval. These devices are extremely expensive, and difficult to up-keep. Less than 15 are used across [[The Three Corners]]. |\n| Spacial Engines | Devices that can convert empty space into motion. The method of motion used in [[Trains]] and [[Airships]]. These devices are known to create extremely low temperatures so they typically use coal heat to prevent ice crystals (which could damage the ferric runes) from forming. |\n| Mass Reducers | Devices that are integrated into the whole of greater Apparatum to reduce their overall mass. Used in [[Airships]]. |\n| Firearms | A classification of projectile weaponry that leverages [[Iron Light]] for destructive capabilities. These devices can launch many types of ammunition depending on how they are made. In most hands these are far more efficient than bows or crossbows, but are expensive to acquire and maintain. In modern times a non-magical equivalent that uses black powder has been used widely, but these are not nearly as effective as Iron Light Guns. |","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Arcanists":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Arcanists\"\n---[[Caster]]s who utilize the will of [[Arcana]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Arcanum":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Arcanum\"\n---One third of [[The University]].

It is based in the firmly held belief that [[Zol]], and [[The Trinity]] by extension were created by [[The Watcher in The Door]] through [[The First Tongue]]. It views the [[Zolaen Gods]] as absolute in their power, and that all other forms of divinity are not truly holy.\n\nIt also views ancient people as sinful, most notably [[Humans]]. This sin is largely based around the idea that ancient people caused [[The Undoing]]. The defining characteristic of [[Arkian]] belief compared to other Zolaen-Centric belief is that the people of [[Zol]] are guilty of crimes so great and horrible, that the [[Zolaen Gods]] had to destroy the old world and birth it anew. Its scripture says the people of [[Zol]] must pay penance for the sins of their ancestors. It is why so much was lost, and why modern life is so dangerous and challenging. Only through overcoming the challenges of [[Zol]], and following [[The Watcher]]'s guidance can one find forgiveness. \n\n## Values\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The Trinity]] as an extension of [[The Watcher]]'s power\n- Atonement\n- Overcoming adversity\n- Purity\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[The Watcher]]\n\t- [[The Night Empress]]\n\t- [[The Lifeweaver]]\n\t- [[Yanneran]]\n\t- [[Tellab, the Wise]]\n\t- [[Giriam]]\n\t- [[Ayamot]]\n\t- [[Ohlit]]\n- Lesser [[Gods]] allied to the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[Bethar]]\n\t- [[Ellyon and Aradon]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Arkian]] scripture tells of [[The Watcher]] defeating [[Goh'zul]], then speaking [[The First Tongue]]. [[Arkian]] belief states that by speaking it in that moment, [[The Watcher]] created [[The First Tongue]]. Though this power he bound the other [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[The Trinity]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Arkian]] scripture teaches that ancient society was advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Arkian]] belief dictates that the [[Zolaen Gods]] enacted [[The Undoing]] as punishment to the people of [[Zol]] for heinous crimes.\n\n## Church Structure\n[[Arkian]] churches can manifest in one of two ways. The first being places of worship which are structured to worship all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] as a whole. These are called Octainiaries, after the eight gods. The second are places of worship structured to follow a specific member of the [[Zolaen Gods]], called Moniaries. The latter still pay respect to the pantheon as a whole, but they focus on the specific teachings and domain of a singular god.\n\nChurches may form as an individual organization, but often they are part of a larger collection of churches. Most commonly this is limited to the scope of a whole city, but sometimes they exceed that boundary.\n\nChurches are headed either an **Octavian Priest**, or a **Monian Priest** based on the type of church. Churches with a wider network are headed by **Zoltrum Octavian**, or a **Zoltrum Monian**. Beneath an Octavian or Monian Priest there are usually **High Priests**, and **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and being forgiven through devout worship to the [[Zolaen Gods]]. To a modernist, forgiveness is something that is easily obtained from [[The Watcher]] if it is sought out with honesty and humility. However, forgiveness is not held in perpetuity. One must live as a servant to the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief is similar to modernist belief in the sense that it focuses on the idea of inherited sin. However, fundamentalist belief tends to view the sin as far more abhorrent. Fundamentalists see themselves as pure, and above the \"scum\" of those who are sinful.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n[[Arkian]] worship is extremely widespread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]]. Most notably in the eastern kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n## Other Information\n- The specific nature of the crimes committed by the final generations of ancient peoples are not known. [[Arkian]] scripture mentions things like fraternizing with [[Gods]] other than the [[Zolaen Gods]], fraternizing with dark forces, attempting to surpass the [[Zolaen Gods]], and other things of similar heretical nature.\n- Sin is a widely debated topic within the scope of [[Arkian]] scripture. Though it it mostly associated with criminal activity, poor care of ones self/home/city, violence (that is unapproved by the church), wrath, promiscuity, over-indulgence, fraternization with [[Gods]] not approved by [[Arkian]] scripture, and things of the like. \n- [[Arkian]] worship is very similar to [[Dorian]] worship, however they differ in the sense that [[Arkian]] belief focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and atonement. [[Arkian]] belief sees the modern world as an opportunity for atonement. [[Dorian]] belief instead focuses on the idea of the modern world being a second chance at life. The two churches were once a single denomination, but diverged long ago. This divergence occurred before razing events like the [[Beast Ire]] Plague, and possibly even [[The Dragon War]]. The true nature of this divergence has been lost to time, and is largely debated.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Artificers":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Artificers\"\n---Magical crafters who bend the fundamental powers of [[Zol]] into their own creations. The creations can take many forms but largely fall into the four categories of Engineering, [[Alchemy]], [[Iron Light]], and [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].\n\nArtificers will use their creations to give themselves, or another, means beyond what they would normally be able to accomplish. This creation may manifest as a tool, pharmaceutical,  transportation, weapon, or defense.\n\nThe typical forms of artificary are:\n- Engineering - utilizing craftsmanship, natural materials, and mathematics to create technology.\n- [[Alchemy]] - utilizing magical and scientific techniques to break down, and re-combine substances to create something greater than the sum of their parts.\n- [[Iron Light]] - the most common craft. Iron utilizes simple runes formed into complex designs to leverage a user's [[Vizir]].\n- [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] - the most complicated and powerful form of artificary. It involves permanently imbuing an object with magic far beyond the power of [[Iron Light]]\nThese methods are frequently used together for superior results, but the resulting component is usually identified by the most difficult aspect of its making.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Ashian":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ashian\"\n---*In his hands he held the gift of three fires. Each with the power to raze the Void, and ignite the world anew*\n![[Ashian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Ashian]] is a Trinity-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]], most notably [[Kapesh]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that all things, even the [[Gods]], are only allowed to exist through [[The Trinity]]. It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god. It also deifies [[Wordbearers]] as small [[Gods]].\n\nThe [[Ashian]] denomination is known for its worship of [[The Word of Fire]]. It is named after those who witnessed the snapping of [[The Word of Fire]], ash covered priests who witnessed the [[Wordbearer]] discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. The religion originally stemmed from [[Trinaism]]. Though through its close connection to [[The Word of Fire]], the denomination transformed rapidly, and broke off of [[Trinaism]].\n\n## Values\n- Sacrifice\n- Hierarchy\n- The Kingdom of [[Kapesh]]\n- [[Galliard Crown]]\n- [[Wordbearers]]\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- Fire\n- Order\n- Rebirth\n- Excellence\n- [[The Wills]]\n- [[Magic]]\n- Fate/Destiny\n- Prophecy\n- Divinity of the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[The Old Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n- [[Humans]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Trinity]]\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Ashian]] scripture believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[Ashian]] scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]], allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Ashian]] scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Ashian]] scripture views [[Humans]] as a sacrifice in the context of [[The Undoing]]. [[Ashian]] belief says that [[Humans]] fought alongside the [[Zolaen Gods]] against [[The Shroud of the Void]]. In the later stages of the battle, [[The Shroud of the Void]] began to take over the minds of [[Humans]]. So the [[Humans]] willingly gave up their [[Great Magic]], giving the [[Zolaen Gods]] the upper hand to seal the [[Void Gods]] away permanently within [[The Void]]. However, this was at a great cost. In an attempt to evade imprisonment, [[The Shroud of the Void]] used all of the power it had stolen from the [[Humans]] in an attempt to destroy [[The Watcher]]. [[The Shroud]] was unsuccessful in killing [[The Watcher]], but his destruction still caused [[The Undoing]].\n\n## Church Structure\nSimilar to [[Trinaism]], the [[Ashian]] church has a strict adherence to the idea of hierarchy. However, unlike [[Trinaism]], [[Ashian]] worship is not segmented into many smaller churches across [[The Three Corners]]. Instead, The [[Ashian]] church is a single organization, The [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\nAt the churches head exist two individuals. [[The Word of Fire]], and **The Grand Conflagrator**. [[The Word of Fire]] holds a unique role within the church. This is because he is seen as a piece of divinity himself. [[The Word of Fire]] does not lead the church in teachings, but instead exists as a messiah. [[The Word of Fire]] is seen as a royal, holy protector and a source of wisdom. [[The Word of Fire]] appoints a Grand Conflagrator. The Grand Conflagrator leads the whole of the [[Church of Three Fires]] in religious matters. The Grand Conflagrator is responsible for directing the teachings of the church, maintaining hierarchy, and resolving issues of faith.\n\nThe Grand Conflagrator leads the headquarters of the organization, The Cathedral of Three Fires in [[Stigmata]]. Beneath The Grand Conflagrator are **High Conflagrators** and **Conflagrators**. Individuals of these ranks are permitted to oversee churches of their own. Beneath them are **High Priests** and **Priests**.\n\nThe church also sees the [[Galliard Crown]], and the kingdom of [[Kapesh]] as holy.\n\n### Notable Organizations\n- The [[Church of Three Fires]]\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on worship and reverence of [[The Trinity]], [[The Wills]], [[The Word of Fire]], [[Galliard Crown]], and [[Kapesh]] as a whole. It views [[Humans]] as the brave sacrifice which saved the world from total antihalation. It is thought that only [[Humans]] can only restore their [[Great Magic]] through the church's wisdom. It also holds the belief that all things are intended, and that [[The Trinity]] will see [[Zol]] reach an age of glory once again, so long as its followers stay true.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief focuses on the ideals of sacrifice, hierarchy, and Human Sovereignty. It has a reputation of being the most brutal Trinity-Centric belief system within [[The Three Corners]]. Fundamentalist [[Arkian]] belief is is known for supporting one-sided societal structures like high nobility and [[Slavery]]. \n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[Stigmata]]\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Ashian]] belief supports [[Great Magic]] and the [[Triumvirate]].\n- [[Ashian]] belief is similar in many ways to Zolaen-Centric belief.

He spilled his own blood into the lakes and rivers of [[Zol]]. Those who drank of the waters were granted whispers of power, and strange dreams.\n\nSome did not notice, or even undergo the effects. Those who did felt a strong urge to follow their new bestial instincts, and abandon their societal bonds. It manifested as pulling sensation to the wilderness. Those who gave in abandoned their old lives to seek the source of this yearning.\n\nThey lived like primal people: hunting, scavenging, and howling under moonlight. The more they gave in, the more they grew in their strength. Bestial blood began to fill their veins. It increased their physical abilities, senses, and furthered the odd dreams.\n\n[[Kerndall]] meant for these people to be a legion of strong beings, true to his ways. By his ideals, they could defend themselves with no need for society and laws. Directly experiencing the wonder of nature day in, and day out.\n\nFor a time it was a sort of paradise for these people. The towns and cities they abandoned were left in shock and fear for their vanished loved ones, but it only created mass panic, rather than full blown pandemonium. Though it was not long before the habits of mortals began to reemerge in these bestial peoples.\n\nSome of the changed individuals sought more than the life of a simple beast, they hunted larger and larger prey. Eventually they began hunting each other, consuming them, and gaining much more of [[Kerndall]]'s essence through biomagnification. Their greed began to drive the transformation down a dark path. Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city's outskirts.\n\nEventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name [[Bloodhunters]], and the hunted were called [[Beastmen]]. The affliction itself was dubbed [[Beast Ire]].\n\nThe [[Beastmen]] were extremely powerful, and their minds had devolved to madness. It took warriors of equal strength and great determination to slay them. Many warriors began consuming small doses of blood from slain [[Beastmen]] to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over-usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of [[Beast Ire]].\n\nThe affliction was furthered by thralls of powerful [[Beastmen]]. Their power had grown so great, they could overpower the wills of weak mortals, and turn them into beast-like monstrosities that were loyal to them. The thrall's affliction was a strangely contagious thing and it spread quickly as viscous plague. \n\nThe exact method of transference was never determined, but over-exposure to beings that bore the affliction would occasionally cause individuals to succumb to the sickness. Bites and scratches from [[Beastmen]] seemed to accelerate this, however merely being in proximity to them for too long could cause it. The weaker one's will was, the more likely they would fall victim to the disease. Eventually the condition mutated enough to affect regular beasts as well. [[Bloodhunters]] that fought well seemed largely resistant to the transformation, however they were plagued by maddening thoughts. Academics debated about it being some bloodborne or airborne pathogen. Other's believed the method of transference was magical in nature.\n\n[[Bloodhunters]] who were interviewed by academics spoke of eldritch, nigh incomprehensible knowledge being revealed to them in dreams and visions. However they couldn't put the concepts to words efficiently. This sparked small academic branches, and churches who were obsessed with prospects of beast blood.\n\n[[Kerndall]] sought to stop the affliction, but it had taken on a life of its own. [[Zol]] was tainted by the plague, and the conflict between mortals and [[Beastmen]] had turned [[The Prime]] into a nightmarish world since [[Beast Ire]] had become contagious. As the crisis progressed, the people of [[Zol]] went into hiding. As the ailment spread into the cities. The only solace that the mortal world had, was sunlight. [[Beastmen]] feared the light of day, and only stalked during the night.\n\n## Symptoms\nThe symptoms of [[Beast Ire]]:\n- The earliest symptoms are typically nightmares and a feeling of power\n- Increased strength, constitution and speed\n- Heightened senses\n- Extreme hunger\n- Aversion of water and sunlight\n- Obsession with lanternlight\n- Madness\n- In its most advanced state, the afflicted will develop any number of beast like traits\n\t- Fur, scales, amphibian traits, insectoid traits, or feathers\n\t- Glowing eyes\n\t- Sharp teeth\n\t- Horns or antlers\n\t- Claws or hooves\n\t- Elongated limbs\n\t- Quadrupedal mobility\n\t- Extra limbs\n\t- Increase size\n\t\t- Some rare cases an afflicted will be over 15 meters in length\n\t- In its most powerful state, beings will take on a nightmarish appearance. Long strange hair, many eyes, dark tendrils, exposed bone and viscera, an aura of madness, and unique magical abilities are just some examples of what powerful [[Beastmen]] manifest.\n\n## Societal Impact\n- The people of [[Zol]] had to hide in their homes save for hours around midday when the sun was at its most intense.\n- Proximity to the afflicted caused nightmares which haunted the population, and supposedly turned them to thralls on occasion.\n- Many brave individuals had to become [[Bloodhunters]] to defend the cities and cull the numbers of [[Beastmen]]\n- Some [[Beastmen]] became so powerful they gained worshippers\n- Some cities fell completely and were left to ruin. Others only fell for a time like [[Little Triumph]], [[Zessgorn]] or [[Reach Run]]\n- Races of beings who already bore beast-like traits faces great discrimination during these times. They segregated, exiled, and even executed for their beast-like heritage. These races were:\n\t- [[Harengon]]\n\t- [[Tabaxi]]\n\t- [[Aarakocra]]\n\t- [[Owlin]]\n\t- [[Kenku]]\n\t- [[Grung]]\n\t- [[Triton]]\n\n## Resolution\n[[Bloodhunters]] were able to kill off all of the known powerful [[Beastmen]] after years of vigorous labor. However the affliction was still present as thralls roamed [[Zol]]. It was thought that [[Zol]] would never be rid of [[Beast Ire]]. But one day the spread seemed to halt. Druids later discovered that [[Kerndall]] had struck a deal with [[The Wasp Eater]]. [[The Wasp Eater]] had seemingly played a hand in the plagues contagious nature, and had bested [[Kerndall]]. Their deal would have the remaining affliction transferred into [[Kerndall]]'s body, and the spread would cease. [[Kerndall]] would then become the servant of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] was maddened by the affliction, and was dubbed [[Kerndall, the Feral King]]. His son [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] took his throne. Slowly, [[Zol]] began to return to normalcy.\n\nSome of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed and prospects of beast blood. They instead hid in remote locations, maintaining [[Kerndall]]'s original ideals. After the resolution of [[Beast Ire]], they were granted new forms by [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]]. A cast of peoples now known as the [[Beastfolk]].\n\nIt is thought that [[Beast Ire]] is a dark thing of the past, however some believe that powerful [[Beastmen]] are still out there.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Beastfolk":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Beastfolk\"\n---*The descendants of those untempted by the [[Beast Ire]]*\n![[Beastfolk.png]]\n\n## Description\nThe [[Beast Ire]] plague began as boons of power from [[Kerndall]]. However the lust for power that burdened many mortals turned it into a corrupting force of darkness. However not all succumbed to the temptations of power. Those who stayed true to themselves became [[Beastfolk]] when the [[Beast Ire]] plague was overcome.\n\n[[Beastfolk]] are a very diverse cast of people who share traits with beasts. Some beast folk appear very animal-like, called *Full-Bloods*. While others appear more akin to the more ordinary races of [[Zol]] (dwarves, elves, humans, halflings, et cetera) and can change their form to be more animal like at will. These are called *Shifters*. The range of these bestial forms is very broad. Given compatible sexual characteristics, [[Beastfolk]] can mate with an person. The resulting offspring will also be a [[Beastfolk]] of one of the parents bestial heritages. The chance of it being a full-blood or a shifter is fifty-fifty.\n\nSome of the known bestial heritages are:\n- Canine\n- Ursidae\n- Cervidae\n- Reptilian\n- Rodent\n- Et Cetera\n\nOften the name [[Beastfolk]] will be adapted to better fit the charactristics of an individual such as: Ratfolk, Bearfolk, et cetera.\n\nThere is however a common confusion that causes much discourse in [[Zol]]. [[Beastfolk]] are a product of [[Speciatum Magica]], the product of magical happenstance that produces a whole race of beings. Before [[Beastfolk]] came to exist, many other animal like beings existed. These races now get commonly referred to as [[Beastfolk]], but are in fact physiologically, culturally, and historically different from [[Beastfolk]]. These [[Races]] are:\n- [[Harengon]]\n- [[Tabaxi]]\n- [[Aarakocra]]\n- [[Owlin]]\n- [[Kenku]]\n- [[Grung]]\n- [[Triton]]\nSome [[Beastfolk]] may even bear forms that appear similar to one of these races. However they are still biologically different.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 80-100 years |\n| Height | Varies widely based on bestial heritage |\n| Significant Locations | [[The Witchlands]] |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Beastfolk]] are often called [[Beastmen]] by ignorant, or racist individuals. This is a term of great offence to them. [[Beastmen]] were the monstrous evil that created the [[Beast Ire]] plague. [[Beastfolk]] are the descendants of the brave, and stalwart individuals who did not give into a lust for power. They are effectively the opposite of [[Beastmen]].\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Beastmen":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Beastmen\"\n---See [[Beast Ire]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Bethar":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Bethar\"\n---*Wayward God of Craft, Minor Deity*\n![[Bethar.png]]\n\nThe god of mortal creation and artistry. Bethar is a quiet but important god to [[Zol]]. Bethar gives guidance and favor to mortals who seek him. His aid manifests as guided skill and inspiration.\n\nFriend to the [[Zolaen Gods]], Bethar does not join them in their ranks. It is not known by mortals why this is. Some say it is due to his passive nature, while others say he is not of enough import to [[The Watcher]]'s mission. Because of this, the worship of Bethar is typically legal in any place where the worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]] is legal.\n\n## Depiction\nBethar is depicted as a man of older age in fine clothing. He is known to appear as a one of [[The Triumvirate]] races when he manifests. Many people argue his true form being one of the three in specific. This is however, regarded as religious propaganda by most.\n\n## Symbolism\nA tree on a light blue circle, similar to that on his forehead. No one knows the true nature of this symbol.\n\n## Behavior\nBethar is known to form a personal connection with many of his followers. He gives those he forms a bond with great time and care. Existing to them almost as an unseen friend. His mission is to guide mortals along the path of their own creation. To Bethar, creation itself is divinity.\n\n## Realm\nBethar resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], despite not being one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. This is likely due to some relationship he has with them that is poorly understood by mortals.\n\n## Worshipers\nBethar's followers are known to be craftsmen or artists. Few churches exist to Bethar in comparison to many other gods, and those that do are humble in their scale. \n\nCommunion with Bethar usually takes place whilst performing an act of craftsmanship.  This act itself is usually seen as the equivalent of worship or prayer.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Bloodhunters":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Bloodhunters\"\n---See [[Beast Ire]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Brass-Taldora":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Brass Taldora\"\n---See [[Ryze]] or [[The Brass Hall]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Cadence":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Cadence\"\n---*Wandering God, Moral of Adaptability*\n![[Cadence 2.png]]\n\nHe who is known by Manu Modica, Clausula, Cade, Ence, and Mao Leve. Known by many names and many forms, [[Cadence]] is the Wandering God of Adaptability. An ever-bending, forever-changing miasma that seeks harmony for the world.\n\n## Depiction\n[[Cadence]] is said to create a form for himself from the environment. A constellation of stars and a nimbus of clouds bending to appear as a leporine being. Distant hill top trees aligning to rabbit ears that perk up upon your notice. Steam rising over a pot of soup amalgamating to form his celestial silhouette.\n\nWhen not tampering with the manifestation of the physical world, [[Cadence]] appears similarly to a [[Harengon]]. His body has an ancient yet powerful appearance, but his face maintains a youthful appearance.\n\n## Moral\n[[Cadence]] teaches the Moral of Adaptability. At its core, this ideal teaches one to seek harmony with all things through acceptance of any given circumstance. Stretching ones limit to not only seek survival, but prosperity. Overcoming obstacles by redefining what an obstacle is.\n\n## Associations\n[[Cadence]] is associated with:\n- Music\n- Culinary Arts\n- Pirates\n- [[Harengon]]\n- Mischeif\n\n## Realm\nWhen travelling into [[Cadence]]'s reaches of [[The Unknown Realm]], the ground gives way to a strange cosmic space. Moving in this space is akin to swimming in air. \n\nThe area is jumble of strange but enticing objects floating in the odd vacuum as far as the eye can see. Food, instruments, statues, works of art, books, furniture, even entire buildings constructed with *Non-Euclidean Geometry* bob about the air.\n\n[[Cadence]] is said to spend his time here crafting these oddities. Academics are not sure as to why he would do this, and largely assume it is for his own enjoyment.\n\n## Behavior\nTo the uneducated eye, [[Cadence]]'s behavior seems erratic and even chaotic at times. He is known to be a trickster who throws mortals into strange situations. His behavior may turn on a dime between generous or demanding.\n\nFollowers of [[Cadence]] claim that is is done to *challenge* mortals. it is thought that putting the world in a place where unexpected, but great things can occur sews seeds for Adaptability.\n\nThe scripture and beliefs around [[Cadence]] make him the most dramatic of [[The Wandering Gods]]. This increased drama can be seen in the demeanor of his followers.\n\n## Worshipers\nCadence's followers are known to be erratic, but endearing. They follow his example, and never let the world predict their next move. They set about the [[Zol]], ever-chaotic, looking to find the most unexpected ways they can serve the greater good.\n\nSome call these folk *Yes-men* (the only named group of followers that worship [[The Wandering Gods]]). They are known to do random acts like leaving a baked pie on someone's doorstep, or completing unfinished construction projects overnight. Once a group of Yes-Men in [[Arcadia]] shredded every ledger of tax collector in broad daylight, then turned themselves in to law enforcement.\n\nYes-Men organize themselves in regular secret meetings called *The Determining* where goals are set foreword and decided upon by the Yes-Men. These set goals may involve small local projects or large pilgrimages.\n\nYes-Men are proselytizers, always sharing the word of Cadence in the most unexpected manner. Skeptics see them as ne'er-do-wells seeking to disrupt the balance of their preferred systems, while others think they are kind hearted oddities who bring good luck wherever they go.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Calendar":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Calendar\"\n---A calendar year in [[Zol]] is defined by 4 seasons, each 100 days long, with days being 24 hours.

This uniqueness has brought them many gifts, but equally as many challenges. [[Changelings]] look similar to elves, with stark white hair, skin and dark eyes. However they are not bound by this appearance. They may choose to adapt their form to any other form of their choosing, given it is of similar relative height and mass to their own body. This means they can appear as any person they choose, allowing them to create perfect disguises. Alternatively they can take a form entirely of their own creation, making their skin look like it was formed of moving crystal, and their hair of spun gold.\n\nAn individual changeling has much control over their identity. They can even willingly control their sexual characteristics. Their culture has adapted around this and two forms exist as ones identity:\n- Pure Form - The way one looks upon birth, the characteristic white hair and skin of [[Changelings]]. This form is a personal and sacred thing\n- True Form - A form that exists as an expression of self. It is designed by [[Changelings]] in their youth and is the form [[Changelings]] express for the majority of their lives. A True Form does not look like a typical body. An individual may make themselves look as if their skin was made of carved and stained wood, painted porcelain, and anything one can feasibly imagine.\n\n[[Changelings]] live almost exclusively within their own remote northern kingdom of [[The Glassius Reach]], where they worshiped powerful objects called [[The Oldshards]]. When the outside world learned of their ability to do this, fear an worry filled their minds. Non-changelings began to worry their neighbors had been replaced with [[Changelings]], sent to steal from them, or worse. The mystery and fear surrounding them eventually spiraled into the [[Western War]], a war that cost [[The Glassius Reach]] many losses. The greatest lost was that of one of [[The Oldshards]], [[The Apex]].\n\nThe loss of [[The Apex]] has not only caused religious and cultural trauma, but biological trauma as well. In modern day, 1 in 100 changelings born of [[Yorn et Gaul]] do not posses the ability to alter their body, locking them in their Pure Form. These [[Changelings]] are often referred to as *still*, and many see them as outcasts or freaks. The life of a still changeling is a very difficult one as most feel as if they have no place in [[Zol]].\n\nThis war was so damaging to [[Changelings]], it has politically divided them from the rest of the outside world, save for the occasional merchant relationship with [[The Ward]]. [[Changelings]] would not find themselves welcomed in most cities. Luckily for them, most can present themselves in any way they choose.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 80-100 years |\n| Height | 5'5-7' |\n| Significant Locations | [[The Glassius Reach]] |\n\n## Additional Info\n- The way [[Changelings]] adapt their form is not an [[Illusion]], but an actual [[Transmutation]] of their bodies. These changes take time to adopt (usually a few minutes), depending on the skill of the changeling\n- Those who believe in [[Great Magic]] think [[Changelings]] hold the aspect of ancient [[Humans]] that caused them to commit the ultimate sin which sparked [[The Undoing]].

[[Daetro]] is likely the most physically present god in [[Zol]].\n\nClergy will seek hermitage inside of [[Mount Zerstel]] and congregations will regularly cast sacrifices into the volcano itself.\n\nSome nomadic individuals will travel [[Zol]] spreading the word of [[Daetro]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Damnation":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Damnation\"\n---*The culmination of thousands of hells. All created to seek the destruction of [[Goh'zul]], now formed as one unified force of destruction. Still seeking to fulfil their original quest, their Ire now threatens [[The Prime]] as it is formed from what remains of their original nemesis. One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence.* \n\nThe land of the dead, and the punishment of [[Zol]]. [[Damnation]] is a subplane to [[The Void]] and home to [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] along with his legion of [[Fiends]].\n \n![[Damnation.png]]\n\n[[Damnation]] is divided into an unknown amount of layers. The known structure of [[Damnation]] is largely gained from reports given by the rare resurrected dead who were able to recall pieces of their time there, and Academics who have utilized magic to divine information about the horrifying place.\n\nDamnation is home to [[Fiends]], and the souls of the dead. These beings exist in all over Damnation in many different environments, all ruled by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]].\n\n## Apolyatum, The City of The Dead\nThe resting place for souls not fit for punishment. It is the highest layer of [[Damnation]]. Manifesting as a vast city in a colossal cavern. An ever present grey fog looms overheard. The fog sheds a faint yellow light when it nears the ground providing the only natural illumination in Apolyatum.\n\n![[Apolyatum.png]]\n\nMortal souls placed here are all given a very similar, grey toned, physically healthy body that echoes their appearance from the middle point of their lives.\n\nAll are given a chance at making a comfortable, eternal life in Apolyatum. Everyone arrives in the city with 3 stone coins and simple clothing.\n\nHere they can live lives similar to that of the mortal world. Making friends, eating food, and experiencing niceties. They also face class discrimination, brutality, and other inconveniences similar to life.\n\nMany odd jobs unique to Apolyatum are available to the souls here, but mostly consist of excavating the cave walls, constructing new homes, and agriculture.\n\nA group of [[Fiends]] known as *The Regal* act as the nobility and policing force of Apolyatum. Many souls spend their days serving them, but some successful souls rise to noble ranks as well.\n\n## The Tomb of Stone\nThe maze of pain. A seemingly endless labyrinth of punishment and monsters. Souls guilty of crimes not quite worthy of eternal punishment are sent here.\n\n![[The Tomb of Stone.png]]\n\nIndestructible monoliths are scattered all over the maze. Glowing with faint green marks that house the souls of those who trapped within the labyrinth.\n\nBeings sent to the labyrinth are forced to play in a horrible, endless game. They wake up in bodies at the base of the strange monoliths, with the knowledge that there are exits at the far reaches of the labyrinth that lead away from the Tomb.\n\nTo reach them, the must make their way through the dangerous maze filled with torturous traps, mechanical monsters, and fiendish abominations. When the damned are inevitably killed within the Tomb of Stone, they wake up in a new body at the base of a monolith, rather than facing the effects of [[The Mortal Coil]]. It is not known how this works, but it is assumed that the bodies used by the punished are not their true form which is instead held within the monoliths.\n\nThis creates a society of beings who live in constant fear. Always running, hiding, fighting, and dying. Factions of these people rise and fall, and even social or political hierarchies form.\n\nSouls are made to reside here for a unknown amount of years based on their punishment. They are only allowed to leave once their sentence is complete, or they make it to one of the impossibly far doors leading to other layers of [[Damnation]].\n\n## Zaereza\nOnly two things are known about Zaereza. It is a vast and expansive collection Damnation's layers, one of which contains the palace of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is also the grounds upon which souls are punished for an eternity.\n\n![[Zaereza.png]]\n\nIt is likely full of many distinct layers all with their own properties. However, the details of this remain unknown to the mortal world.\n\n## Obliteration\nWhere souls, too dangerous and horrible, are sent for destruction.\n\n![[Obliteration.png]]\n\nThe lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. Obliteration is an infrequently used tool, possessed by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. A place so grim and terrifying, its existence was once thought to be an impossibility.\n\nObliteration is completely devoid of color, and contains unnamed titans that wield colossal tools used to destroy souls.\n\nIt is not known why [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] destroys dangerous souls. Academics theorize it is to harvest power, or maintain order within hell.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Demodemacht":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Demodemacht\"\n---![[Demodemacht.png]]\n\nThe grandest mountain range in [[The Three Corners]]. [[Demodemacht]]'s perilous peaks are the largest in all the realm. Their grandeur is the setting for many-a-tale in the eastern culture. Known for its unique and treacherous terrain, including narrow passageways, complex caves, steep cliffs, and deep canyons. The range is also home to a variety of powerful creatures, including massive birds the size of houses, [[Giants]], griffins, and of course [[Dragons]]. The peaks of [[Demodemacht]] are said to be so high that they touch [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]].\n\nSome say the range is also home to a powerful and ancient order of monks who reside in secluded monasteries on the peaks. They are said to possess great wisdom and spiritual power, and are rumored to be able to control the world around them through physical power and mental fortitude.\n\nThere is no end to the folk lore around [[Demodemacht]]. Claims of it being the resting place of [[The Trinity]] itself, or it being a battleground for the [[Gods]]. Tales of crystals found deep within its caves that can grant immortality, or parables about a hidden valley, deep within the range, where a sleeping, forgotten god is said to dwell. Much of this is likely the prattling of common folk, but some of it may be based in truth.\n\nIt is also home to many odd and powerful individuals who reside within [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Location\nThe range extends across:\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Demons":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Demons\"\n---The unknown horrors of [[The Void]].

[[Demons]] hate [[Zol]] and seek its destruction. They hope to return [[Zol]] to the once chaotic and deconstructed state of The [[Sea of Monsters]].\n\n[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Diddan":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Diddan\"\n---*The Lawless Gun-Slinging Sand Dunes*\n![[Diddan Skyline.png]]\n\nFar from the comforts of the east, [[Diddan]] is a rough and tumble city of sandy streets and gruff gunslingers.

The surrounding sands contain trace metals which can be used for creating all manner of ranged weaponry. Some are simple, such as rifles that do not jam. Others are intricate and magical, firing rounds that can go around corners or release an explosion on impact. Many [[Artificers]] and craftspeople attempt to make facsimiles of these, some are non-magical mechanical guns, others are reasonably well made artillery. However no place within [[The Three Corners]] possesses such a collection of fine ranged weaponry as [[Diddan]]. |\n| Sifter               | Occupation   | Prospectors who use special equipment to sift rare metals used by [[Artificers]] out of the local sands. Typically done by the poorest members of the city. A weeks worth of work may only fill the bottom of a small vial with a given metal. The act of sifting was originally done with naturally occurring magnetic Lodestones that drew in specific metals, but has since progressed to using specifically designed [[Apparatum]] to accomplish the same task. The metals found are typically used by local gunsmiths or exported to distant [[Artificers]] at very steep prices.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Lawmen               | Occupation   | Local enforcers of the law, usually equipped with firearms. These individuals are charged with upholding the crowns will. While they do a reasonable amount of this, locals know them to be more concerned with filling their pockets by catering to the whims of the Gentry and corrupt throne within the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Cowboys              | Outlaw       | Local criminals, known to be equipped with firearms.

However it is famed for the quality of its exported firearms and rare metals.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Diddan]] is thought to be the cumulation of all old and near-lost cultures from The Badlands, the era before the found of the three kingdoms of [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Surrounding the city are many tiny communities that are under the jurisdiction of [[Diddan]], they typically consist of a few homes, farms, businesses, a general goods store, and a saloon. The names of these communities are:\n\t- Larshen\n\t- Dont\n\t- Blackwater\n\t- Pitts\n\t- Cryde\n\t- Mendin\n\t- Brackettsford\n\t- Quarry Sound\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Dislimn":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Dislimn\"\n---see the [[Fell]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Dorian":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Dorian\"\n---*Beauty can only be seen within The Watcher's Vision*\n![[Dorian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Dorian]] is a Zolaen-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that [[Zol]], and [[The Trinity]] by extension were created by [[The Watcher in The Door]] through [[The First Tongue]]. It views the [[Zolaen Gods]] as absolute in their power, and that all other forms of divinity are not truly holy.\n\nIt also view [[The Undoing]] as a sort of salvation. There are many interpretations of the cause of the event. Regardless of personal belief [[Dorian]] worship sees the [[The Awakening]] as a second chance for [[Zol]] granted by the [[Zolaen Gods]]. The defining characteristic of [[Dorian]] belief is the focus on perfection in the eyes of [[The Watcher]], or more accurately the Church's interpretation of [[The Watcher]]'s vision.\n\n## Values\n- Perfection\n- Striving for a better world\n- [[The Watcher]]'s vision for a second world\n- Forgiveness through [[The Awakening]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n-  The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[The Watcher]]\n\t- [[The Night Empress]]\n\t- [[The Lifeweaver]]\n\t- [[Yanneran]]\n\t- [[Tellab, the Wise]]\n\t- [[Giriam]]\n\t- [[Ayamot]]\n\t- [[Ohlit]]\n- Lesser [[Gods]] allied to the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[Bethar]]\n\t- [[Ellyon and Aradon]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Dorian]] scripture tells of [[The Watcher]] defeating [[Goh'zul]], then speaking [[The First Tongue]]. [[Arkian]] belief states that by speaking it in that moment, [[The Watcher]] created [[The First Tongue]]. Though this power he bound the other [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[The Trinity]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Dorian]] scripture teaches that ancient society was advanced and holy. However, it is thought that some darkness overtook the world in the later ages, which eventually lead to [[The Undoing]]. The specific nature of this darkness varies widely across various [[Dorian]] churches, and individual interpretation.\n\n### The Undoing\nAs a whole, [[Dorian]] belief does not agree much on the exact nature of what caused [[The Undoing]]. Though this has not caused too much discourse within the denomination because much of [[Dorian]] belief focuses on the idea that [[The Awakening]] was a salvation for the people of [[Zol]]. Though the main belief's within [[Dorian]] worship regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]] are:\n- Some great sin was carried out by all, or most of ancient civilization that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world.\n- Some great sin was carried out ancient [[Humans]] that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world. This belief is largely what is accepted within the [[Dorian]] churches of [[Gethsemane]].\n- An imbalance within [[The Trinity]] caused [[The Undoing]], but the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]]. This theory is particularly known for having many specific interpretations, and being particularly vague.\n- Some dark force such as [[The Anti-Trinity]] or [[The Shroud of the Void]] attacked [[Zol]], and caused [[The Undoing]]. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]].\n\n## Church Structure\n[[Dorian]] churches can manifest in one of two ways. The first being places of worship which are structured to worship all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] as a whole. These are called Octainiaries, after the eight gods. The second are places of worship structured to follow a specific member of the [[Zolaen Gods]], called Moniaries. The latter still pay respect to the pantheon as a whole, but they focus on the specific teachings and domain of a singular god.\n\nChurches may form as an individual organization, but often they are part of a larger collection of churches. Most commonly this is limited to the scope of a whole city, but sometimes they exceed that boundary.\n\nChurches are headed either an **Octavian Priest**, or a **Monian Priest** based on the type of church. Churches with a wider network are headed by **Zoltrum Octavian**, or a **Zoltrum Monian**. Beneath an Octavian or Monian Priest there are usually **High Priests**, and **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on the idea of betterment, and rediscovery of the world. By making [[Zol]] a better place, and comprehending it, one takes strides towards [[The Watcher]]'s true vision of [[Zol]].\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief largely focuses on the ideas of perfection, and living the *correct* way. This manifests as doing everything in ones power to excel at the things one dedicates themselves to, and present themselves as exemplary in the eyes of their peers, and [[The Watcher]]. In doing so, they become a piece of [[The Watcher]]'s great plan for [[Zol]]. Fundamentalist belief is also directed outwards. Fundamental Dorians often cast judgement on others, especially those who live sinful lives, or worship other gods.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[Dorian]] worship is extremely widespread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]]. Most notably in the western kingdoms of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Other Information\n-  [[Arkian]] worship is very similar to [[Dorian]] worship, however they differ in the sense that [[Arkian]] belief focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and atonement. [[Arkian]] belief sees the modern world as an opportunity for atonement. [[Dorian]] belief instead focuses on the idea of the modern world being a second chance at life. The two churches were once a single denomination, but diverged long ago. This divergence occurred before razing events like the [[Beast Ire]] Plague, and possibly even [[The Dragon War]]. The true nature of this divergence has been lost to time, and is largely debated.\n- Theologians and sociologist believe that in the coming centauries, more branches of Zolaen-Centric belief will break off [[Dorian]] worship due to differences in beliefs regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Draedon-the-Ascended-Wizard":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Draedon, the Ascended Wizard\"\n---*Wayward God of The Arcane Arts, Minor Deity*\n![[Draedon.png]]\n\nThe uncontested, He who has unraveled the secrets of [[Arcana]].

They are few in number, but posses both a power and culture unlike any other. There are many types of dragons, each with its own unique traits and dispositions. The presence of [[Dragons]] shaped [[Zol]] in its early days after [[The Awakening]], and their influence continues to this day.\n\n[[Dragons]] come in many shapes and sizes. Most commonly they are known for their large scaled bodies, giant wings, toothy maws, and magical influence. Most are known for their intelligence and capacity for speech. However, not all dragons fit into this categorization. Some have strange physiology like massive turtle shells, smooth skin or serpent like bodies. Others do not posses the high intelligence or speech commonly associated with [[Dragons]]. \n\nTheir species itself is actually made up of a wide range of many unique subspecies. Plenty have been categorized and documented, but there is still much to be learned about [[Dragons]]. Most fit into the species that academia has indexed, but others are referred to as Dracis Obscura, as they possess unique, poorly understood characteristics.\n\nDragons relate to each other in strange ways. Most are solitary, however they do interact with each other more than one would expect. Each has their own unique name, and place in dragon society. Those who have spoken with dragons have discovered that they surprisingly know many of their peers. Most dragons have friends, rivals, and love interests. Dragons largely view the people of [[Zol]] as lesser, however they pay quite a bit of attention to the world's civilizations. Most see them as prey, others see them as friends, some merely find them entertaining. Some ignore mortals entirely.\n\nSome traits are shared amongst all [[Dragons]]. The first is an affinity for [[Magic]]. The degree with which this occurs varies greatly based on the type of dragon, however all seem to exude and influence over [[Magic]] not seen in other creatures. The other is increased power with age. Most [[Dragons]] are thought to be immortal, and if they are not they typically live for hundreds of years. As they age, both their magical and physical power increases. Ancient Dragons are typically around 1000 years old, and their magic is so powerful that it can actually effect the environment near to their lair.\n\n## Chromatic Dragons\nSpawned from the body of [[Zelatt]], [[Chromatic Dragons]] are the most common type of Dragon. They are known for their evil and chaotic nature, as well as their connection to [[Energy]] and tell tale colors. \n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are infamous for hoarding treasure, and sewing chaos. They are the offspring of [[Zelatt]], the Void God of Chaos. From her form she is able to create powerful [[Chromatic Dragons]]. These dragons go on to reproduce on their own, but they all connect back to her essence. They do not serve her directly, but their behavior tends to serve [[Zelatt]] well. The dark being is said to feed off of chaos, and [[Chromatic Dragons]] are usually well entertained by this concept. However not all [[Chromatic Dragons]] are evil, some take on very unique personalities.\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are categorized by color, and corresponding energetic affinity. Offspring are known to take on only a single color of their parentage at random.\n\n- Red Dragons - Fire [[Energy]]\n- White Dragons - Frost [[Energy]]\n- Blue Dragons - Lightning [[Energy]]\n- Grey Dragons - Necrotic [[Energy]]\n- Yellow Dragons - Radiant [[Energy]]\n- Green Dragons - Poisonous [[Energy]]\n- Black Dragons - Acidic [[Energy]]\n- Purple Dragons - Cognitive [[Energy]]\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] which are born directly from [[Zelatt]] are called Fractal Dragons. They are extremely powerful, and have unique powers.\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are known for their hate towards [[Metallic Dragons]]\n\n## Metallic Dragons\n[[Metallic Dragons]] are the acolytes of [[Ayamot]]. They are the rare, good-willed counterpart to [[Chromatic Dragons]]. No one truly knows if [[Metallic Dragons]] were created to defend the people of [[Zol]] from [[Chromatic Dragons]], but many believe that this is the case. They first appeared to the people of [[The Three Corners]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Some say they manifested from light, others claim they broke free of their slumber from deep within [[The Underdark]]. Regardless of their origin, they are a very rare cast of dragons who largely seem concerned with the concept of order and justice. However some have strayed from this, and act on their own accord. Some even live more similarly to their evil cousins, the [[Chromatic Dragons]].\n\nThe Draconic names for their various subspecies are long complicated phrases, but academics categorized them based on the metallic content of their scales. The latter names stuck better than the former. The types of [[Metallic Dragons]] are: \n- Gold Dragons\n- Silver Dragons\n- Bronze Dragons\n- Copper Dragons\n- Brass Dragons\n- Mercury Dragons\n- Steel Dragons\n- Platinum Dragons\n\n[[Metallic Dragons]] are rivals with [[Chromatic Dragons]], however they do not seek their destruction. They only seem concerned with enacting justice when a line is crossed.\n\n## Gem Dragons\nThe extremely rare offspring of [[Metallic Dragons]] and [[Chromatic Dragons]]. These [[Dragons]] are known to be quite powerful, and exceptionally rare. They are easily distinguished by their crystalline scales. So little is known about these dragons that academics hesitate to define their behavior. However from what is known, it seems that their disposition varies greatly amongst the specimens recorded. The recorded types of Gem Dragons are:\n- Amethyst Dragons\n- Emerald Dragons\n- Sapphire Dragons\n- Topaz Dragons\n- Obsidian Dragons\n\nTheir rarity is likely a product based on the divide between Chromatic and Metallic Dragons.\n\n## Lesser Dragons\nMany species exist that have some of the physical and magical characteristics of greater dragons like [[Chromatic Dragons]], or [[Metallic Dragons]]. Some of them exhibit high intelligence, but few posses the capacity for speech. As a whole, Lesser Dragons are not nearly as powerful as some of their more magically inclined cousins. Some examples of Lesser Dragons are:\n- Drakes\n- Wyverns\n- Pseudodragons\n- Faerie Dragons\n\n## Dracis Obscura\nThe Strange, and obscure dragon specimens academics have made note of over the years which do not match up with other [[Dragons]]. They are exceedingly rare, and thought to be exceptionally powerful. Many believe that some members of this category are entirely unique manifestations of magic, and not part of a greater species. Some examples of these creatures are:\n- Dragon Turtles\n\t- Colossal sea dragons who posses shells as large as small islands.\n- Pink Dragons\n\t- Strange dragons some believe to be a type of Chromatic Dragon, however they are said to have a unique, *dumb* appearance. Those who claim to have encountered them say that they are unconcerned with the concept of violence and greed, and are much more interested in having fun and telling jokes.\n- Sea Wyrms\n\t- Wicked and powerful sea monsters who are frequent mentions in the stories of sailors. Said to have long, serpent like bodies, and seek pirate treasure.\n- Brain Dragons\n\t- A folk legend dating all the way back to [[The Illithid Invasion]]. It is said that the parasitic nature of [[Illithids]] was able to take over the bodies of dragons, converting them into unimaginable horrors.\n- Dracolich\n\t- Said to be dragons who have willingly undergone the effects of powerful necromancy, making them fearsome and undead.\n- The Draxolotl\n\t- A legend of [[The Witchlands]]. A supposed legendary dragon who lives within the lakes of the regions, and appears similarly to an axolotl or salamander. A benevolent being who grants wishes to those who find him.\n\n## Stages of Dragon Maturity\nDragons increase in power as they age. Lesser Dragons experience this on a much smaller scale, but Chromatic, Metallic, and Gem Dragons move through quite the range of power.\n\n- Hatchling - 1 to 5 years\n\t- Small and very influenceable creatures. A hatchling would be a fairly dangerous threat to a commoner. However one encountering one should be more concerned with their mother who would likely be nearby.\n- Young Dragon - 5 to 100 years\n\t- Proud temperamental beings. Young dragons are quite dangerous, but they lack the wisdom, size, and magic of their elders.\n- Adult Dragon - 100 to 800 years\n\t- Powerful, and fearsome creatures. An attack from an adult dragon would spell many casualties for a city. In their advanced age, they posses a wisdom that is rarely seen in most beings.\n- Ancient Dragon - 800 to 1200 years\n\t- Some of the most dangerous, and awe inspiring beings in [[Zol]]. Ancient dragons posses an understanding of the world that many academics would give their right leg to document. An attack from an Ancient Dragon would leave permanent scars on a city.\n- Wyrm - 1200 to 1600 years\n\t- Extremely rare, and spectacularly powerful beings. Few Wyrms have even been documented. Their power would be great enough to possibly destroy a small city on their own. However beings of this capacity would likely not trouble themselves with the pitiful world of mortals.\n- Great Wyrm - 1600+ years \n\t- There are no records of encounters with Great Wyrms, however some Dragons have spoken of these beings. It is not know what power they hold, but they are understood to essentially be small [[Gods]].\n\n## Historical Significance\nThe most notable impact of [[Dragons]] in [[Zol]]'s history is [[The Dragon War]].\n\n## Dragons and Society\nIn modern day, [[Dragons]] are often feared and revered in [[Zol]]'s stories. Few dragon sightings occur, and even fewer attacks. It is thought that most dragons spend their time in hibernation. It is not known why this is, and [[Dragons]] asked of it refuse to answer.\n\nTwo races bear charactristics, and by extension the prejudice of [[Dragons]]. These [[Races]] are [[Dragonborn]] and [[Kobolds]]. The connection between [[Dragons]] and these races are not understood, however it is known that neither race possesses the strength and magic that greater dragons do.\n\nSome believe that the Greater [[Dragons]] are a dying thing of the past. Other say they walk amongst the people of [[Zol]] in magical person-like forms.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Dragonstalkers":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Dragonstalkers\"\n---See [[Hoss]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Drow":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Drow\"\n---See [[Elves]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Druids":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Druids\"\n---Those who use [[Magic]] through [[Viridescence]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Dwarves":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Dwarves\"\n---*The Mountain Folk, thought to be favored by the Gods*\n![[Dwarf.png]]\n\n## Description\nProud, strong, and resilient.

However, the informational [[Energy]] given off by [[Elves]] confirms them to each be one third of a greater whole.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Elysium-Station":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Elysium Station\"\n---*The Gateway to the Sky*\n![[Station Skyline.png]]\n\nThe sister city to the floating capital of [[Heliodor]]. Geographically within [[Eucaren]], but considered under the jurisdiction of [[Heliodor]], Elysium station was originally constructed with the express purpose of acting as a commerce and transportation hub for the capital. Being so centrally located and associated with the capital, it quickly grew into a small city in its own right. However it is extremely young for a city, and faces many issues that Heliodor does not due to its privilege as a flying city. These issues manifest as bandits, monsters, and overpopulation. Many people view it as part of the capital itself, but it has its own distinct citizens and culture that make it a unique city.\n\n![[elysium_station.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city breathes in and out with the flow of the capital above. In the morning, workers flood out of the city to serve in [[Heliodor]], and return to their homes at days end. Resources and important individuals flow through the station like a river. The humble city has an atmosphere of importance despite its size. |\n| Main Challenge | The city lives in the shadow of [[Heliodor]]. Figuratively and literally. As much opportunity exists within [[Elysium Station]], sometimes citizens can't help but feeling lowly in comparison to the capital above. The desires and consumption of the grand capital can have unfortunate biproducts for the city below.

A small group of very proud individuals who see themselves as very important. However outside parties view them as those who either 'didn't quite make it' to the capital, or those who are unfavored by more important nobility and are pushed out of the capital as punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Commoners | Social Class | The vast majority. Those who either work to keep the station functioning, or are employed within [[Heliodor]] in some humble profession. Shop keepers, farmers, servants, guards, performers, airship crew, maintenance, janitorial, gardeners, and things of the like. Most people leave the city via the [[Skyferry]] at morning and return at dusk, but some face more complex shift work coming and going at odd hours. To work in the city above, one must acquire a special certification called a [[Flatkey]]. Which are small brass keys provided to workers who can go in and out of the city. |\n| Beggars   | Social Class | The few who have fallen on hard times, or come to the city in hopes to receive aid from generous nobility. Be it donation or employment. There are fanciful rumors about the great golden city where anyone can get help from the flying capital. However these were merely rumors stemmed from propaganda.

Lord Maude is notably not a High Lord. The city is under the jurisdiction of the capital, [[Heliodor]]. Making the true power of the city [[King Tatelak II]]. However this is technically the case for all city's of [[Laenwalde]], so it doesn't make much of a functional difference here. However the public opinion of the ruling powers within [[Elysium Station]] is that they do not posses true political sway. Many view them as if they are lowly compared to other nobility.\n\nLord Maude himself does well with the stations management. However he is surrounded by many rumors of him being resentful towards his position and the king. \n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, the city is merely seen as a waypoint. Most don't even consider it a true city.\n\n## Historical Importance\nIt is the youngest city in all of [[The Three Corners]] even more so than [[Heliodor]] itself. Built to serve as a proxy and gateway for the flying city, [[Elysium Station]] finds itself growing slowly but surely as more and more opportunities emerge.\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Enchantment":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Enchantment\"\n---A term often used to describe the utilization [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] or [[Iron Light]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Ep-Drukar":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ep Drukar\"\n---*The Elemental City*\n![[Ep Drukar skyline 3.png]]\n\n[[Ep Drukar]] is home to the [[Genasi]].

The [[Genasi]] call the region *Tsarde'n*, and it stretches from their mountain, Ableom, to the western sea. The [[Genasi]] hid upon these peaks for many generations. They were aware of the existence of outsiders, but knew they bonded no [[Sylfs]]. This fact, and the guidance of the [[Sylfs]] kept [[Ep Drukar]] hidden away from the rest of the world for more than 2000 years. When it was eventually discovered, the following relationships between [[Ep Drukar]] and its neighboring cities were peaceful in nature. However their long standing disconnection has made it difficult for the city and its people to integrate with the outside world. Outsider's who visit [[Ep Drukar]] will find unique culture, vast wisdom, and strange magic. However they will also find stubbornness, a lack of modern technology, and naiveite regarding the outside world. |\n| Climate                  | High altitude

As well as an unbound [[Genasi]], also called a *Halcyon* [[Genasi]]. This council is charged with guiding their city's decisions, and ensuring daily life is maintained. Each member of the five selects their successor, unless they perish suddenly. In that case the successor is chosen by the remaining four. |\n| Water Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Mistings, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of water.

While each one is individually unique, they are known to be extremely passionate individuals. Separating logic and emotion is quite difficult for a Fire [[Genasi]]. They are known as dedicated go-getters, die hard friends, and also to be a bit of a pain in the ass.                                                 |\n| Earth Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Stalegs, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Earth.

While each one is individually unique, they are known to be wild and care free. Their flippant attitudes can be frustrating at times, but their fun loving ideals, and excitable personalities tend to outweigh their wandering focus.                                                                                    |\n| Halcyon Genasi | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who do not bond [[Sylfs]]. There are many opinions of this type of [[Genasi]], but the most prominent one is that they are lesser or simple. This is an unspoken thing, and very frowned upon to say aloud. However many who bind [[Sylfs]] find it difficult to not feel this way. The fact of the matter is they are no more simple than their bound neighbors, they merely did not find a sylf with a compatible personality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name               | Type   | Description                                                                                                                    |\n| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Temple of Tsarde'n | Keep   | The city's central structure.

A group of elders responsible for the city's well being. They lead the Temple of Tsarde'n and posses a very small, but capable group of fighters. Members of the five give up their old name when taking the mantle of elder, they instead use the name given to the position.\n\nThe Five are as follows:\n- Hilaen, Elder of Water\n- Sidoren, Elder of Fire\n- Yimir, Elder of Earth\n- Aesudon, Elder of Air\n- Kaldeg, the Halcyon Elder\n\nThe elders maintain a city where everyone is treated as equals, and has their needs met to the best of the cities abelites. However the city's remote nature, and mountain top location does mean that they fall on hard times on occasion.\n\n### Laws\nThe city does not posses a written set of laws. Disputed matters are decided by The Five. Things like: murder, theft, trespassing, fraud, and things of the like are almost always lead to sever punishment. [[Genasi]] culture simply views these things as so obviously wrong they do not need specific rules, merely the wisdom of elders to deal with.\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Ep Drukar]] is one of the many cities who has an almost mythical reputation. It is extremely remote, and no teleportation circle, or train can take you there. To reach it one must venture very very far.\n\nThe city has almost no impact in the grand scheme of [[The Three Corners]]. However some [[Genasi]] leave the city on pilgrimages, bringing stories of their strange homeland with them. \n\n## Historical Importance\nLong ago, the city's existence was not even known to outsiders. It was only in the year 2811 that elven scouts discovered it. At the time, [[Gethsemane]] was at war with [[Kapesh]] and did not wish to have an enemy on multiple fronts. Peace treaties were quickly put in place and [[Ep Drukar]] was allowed to continue its way of life uninterrupted.\n\nThis neutrality was maintained during the [[Western War]]. [[Ep Drukar]] sits very close to the border of [[The Glassius Reach]] and [[Gethsemane]]. However all the involved cities knew their peaceful ways, and allowed [[Ep Drukar]] to maintain a neutral party in the conflict.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The surrounding region, called Tsarde'n by the [[Genasi]] is not thought to be a geographical region. Its borders are more fluid, and defined only by the guidance of [[Sylfs]]. It is said that Tsarde'n is where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is the thinnest.\n- There are many rumors about an ancient and horrible secret located in the center of the Temple of Tsarde'n, and that the real reason for the [[Genasi]]'s isolation is to protect this secret. It is also thought that this thing is the reason for the easily obtained peace treaties with its neighboring cities. \n- There are no slaves in [[Ep Drukar]]\n- Education within the city is typically done through monastic tradition conducted at the Temple of Tsarde'n.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Eptro":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Eptro\"\n---*Wayward God of Ice, Minor Deity*\n![[Eptro.png]]\n\nLord of the frost, Eptro is the spirit of ice and the frozen expanses that exist in [[Zol]].

It exists under the influence of [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\n![[fey 1.png]]\n\nIt is known for its many wonderous features. The natural landscape is full of strange mountains, magical forests, and other oddities like floating forests of vines in the sky.\n\nWhile gorgeous, the [[Fey]] is quite dangerous. Filled with odd beasts, monsters and other inhabitants. One would not want to be here unprepared.\n\n![[fey 2.png]]\n\nThe beings who reside in the fey are known for having sharp minds, adept magical abilities, and being quite mischievous.\n\n## Citizens of The Fey\nThere is one known city within the [[Fey]]. It is known by the name of [[Hymnal]], and is home to a group of [[Elves]] who left the [[Prime Material Plane]] shortly after [[The Undoing]].\n\n![[Hymnal skyline.png]]\n\nThese [[Elves]], known as [[Eladrin]] were once [[High Elves]] of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Thousands of years spent in the [[Fey]] has caused their biology to change significantly.\n\nThose who live in the [[Fey]] are xenophobic, any being who is uninvited to their home is met with significant resistance upon seeking entrance.\n\nOther more reclusive or rare races like [[Fairies]] also hail from this realm. Some of which live amongst the city of [[Hymnal]].\n\nStrangely, iron is hated amongst those native to the [[Fey]]. Academics do not know why this is, but [[Fey]] natives experience great pain when in contact with the substance and can even claim to smell a putrid scent off of those who have worn iron recently. [[Iron Light]] is very uncommon within the [[Fey]] due to this fact.\n\n## Travel to The Fey\nSince the [[Fey]] is an echo of the [[Prime Material Plane]], travel between these planes is much simpler than most other cases. There are even many natural portals to the [[Fey]] that emerge and disappear naturally all over the [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\nIf one travels between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the [[Fey]] they would expect to end up in the same spot geographically, but on the other side.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Fiends":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Fiends\"\n---[[Fiends]], sometimes called Devils, are the acolytes of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. There are an evil cast of heinous creatures. They are either the descendants of, or the very beings who were created long ago to destroy [[Goh'zul]]. \n\nLong before The [[Sea of Monsters]] even existed. [[Goh'zul]] was a being who had the power to create worlds, grow them, and devour them to satiate his endless hunger. Many of the worlds he made were aware of his existence, and tried to stop their destruction. A strange, repeating phenomenon occurred in many of these realms. Legions of [[Fiends]] were made by the gods of these long dead worlds in a futile attempt to strike back at [[Goh'zul]]. They would be given a realm of their own, called a *Hell*. It is not know why this phenomenon happened so regularly. Perhaps it was part of [[Goh'zul]]'s design, or perhaps it was just convergent evolution of these worlds.\n\nAs a method of payment, the gods would often send the souls of sinners to the fiends as payment. It is not known why this transaction was made, but many assume it was for sustenance or to entertain them. Regardless, the exchange largely kept them at bay.\n\nDespite the efforts of these worlds, it was never enough to defeat him. When he would consume them, he would leave the hells undigested (for lack of a better term). They sat trapped in his body for eons. Eventually, they began colliding and merging. When they all formed into one singular, colossal realm, a massive war amongst them eventually left [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] as their ruler.\n\nNot all [[Fiends]] are evil, supposedly some of them in [[Apolyatum]] are quite reasonable and person-like. However the vast majority are nefarious and horrifying. Their once mission to destroy [[Goh'zul]], and their hatred towards him for trapping them in his body like a prison has only fortified their original mission to destroy him. However, since he is dead that hate is instead aimed at the world of [[Zol]].\n\n[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.334015127Z","tags":null},"/Firbolgs":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Firbolgs\"\n---*Peaceful and Brave*\n![[Firbolg.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Firbolgs]] are known to be generally agreeable people.

Each team has a raft held 100 feet above water that is 2 feet by 25 feet, called a **Rung**. Each team has 5 **Beams**, and 3 **Catchers**. **Beams** are not allowed to fly, and stand in a row upon their raft, each armed with 2 sandbags wrapped in a buoyant material called **Bells**.

[[Zol]] is an extremely dangerous place; bandits, monsters, and war have shaped the nature of cities in very clear ways throughout [[Zol]]'s history. Walls were constructed to protect cities from these threats. However, walls hinder the expansion of a city. This limits the amount of people who can live within the safety of a city's walls.\n\nIdeally, one wants to be within the walls if they fear the dangers of [[Zol]]. However, the next best thing to living within the walls is to live just outside of them. As these regions are patrolled by city garrisons, and most can take refuge inside the inner city during a siege. Additionally, the proximity to a city allows for one to benefit from its economy and living in a [[Gate Town]] is much more accessible to most commoners. Due to these factors, [[Gate Town]]s have consistently popped up all over [[Zol]] as soon as city walls are constructed.\n\nA similar phenomenon to this is [[Outer Villages]], which are more a product of agriculture than [[Gate Town]]s are a product of other forms of commerce. Both are populated almost exclusively by lowly commoners, and are usually the first to feel the wrath of warfare when it finds a city. Additionally, since there is no physical barrier stopping bandits and monsters from entering, these communities often find themselves at the mercy of these dangers.\n\nAnother related concept is [[Estates]] which are walled properties of land outside of the city, usually owned by the rich.

This bond grants [[Genasi]] with a control of Fire, Water, Earth, or Wind.\n\nWhen a [[Genasi]] is born, they do not have an element associated with them.

I wanted to leave it up to the user (Like a Dungeon Master running a game in D\u0026D 5e deciding how many people live within an area, rather than me telling it strictly beforehand). I think that adjusting the population to better fit the story being told, rather than applying firm numbers is better.\n\n*Similarly for distance, I don't like to think about how many days by train, horse, or foot it takes to get from A to B until it makes sense for the pacing of the story that is being told.*\n\n*However, there are a few things I intended for these concepts which will help define relative numbers when storytelling in Zol.*\n\n## Population\n[[Cities]] are meant to feel very populated, even small cities should feel like they are relatively dense in their population.

The lift operates over thousands of feet and can support extremely heavy burdens. Remarkably, the lift originally used no [[Magic]] in its operation.\n\nDesigned by Odile Gilligan, a gifted Halfling academic woman. Gilligan originally decided to construct the lift only using engineering to spark a movement against [[Zol]]'s over reliance on [[Magic]] wielding individuals. \n\n## Design\nBuilt as a wide platform suspended by a massive pulley system. Energy for moving the lift is drawn from massive turbines affixed to the wall of the cliff. Powered by the massive gusts of wind that blow vertically up the cliffs face, energy is stored in large springs. A wide platform acts as the lift itself, built of strong metals and wood to resists the same gusts that power it. This makes it capable of moving large quantities of personnel and equipment.\n\n![[Gilligans Lift.png]] \n\nSince the invention of [[Iron Light]], magical improvements have been made for durability, defense, and efficiency. However the core functionality remains non-magic due to its ingenious design. In modern days a one way trip of the lift takes 5 hours. \n\n## Impact on Society\nThe lift's operation was given to [[The Bladehammer Guild]].

It was not at first known by the public that a god had supposedly died, but the effects of his death were immediate and catastrophic. Growth rates all across [[Zol]] varied with great severity. Some places were struck with devastating famine. However others faced unforeseen abundance, causing harvests so bountiful that fruit rotted on the vines, leading to plagues of pests as farmers could not keep up.\n\nBirth rates also faced extreme change. In some places, birth rates plummeted, while others feared overpopulation.\n\nThe public only became aware when other [[Gods]] began to speak of the event. Most denied the events validity, and many still do to this day. However the effects were so widespread that over time, most have come to realize that something significant has effected the domains of agriculture and fertility.\n\nThe initial effects of Giriam's death started to trend towards normalcy 6 years after the gods supposed death. However the secondary effects like societal and theological panic still remains.

This prejudice is held by many, and has much evidence to back it up. Many goblins live outside of cities in bandit tribes, or live in squalor within cities. However a dive into their history paints a tragic picture of a people forced into hardship.\n\nWriting from the early days after [[The Awakening]] tell of goblins who would eat food considered by most to be 'raw' or 'spoiled'. They would reside in small spaces and drink 'unpotable' water. They were assumed to be unintelligent and dirty because of this. Many would treat them poorly; putting them down both verbally and physically. It was not understood at the time that goblins instinctually organize in a hierarchy. The abuse unknowingly took advantage of this predisposition. It made them timid and subservient. When pushed too far they would lash out in a way that is described in these old texts as 'feral'. \n\nThis mistreatment drove them into the dark corners of society, or from civilization entirely. In modern day, we see [[Goblins]] that thrive when treated equally. Modern science and medicine shows goblins are much more resistant to disease and poison (allowing them to consume things that are raw, spoiled, or unpotable). They are also known to be more comfortable living in small spaces.\n\nDespite the modern understanding, prejudice is a hard thing to be rid of.

They invaded [[Zol]] from [[The Space Outside Reality]] during the [[First Age]]. Their home world is a poorly understood, and abstract place that [[Illithids]] captured and interrogated during [[The Illithid Invasion]] spoke of. Their species seems to have a hybrid of individual and hive consciousness. Most records tend towards the latter, where a large group of [[Illithids]] share their forms with a more powerful being called an Elder Brain. Little is know about Elder Brains, but they manifest as massive brains with tentacle like protrusions that span huge distances like a slime mold. However, an Illithid seems to have the capacity to break free of an Elder Brain with a great deal of effort. This gives them an agency of their own, but so little is understood about them this may only be one facet to the complex species.\n\nThey reproduce parasitically, [[Illithids]] produce tadpoles which can enter a host, and take over their body. This process takes time, but when it is complete the host will be 100% Illithid in their biology. This change also effects them cognitively, and most seem like completely different people. The minds of a host are very pliable at the time of this change. It is usually at this time an Elder Brain will take over the mind, and bring it into the hive. Each changed Illithid will have their own unique appearance which slightly reflects that of the host.\n\nThe beings are fascinated with magic, and knowledge. They even seem to be able to feed off of Cognitive [[Energy]], however they can partake in normal food as well. The purpose of their invasion is not well understood by academics, but it is largely considered that they came to [[Zol]] in search of something. However, they poorly underestimated the people of [[Zol]] and were defeated. When the survivors fled, they left a few of their species behind. Now [[Illithids]] lurk in the dark corners of [[Zol]], barely reproducing enough to keep their species alive. Some conduct horrors to strange, unknown purposes. Others merely attempt to hide, and lead a normal life in disguise. They are so few in number that most forget the possibility of even encountering one.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | Unknown |\n| Height | Varies based on host, but the conversion to Illithid usually adds a foot or two. |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Illithids]] are usually extremely intelligent, regardless of their host's past.

It is an immensely complex form of writing and [[Enchantment]] that only [[Speakers]] can use and understand. Unlike its sister practice of [[Iron Light]] which uses logic and mathematics, [[Iszertion]] is more instinctual and difficult to explain to those who do not know [[The Old Tongue]]. It is best described as utilizing the same powers that speaking [[The Old Tongue]] gives, but rather than speaking, it is written down. It is also important to know that merely being able to speak [[The Old Tongue]] does not mean one can utilize [[Iszertion]]. It is a skill that must be learned. It is possible to use [[Iszertion]] with any of [[The Wills]], but it is almost always associated with [[Arcana]]. This is likely because the manifestations of [[Speakers]] who utilize the wills of [[Observance]] and [[Viridescence]] do not lean on their own creations as often as [[Arcanists]]. \n\nThe will that is being leveraged for [[Iszertion]] greatly changes the appearance of the characters and diagrams involved.\n- [[Arcana]] - Appears as very exact geometry and strange symbol with no discernable alphabet behind them, each character is unique to its specific purpose.\n- [[Viridescence]] - appears as flowing lines and intersecting round shapes\n- [[Observance]] - appears as a single, complex rune made up of many intersecting lines, curves, and shaded areas\n\n[[Iszertion]] can either directly change the properties of an object to accomplish magical feats. It can also be used to relay massive amounts of complex information as a form of writing.\n\nPerforming [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] using [[Iszertion]] takes a very long time, and is extremely dangerous. The chance of [[Magical Backfire]] is very great. It is often called Grand [[Arcana]], and it produces some of the most powerful magical objects. It is made much easier by utilizing magical components that already posses the properties one is seeking to imbue magically. A sword made with [[Iszertion]] will be much more successful if [[Mythril]] is used rather than mere steel.\n\n## Relation to the Ferric Alphabet\nMany have sought to form a connection between [[Iszertion]] and [[Iron Light]].

Protected from outside influences by its giant iron gate, [[Jerda'll]] is truly a sight and sound to behold. Its people are known to sing and play old songs called [[The Acrylons]]. These pieces of music are said to aid them in their daily pursuits, share emotion, honor their dead, and protect their oldest stories from the withering effects of time.\n\n[[The Acrylons]] can almost always be heard within the city in some capacity. Blacksmiths singing songs of metal work, pedestrians humming tunes that denote their mood or journey's purpose, city guard chanting low simple songs of order.

These melodies are taught to children parallel with things like language, and etiquette. [[The Acrylons]] give a sense of community, synchronicity, and connectedness to all people of the city. Their echoing through the caves fills the city with a sense of heartfelt warmth on good days, and a haunted feeling on darker ones.  It is said that a [[Drow]] far from home can touch a raw stone and hear the songs of their people.\n\n![[jerdall.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Main Opportunity         | Citizens of [[Jerda'll]] posses [[The Acrylons]], a unique form of musical communication that creates an interconnected society amongst the [[Drow]]. The city's people can react and respond to the song they hear around them. An uneducated eye may think the city moves like a machine, where each person fits into a functional box and their songs mesh together like the teeth of gears. The truth is more like the innerworkings of nature. There is an everchanging flow to the city, but you can see its truths if you know how to listen for it. Those who can comprehend it, can glean much from the city by ear alone. |\n| Main Challenge           | Residing underground can be an isolating way of life. However this is favorable to many [[Drow]]. So favored in fact, they keep their gates barred shut for to all outside parties. Guests are only allowed on official business, formal invitation, or the rare event. Outsiders are easy to spot in the city as they bear no songs. Most feel very out of place in the city.

She is known for being extremely wise and decisive. The Maer of [[Jerda'll]] is not known to move amongst the common people, and has a sort of mystery about her, even to the locals.\n\nShe and her army are a force to be reckoned with. Her army of fighters, specialized in close quarters combat due to their underground location.\n\n### Laws\nThe city enforces its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Murder                              | High        | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission.

To outsiders, it lives mostly in rumors and myths of the common folk, but more worldly individuals are still relatively unaware of the city's daily life.\n\nIt does however, act as one of [[The Three Corners]]' primary access point to [[The Underdark]], but it is almost exclusively used by the kingdom of [[Gethsemane]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nHistorically, the armies of [[Jerda'll]] have been a fearsome and intimidating force. Those who have gone to war with [[Gethsemane]] would typically face extended ranged battles. However if [[Gethsemane]] got the upper hand, and could get a dispatchment of foot soldiers beyond enemy reinforcements, those who saw the black armor of [[Jerda'll]] knew they stood on death's door.\n\nThe [[Elves]] of [[Jerda'll]] are trained to fight in little to no light, and in very narrow close quarters. This training proves very useful when invading a city. Fighting atop walls and in city alleyways is actually very akin to fighting in a cave. \n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The people of [[Jerda'll]] tell stories of beings who live deep within [[The Underdark]]. Some speak of a hidden city of great beast-like people, covered in brightly colored, and vibrantly patterned fur. Each and every one of them a unique shape and size. There are similar stories of insectoid cities, or nomadic tribes of fungal beings.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Jhenbridge":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Jhenbridge\"\n---*Built atop the Ruins of Keptifer Academy, filled with ambitious minds and lost things*\n![[Jhenbridge.png]]\n\nLocated within [[Audran]], the school is an integral part of [[The University]]. [[Jhenbridge]] is an institution of the [[Arcanum]], and is famed for its accessible education. [[Jhenbridge]] is built atop the ruins of Keptifer Academy. Keptifer was a small, and private academic institution from before [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked the city, and reduced the school to rubble. It was not a very long standing school, and most saw it as a place for dangerous mages to interact out of the public's eyes. The loss of Keptifer Academy was a tragic thing for those in academic circles, however the deep bowels of Keptifer were largely left untouched. Clever academics built [[Jhenbridge]] atop these hidden treasures to protect and claim the mysterious resources deep under the city.\n\nThe school is largely comprised of beautiful stone buildings with large windows. Its campus covers a large portion of the inner city district of Charside, and it has many buildings, public squares, and gardens. Some of the buildings still bear the scars of [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack.\n\nThose who wish to learn here are allowed to do so for free in their first year. If they are successful, they may pursue a further education. Cost of tuition is based on a students promise. The better they can serve their school, the less expensive their fees. First year courses are also very low level, and they do not include the great dangers of magic. Based on this, much of the public sees the school as a pillar of the community, however skeptics think that they keep a horrible secret below the school. Students and staff have a great love for the campus. Since it is very accessible, there is a diverse group of economic classes who attend [[Jhenbridge]].\n\n## Admission\nJoining the school is quite simple. All that is required is a detailed entrance interview to determine if an individual is fit for academia. Over 90% of individuals are admitted. Upon admission, an individual can choose to take lodging and a meal token which. Both of which are very humble things. A small dorm (which is sometimes just a single bunk, small desk, and chest), as well as 2 meals per day at the dining hall which most students call *\"Bricks\"*. Many students who have the means choose to live and eat elsewhere.\n\nAfter their first year, students can apply for further education. If accepted, they will be told a billing fee based on their promise as an academic. Those who are more skilled receive lower tuitions. It is also an unofficial rule, that those of lesser means typically receive lower costs than nobles who the school can bleed for money. If a student is rejected, they can apply again for readmission the following year for a fee. They are tested by verbal examination, and if they do well they are given a tuition cost, otherwise they must try again next year.\n\n[[Jhenbridge]] is often mocked for the fact it has the lowest tuition costs to an academic institution which studies [[Arcana]]. However its education is just as valid as any other.\n\n## Leadership\nThe school is headed by The Broken Table. A council of esteemed Arcanists who have served the school for many years. There is no sole leader, but only ever 5 members to avoid ties in voting. They conduct their meetings at The Broken Table. A large stone table that was cracked during the attack on [[Audran]] by [[The Castle of Bodies]].\n\n## Members\n\n| Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| First Years | Students who are in their first, free year of education. A little under a tenth of these students will go on to higher education. Because of this, these students are largely mocked. |\n| Irons | Students who have passed their first year of education, or readmission exam, and have continued on. These students receive an iron pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Silvers | Students who have spent a few terms in Iron, and have proven themselves adept at [[Magic]]. These students receive a silver pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Golds | Students who have become [[Speakers]], or otherwise proved themselves extremely adept at [[Magic]]. These are few in number, and of the highest skill amongst students. These students receive a gold pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Arcanists | Those welcomed fully into the rank of master. These are individuals who have become the peers of their teachers, or even surpassed them. Some remain at the school to teach or study, others venture out into the world. They are given a ring of [[Mythril]], and sometimes the rings are set with various stones. It is not known publicly what the specific stones denote, but students claim that they show the unique successes of a given individual. |\n| Students | Those who receive an education. |\n| Professors | Those who wear bands of [[Mythril]], and teach students. |\n| Instructors | Promising students who wear bands of gold, and aid in the teaching of lower students. |\n| General Staff | Non academics who aid the schools day-to-day. |\n\n## Other information\n- The more prestigious sister school of [[The Brass Hall]] will occasionally head hunt more promising students from [[Jhenbridge]]. Because of this, there is a rivalry amongst the staff of both schools.\n- Very rarely a student or professor will transfer to [[Jhenbridge]]. In this case there is no examination given, and the offer to join the school usually comes with a ring.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Kalamdola":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kalamdola\"\n---The home mountain of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]].

[[Kaszu]], also known as *Father Time* bears the moral of Sagacity. His teachings and followers surround the idea of protecting the sanctity of time itself. The manipulation of Time and Fate is a thing that attracts many Arcanists. This is a threat to the balance of all things, as time is the most volatile force know to [[Sapient Beings]]. [[Kaszu]] teaches the Moral of Sagacity, specifically with respect to Time, Fate, [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]].\n\n## Depiction\nDepicted as a man of large scale with dark greying hair. He bears ornate, purple robes and has a third eye on his forehead. His eyes are typically depicted as glowing, but on occasion he is shown as missing his left eye from its socket, and/or missing a finger on his left hand. Some depict him as having more human features while others depict him as being a very large gnome-like being.\n\n## Moral\n[[Kaszu]] teaches the moral of Sagacity. The skill of showing good judgment, wisdom, and foresight. This skill is beneficial in all aspects of life, but in the scripture of [[Kaszu]] it specifically focuses on these ideas in terms of tampering with Fate and Time.\n\n[[Magic]] is a very dangerous thing, and it allows for individuals to interface and tamper with both Fate and Time. This tampering can have some of the most grave consequences, and have the capacity to effect much more than just the individual(s) who initiated it.\n\nBy the ideals of [[The Wandering Gods]], [[Gods]] cannot limit the actions of mortals unable to resist the will of a God. [[Kaszu]] allows for the usage of [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]], so long as they are done with sagacity and wisdom. Thinking ahead on all things is in the core of making wise decisions.  \n\n## Associations\n[[Kaszu]] is associated with:\n- Academics\n- [[Chronomancy]]\n- [[Incana]]\n- Fate\n- Time\n\n## Realm\nWithin [[The Unknown Realm]], [[Kaszu]]'s domain is a very tall wizards tower. There is much speculation on what marvels line its halls, as little is written about it in scripture.\n\n## Behavior\n[[Kaszu]] is said to present himself like an old gentle teacher to his followers. Giving hints of advice when a learning opportunity arises, or when mistakes are made and the chance for improvement makes its head.\n\nControversially, there are some stories of [[Kaszu]] acting like a legal judge for those who have done heinous acts, abusing the powers of [[Arcana]] and [[Incana]]. Within a grand judgement room he decides a punishment for these perpetrators. However these are mostly considered to be mere stories. \n\n## Worshipers\nMost who follow [[Kaszu]] do not do so in a reverential way as many religions do. The majority are actually academics who research [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]]. They look to his teachings for guidance and wisdom, as these forces are remarkably dangerous. His followers are know to protect [[Zol]] against the dangers these forces pose, implementing policy and enacting punishment against those who carelessly pursue the manipulation of the past and future.\n\nIt is worth noting that only about 3/4's of academics in these specific fields follow the guidance of [[Kaszu]]'s teachings. And less than 1/4 consider themselves to be even light followers of his religion. The rest chase after the powers of Fate and Time on their own moral compass alone.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Keepships":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Keepships\"\n---[[Keepships]] are unique, magical seafaring vessels of immense size. The carry small cities on their back, and seem to have a consciousness of their own. By all known magic, a keepship should not be able to stay afloat, let alone sail. The magic behind [[Keepships]] are a complete mystery to academia, and many hunt the secret to their creation. The three [[Keepships]] that were discovered were found shortly after [[The Awakening]]. Each hosts a few thousand inhabitants, and a unique culture. The ships set a course of their own, meaning the consciousness held within the ship dictates its path. The ships are known to spend their time within [[The Vast Sea]], and occasionally swing by cities so their inhabitants can conduct trade. Often when a keepship does this, many merchant boats will pull up alongside it like some strange form of a pop up market.\n\nThe ships each have their own form of governance. A **Keep Captain** rules the people, but no one can command the ships themselves. Some who hail from the keepship's claim to hear the ships voice, they talk about the ships almost as if they were small [[Gods]]. These accounts, which are shared on all of the ships, are the origin for each of their names. The ships Inhabitants claim to have heard it spoken to them. Laws are not formally placed on the ships, but the governing bodies do impose unwritten rules that the citizens are very familiar with. These rules echo what would be seen in most foreign cities. Things like murder, fraud, and thievery are outlawed. Though overall the ships rules are typically seen as very liberal.\n\nBeyond their amazing ability to sail, [[Keepships]] also posses a few other wonderous features. The first of which is a magical defense system. The consciousness of the ship can sense threats, and its cannons will fire on any hostility. They require no loading or ammunition. The ships are remarkably adept at combat too, so most threats steer clear of them. The vessels also provide accommodations like plumbing, and magical lighting. The final trait they posses is the ability to repair/grow portions of the ship in a matter of days. The Keepships will grow almost like a closing wound, or expand its size to accommodate a growing population. The latter occurs rarely, and is usually on a small scale.\n\n## The Aubrican\n![[The Aubrican.png]]\n\nThe most populated of the [[Keepships]]. The Aubrican is known for its eclectic, scrappy citizens. The ship is packed with small makeshift coffin-homes to accommodate its overgrown population. It has a loose governing power, headed by Keep Captain Sharn Swallow. Keep Captain Swallow is an old, portly human man who was able to make himself the ships leading power due to his vast economic resources as a previous life spent as a merchant. However many do not like the Keep Captain, and crime and disorder is a common occurrence on the ship. Though not all is grim on The Aubrican. Its inhabitants are known for their music and celebration. The Aubrican has a lot of parallels with [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]].\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Aubrican describe its personality as care-free, and fun loving.\n\n## The Eebezan\n![[The Eebezan.png]]\n\nThe smallest, and most orderly of the [[Keepships]]. The Eebezan is a marvel to [[Artificers]] as it is completely made of stone, yet floats as if it were of a much lighter material. Its Keep Captain, Relza Ghonne is a young and sharp minded half elven woman. She managed to strike relative order on a keepship (a thing few have achieved), and garnered the respect of many for it. The Eebezan has the most strict rules of the trio. To board the ship one must be invited, or cleared by the ships guard. Gaining citizenship is fathoms more difficult. The whole ship operates like a healthy inner-city district.\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Eebezan describe its personality as powerful, and authoritative.\n\n## The Khal Netresser\n![[The Khal Netresser.png]]\n\nThe cursed Keepship. The Khal Netresser is thought by many to be haunted, or cursed. It lives under the tyrannical rule of Keep Captain Arth K'vett, an intimidating aarakocra woman. Strange things occur on this vessel. Many wonder why its inhabitants do not flee the ship, however sociology dictates that most people fear leaving the life they know. Though some think their inability to leave is caused by something more sinister. The other [[Keepships]] fear it as when they pass each other (a rare occurrence), the other Keepships fire on The Khal Netresser.\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Khal Netresser describe its personality as haunting, eldritch, knowing, and other-worldly.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Kenku":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kenku\"\n---*Cursed Corvid*\n![[Kenku.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Kenku]] are very few in number, and some think they are merely a thing of myth. Every member of their race bears a strange curse which is detectable by [[Divination]]. This curse makes the beings natural wings ineffective for fight, and strangely removes a [[Kenku]]'s ability to form normal speech. However they have adapted a unique method of communication with the ability to perfectly mimic any sound they hear (within reason). This allows them to form speech by quoting sentences and mixing and matching heard words into coherent communication. \n\nTheir odd existence is made all the more strange by the fact that no one knows where they came from. They are dubbed a product [[Speciatum Magica]] by the fact that they all seem to bear a curse which effects their biology. Some think them descendants of early [[Aarakocra]] who tampered with dark forces, but even this is a guess at best.\n\nThey appear as corvid-like beings. They bear feathers and raven or crow like features. However they are incapable of flight. They are not often encountered, and when they are they are often mistaken for [[Aarakocra]].\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 70-110 years |\n| Height | 3'8\"-4'2\" |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Kenku]] who exist in society typically keep to the shadows, not making themselves known.\n- No one knows their origin, but many associate them with the [[Fell]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Kerketh-Academy":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kerketh Academy\"\n---Amongst [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] lies a place of true hope and light.

It is now a place where anyone can come to learn, and better their minds.\n\n## Origin\nBuilt as a supporting organization for [[The Kybis Assembly]], the ideals of the [[Alderian Rebellion]] have reshaped it to a place for the common person to make themselves into something more.\n\n## Structure\nThe large school follows the leadership of The Archmages, all who follow the leadership of The Magnate.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- The Archmages of the school act as the head professors.

Clips can only be given by Archmages. |\n| The Preceptors | The second highest level within [[Kerketh Academy]]. These individuals are researchers given resources by the academy, and act as the professors of the more entry-level classes. |\n| The Arch Mages | The highest level of academic at [[Kerketh Academy]].

Known to keep in *packs*, [[Kobolds]] are very communal beings, but typically only with other [[Kobolds]]. Their packs have a very important hierarchical structure that determines a Kobold's place socially.\n\n[[Kobolds]] are a strange race. Often compared to both [[Dragonborn]] and [[Goblins]], but still somehow very unique. The posses draconic traits, however their blood does not bare the characteristic [[Magic]] of [[Dragons]] like [[Dragonborn]] do. They also exhibit similar hierarchical behavior like [[Goblins]].\n\n[[Kobolds]] did not initially face the same prejudice as [[Goblins]]. However this changed during [[The Dragon War]]. Many (but not all) [[Kobolds]] took to serving the dragons who terrorized [[The Three Corners]]. This betrayal of [[The Three Corners]] gave [[Kobolds]] a reputation of being evil, self serving, and unintelligent. However most, if not all, [[Kobolds]] who betrayed [[The Three Corners]] died off in the late stages of [[The Dragon War]]. Those who remain in civilization are the descendants of those who did not turn their backs on society, but they are treated as if they were the betrayers themselves. This has driven many kobolds to the fraying edges of society, or from civilization entirely.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 40-100 years |\n| Height | 3'8\"-4'5\" |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Kobolds]] face a great deal of prejudice in [[The Ward]] due to their race's history during [[The Dragon War]]\n- [[Kobolds]] have a very wide range in their expected lifespan. This is because [[Kobolds]] who live outside of modern society are very wild, and accident prone.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Kosskazoka":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kosskazoka\"\n---*The City of Lights*\n![[Kosskazoka skyline.png]]\n\n[[Kosskazoka]] is a city without slumber, known for its large population and fantastically colored [[Apparatum]] lights that leverage the illuminating properties of neon gas.

[[Kosskazoka]] is a very diverse city, so there are many different career paths. Farmer, crafts person, hospitality, solider, courier, warehouse hand... The list goes on and on. One thing that is common amongst these people is they tend to stay in their lane. If they work in the industrial district, that is the world they know. People don't tend to stray far from the familiar as that is the safest option. When things go sideways in [[Kosskazoka]] it is better to be in a world where you know how to respond rather than getting caught off guard and ending up robbed, hurt, or dead. |\n| Beggars         | Social Class | Those who are without.

This is largely because of the effects of [[The Undoing]] and the strange nature of Common. No one fully understands the influences upon language, and its effect on the world. However, many academics believe it is central to understanding the nature of [[Zol]]'s history.\n\n*Each listed language has its own script. If a language has regional subsections, these regions can communicate with one another, but their dialects differ slightly. Academics expect that directly after [[The Undoing]], these regional languages were the same, but time has caused them to diverge.*\n\n## Languages of [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]:\n- Widely Spoken Languages\n\t- Common\n\t\t- The mysterious language spoken by all people after [[The Awakening]]. It is not know how this language is shared by all cultures. Those born after [[The Awakening]] needed it to be taught to them.\n\t\t- Strangely, the language seems to be able to grow to hold new words, but it remains very constant in its structure. It seems strangely impervious to the passage of time, unlike other languages. \n\t- Elvish\n\t\t- Gethsemnean Elvish\n\t\t\t- The Elven tongue spoken by elves of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] \n\t\t- Eastern Elvish\n\t\t\t- The Elven tongue spoken by elves of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Ward]].\n\t- Dwarvish\n\t\t- Moddian Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The language of [[Mod Dranor]]\n\t\t- Laen Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The Dwarven tongue of [[Laenwalde]]\n\t\t- Eastern Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The Dwarven tongue spoken by elves of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Ward]].\n\t- Human\n\t\t- Kapeshian Human\n\t\t\t- The Human language of the east\n\t\t- Laen Human\n\t\t\t- The Human language of the west\n\t- Orcish\n\t\t- Ka'thoorin Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in the east\n\t\t- Laen Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in the west\n\t\t- Ward Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in [[The Ward]]\n\t- Goblin\n\t\t- The language of goblinoids. Commonly spoken in the wilderness. Its structure is very informal so it does not have listed variants.\n\t- Giant\n\t\t- The pleasantly simplistic language of [[Giants]] and [[Firbolgs]]. Its simplicity makes it have no major regional differences.\n\t- Smallfolk\n\t\t- The language of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]]. A very slang-filled dialect. Varies from city to city, even sometimes district to district, that recording variants is a long winded effort. However at its core it is very uniform.\n\t- Changeling\n\t\t- The language of [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\t- Aarakocran\n\t\t- The language of Aarakocran. Has few words compared to other languages, and is largely based on tone of voice to denote meaning. Very hard to speak if you are not an [[Aarakocra]]. Spoken mostly in [[Reach Run]].\n- Lesser Known Languages\n\t- Witchtongue\n\t\t- A language used amongst the many differing groups of [[The Witchlands]]. Sometimes called Druidic.\n\t- Draconic\n\t\t- The language of [[Dragons]] and [[Dragonborn]]. Extremely complex, and hard to learn. If variants exist, they are not well documented.\n\t- Sunfiend\n\t\t- A rarely used language of the [[Tieflings]], similar to Damnian.\n\t\t- Due to its relationship with hell, it is not often used as many see it as taboo.\n\t- Triton\n\t\t- An uncommon dialect used by subaqueous people. The only two known places where it is used frequently are [[Abdjadan]] and [[Yoel Sundarum]]. There are slight differences in the two dialects, but it is largely negligible.\n\t- Subaqueous Hand Signs\n\t\t- A form of visual communication for usage underwater. Does not have a written equivalent. Commonly used in [[Yoel Sundarum]].\n\t- Owlin\n\t\t- The rare and sing-song language of [[Owlin]]\n\t- Beastspeech\n\t\t- The informal language of [[Beastfolk]]\n\t- Grung\n\t\t- The language of [[Grung]] tribes. Each tribe has their own different take on the language. Involves a fair bit of croaking which makes it difficult for non-Grung to speak.\n\t- Tabaxi\n\t\t- The fast-spoken language of the [[Tabaxi]].

Many celestials, who act as acolytes for different gods, all speak Seraphic. Because of this, some scholars suspect it something developed by gods for the purpose of communication between beings of this nature.\n\n## Inferences About Old Zol and Language\nMany people of [[Zol]] believe in the concept of [[The Triumvirate]]. However the diversity of [[Language]] which exists within [[Zol]] (which was catalogued during [[The Rebuilding]]) spans a wide range of dialects. Some think this is a product of [[The Undoing]], others believe they are artifacts of [[Old Zol]]. A few even believe that they were composed shortly after [[The Awakening]]. However, linguists believe this to be inaccurate. It is widely known that all people knew the language of Common, and it would not have been practical for them to devise new means of communication. If they did, it would have likely been rooted in Common. However no other language is rooted in Common as far as scholars can tell. \n\n## The First Tongue and The Old Tongue Viewed as Languages\nThere is some confusion surrounding the nature of [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] when compared to other language. Standard language carries the purpose of communication, while [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] carry immense magical power. These magical \"languages\" are not forms of communication, but are rather understood as foundational pieces of reality.\n\n[[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] are more akin to a set of names and commands rather than a spoken language.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Larkleaf":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Larkleaf\"\n---A rare plants that only grows in the shade of [[The Kodoros]].

Some of these are naturally magical metals which are highly sought after. \n\n## Types of Metal\n\nWhat follows is a list containing some of [[Zol]]'s magical metals. Magical metals are not limited to this list, but these are the most commonly referenced in academic materials.\n\n*Rarity is based on how easily acquirable it is to society. Some metals are so rare that their existence is questioned. These metals are noted as 'Mythical'*\n\n| Metal | Rarity | Properties |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Iron | Very Common | Can be inscribed with runes from the [[Ferric Alphabet]], allowing for the metal to interface with one's [[Vizir]], producing [[Iron Light]], acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fey]] |\n| Silver | Common | Acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fell]] |\n| Gold | Common | Emits radiant [[Energy]] |\n| Mythril | Rare | [[Mythril]] is an extremely strong metal that emits very potent [[Diaphanous Magic]], very culturally significant to [[Dwarves]] and their religion. Mythril is famous for its harmonious compatibility with other magical materials. |\n| Giant's Bone | Rare | Fossils of ancient [[Giants]] that can be smelted into potent metals. Properties depend on samples, but include things like: high density and low weight, elemental [[Energy]], increasing physical abilities of living creatures. Modern Giant's Bone does not posses this quality, it must be of a fossil. |\n| Dragon Scale | Rare | Scales from [[Dragons]] of at least 100 years of age. These scales can be smelted into potent metals, or incorporated into creations in their raw form. The older the Dragon the scales came from, the more rare and powerful the magic. Scales from a dragon over 500 years are very rare, and over 1000 years are extremely rare. When used correctly, dragon scale can produce immense magical effects. |\n| Adamantine | Very Rare | One of the hardest known naturally occurring substances. Extremely sought after by armorers and weapon smiths |\n| Faenite | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fey]]. Possesses strange, and untethered magic which is often called Wild Magic. |\n| Beastmetal | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fell]]. Similar to Iron in many of its properties, Beastmetal is made unique by the fact that is has been found to provoke violence in it those around it. This is most obvious on wild beasts. It also has a small range of lesser know effects such as its ability to absorb light, and things of similar nature. |\n| Dimeritium | Very Rare | A metal found in the deep [[The Underdark]]. It possesses strange antimagical abilities. Its function is understood as emitting an ever-decaying field of raw magical [[Energy]]. This disrupts other [[Magic]] exposed to the field, as well as one's connection to [[The Trinity]]. Sometimes called *Magebane*. |\n| Potentium | Very Rare | A rare metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It can be imbued with magical [[Energy]] changing the material properties and structure of the metal permanently. Doing so is a great challenge, but is extremely useful. Often used to make weapons and ammunitions. Potentium, when charged, is said to be able to influence the properties of other nearby non-magical metals. Making them more akin to their own structure temporarily. Similar to how a Loadstone can influence other metals to be magnetic. |\n| Momentium | Very Rare | A strange metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It has an amplifying effect on any momentum applied to it. Often used in Firearms and [[Skimmers]]. |\n| Meteoric Shard | Extremely Rare | Foreign metal of cosmic origin. Suspected to be sourced from meteorites from [[The Cosmos]]. Only found within the western sands of [[Saen]] and The Ghalt Kratur of [[The Witchlands]]. All recovered shards are of a common material, but each recorded use of their application produces a unique magical effect. Little is understood about Meteoric Shards |\n| Seraphium | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. It has immense magical properties. Many holy relics are comprised of Seraphium. Its properties cover a wide spectrum, but it is know to produce wonderous magic, strength, durability, and energetic capacity. |\n| Void Slag | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Void]]. It's unholy status, and unpredictable effects have secured it a special place in myth and academia. Those have tampered with it have said it is extremely difficult to work with, and produces *undesirable* effects. |\n| Hag Metal | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in folklore regarding [[Hags]]. Said to be so toxic, that touching it can cause it to absorbed through the skin, forever changing a person. There are a small collection of mythical weapons said to be made from it. |\n| Morhin | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in religious texts regarding [[The Wandering Gods]], said to be so desirable even gods seek it out. |\n\n## Potentium Sub-Metals\nWhen Potentium is exposed to a high concentration of elemental [[Energy]], its alchemical structure and magical properties can be permanently altered. Once altered, it cannot be altered again, or alloyed with any known metal. It is even possible to infuse Potentium with multiple types of elemental [[Energy]] to create hybrids, given you expose it to the correct energy concentrations simultaneously.\n\nThe Potentium Sub-Metals are:\n\n| # | Name | Elemental Energy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ignitium | Fire |\n| 2 | Fridigite | Cold |\n| 3 | Excitium | Lightning |\n| 4 | Necrodite | Necrosis |\n| 5 | Radallium | Radiant |\n| 6 | Toxium | Poison |\n| 7 | Corrodium | Acid |\n\nHybrids between Potentium Sub-Metals are extremely difficult to make. They are often called by their elemental numbers. Potentium exposed to lightning and radiant [[Energy]] in the correct concentrations becomes *III-IV Potentium*.\n\n## Other information\n- [[Artificers]] often refer to [[Magical Metals]] as *Strong* metals. This isn't in reference to their physical strength (however, many magical metals are quite strong which is known to further confusion amongst non-academics). It is instead in reference to their strong magical potential. Non-magical metals such as tin, zinc, and mercury are referred to as Weak Metals. These names are reflected in the [[Ferric Alphabet]] table.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Malevolan":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Malevolan\"\n---*To Know*\n![[Malevolan.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Malevolan]] worship is a denomination of religion used to describe any faith that follows a dark entity, typically the [[Void Gods]].

He has lived like this for over 2 dozen years and will likely live another decade.*\n\n## Cause\nMateriation occurs when a complex [[Iron Light]] [[Apparatum]] involves an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. Using these devices is hard on one's physical body. The exact reason for its occurrence is unknown.\n\n## Symptoms\nWhile frightening to observers, the affliction is described casually by its victims. While fatal, the afflicted claim to enjoy the experience as it makes them feel one with the world.\n\nThe ailment seems to give its victims a unique wisdom, euphoria, as well as a slight disconnect from society.\n\nWhile fatal, the condition progresses slowly and is not accelerated by continued usage of dangerous [[Apparatum]]. Many afflicted live relatively normal lives ten to fifty years beyond diagnosis.\n\nThe bodies of the afflicted strangely continue to function even without vital organs that are removed or damaged by the disease. It is only fatal when it takes the brain or a vital section of spine.\n\nEven after death the corpses of the afflicted continue to materiate. There is no cure for Materiation.\n\n## Additional Information\nBeings with artificial bodies have a high resistance to [[Materiation]].

It was discovered in the early 4th millennium.\n\nIt is the process of creating an [[Apparatum]] so complex, a soul bonds to it via [[The Mortal Coil]]. Originally discovered by accident when [[Artificers]] were attempting to develop a [[Low Automata]] pen that could act as a scribe for someone who was dictating to it. When the pen began writing of its own volition, a massive surge of innovation began. The pen is now known as \"Professor Quill\" and can still be found within [[The University]]'s artificary.\n\nA subservient race of beings called [[Warforged]] were developed to originally fight in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. This accelerated the conflict from both sides significantly. The destruction that could be committed by forces of soldiers that did not need sleep not sustenance was immense. The mass production of combat ready [[Warforged]] was stopped when some of them began to be damaged in specific ways that gave them free will.\n\nThese [[Warforged]] would then go on to damage other [[Warforged]], causing a chain reaction. Drastic measures had to be taken to destroy the rouge constructs, and it became known that using [[Warforged]] in large numbers was not strategically viable.\n\nSoon after slaves began to be replaced by the much more efficient mechanical counterpart. The name [[Warforged]] stuck even though they were longer just used for battle.\n\nNo one knows exactly how [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] works. The phenomenon poses an unending list of academic and philosophical questions [[Zol]] has yet to answer.\n\n## Limitations to Mechanicum Immaculatum\n[[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is a strange, and complex phenomena that is hard to measure. Nine times out of ten a being who experiences [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] dies within seconds of coming to life. It is not known why this is, but it makes creating [[Warforged]] a major challenge and a huge time investment.\n\nSapient beings created through [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] can be made with physical or magical abilities, however there seems to be diminishing returns with the powers invested into them during their creation. It is very difficult to create a [[Warforged]] that is as powerful as a master of martial arts, or a well trained arcanist. However their power can increase after they gain a soul in the same way other living creatures can.\n\nStrangely, [[Apparatum]] created by [[Warforged]] cannot undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]. This means [[Warforged]] cannot reproduce on their own. It is not known why this is.\n\n## Low Automata\nIt is common for individuals to get confused between [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] giving life to [[Warforged]], and the complex manufacturing of [[Low Automata]]. Low Automata are simplistic beings crafted through [[Magic]] that exist similarly to [[Warforged]]. However [[Low Automata]] do not have a true soul bound to them, and therefore do not undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Metallic-Dragons":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Metallic Dragons\"\n---See [[Dragons]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Mimics":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Mimics\"\n---[[Mimics]], also called *Ayadon'ae* by the [[Changelings]] are a species of beings who hail from [[The Glassius Reach]].

Beyond that, ancient mimics are immensely powerful.\n\n## Origin\nMimics are incredibly secretive beings. Most of what is known about them is drawn from legend and speculation. It is said that the first generation of [[Mimics]] were stones animated by some force. There are those who believe they were made by the [[Gods]], others think them a product of [[The Oldshards]]. There are myths of them being holy protectors of something ancient, and there are those of them being dangerous monsters from [[The Void]].\n\nIn either case, they are said to be born in generations. The First Generation of [[Mimics]] were granted immense [[Magic]] which allowed them to create other mimics. Each generation with slightly different powers. Though it is said that only the first was capable of creating other [[Mimics]]. Academics believe that the older a Mimic is, the more intelligent and powerful it is. Making each generation slightly less powerful as a product of time.\n\nMost modern day [[Mimics]] that are encountered are more akin to beasts, or simplistic monsters. They spend long periods of time pretending to be objects that devour prey when they get close. Though there are accounts of ancient mimics being encountered, who are all extremely dangerous and intelligent.\n\n## Society\nLegends speak of a secret society of [[Mimics]] within [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Some say that they live in dark caves, others believe that they have a city of their own. There are no formal records of this place. In Glassian Lore, this place is called *Mastara*.\n## Physiology\n[[Mimics]] have complete control over the physiology. They can change their body to any size and shape. However the larger they are, the more food they need to sustain themselves.\n\nYounger generations of [[Mimics]] must remain completely still for their forms to be convincing, but later generations can do wonderous feats like making themselves appear as living things.\n## Relationship to The Oldshards\nThe few encounters that have been recorded with the earlier generations of [[Mimics]] describe some fascination, or reverence with [[The Oldshards]]. It is not known why they orbit around their locations.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Topics":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Miscellaneous Topics\"\n---*This is an index of various topics which quite relevant to the world, but are either tucked away deep within the pages, or do not have a proper home.

He focuses primarily on the defense of [[Zol]] from the dangers of [[The Void]], but does maintain the natural order of the sea.

This is because those of [[The Void]] seek to return [[Zol]] to its primordial form known as the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The Ocean itself was created by [[Ohlit]] as a border between [[Zol]] and [[The Void]]. \n\nAt the greatest depths of [[Zol]] exists fissures that lead into [[The Void]]. The Ocean covers many of these fissures and allows [[Ohlit]] to monitor anything that may try to bridge the gap between worlds.\n\nThe Sea-God sends armies of his creation to war against [[The Void]] in an endless effort to hold back the evils that lurk deep beneath [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Old-Zol":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Old Zol\"\n---The highly advanced civilization of [[Zol]] that existed in [[The Before]].

A world worth protecting. [[Persanius]] is said to be a being creation. His scripture speaks of him making both art and machine in an attempt to better understand the universe itself. He teaches the moral of Compassion. In his scripture it is said beyond ones self, an individual acts and experiences the world through the tools and artistry. Tools and art are product of people, when one learns to view the world through this precise lens wisdom like no other can be found.\n\n## Depiction\nSaid to appear as an aged human man with a bald head and a long grey beard. Some depict him as wearing armor that is said to appear as if it was painted on reality itself, while others believe that his armor and tools are a swarm of tiny machines that assemble themselves in infinite configurations at his will, some even depict him as having a missive set of butterfly wings. He is also said to wear an array of rings on his hands.\n\n## Moral\n[[Persanius]] teaches the moral of Compassion. The wisdom of understanding another hardship, and treating them with kindness in turn. To find and understand ones darkness is a great challenge, and filling that void with light even more so. Overcoming this challenge can effect the world of [[Sapient Beings]] with immeasurable benefit. \n\n## Associations\n[[Persanius]] is associated with:\n- Academia\n- [[Artificers]]\n- Art\n\n## Realm\n[[Persanius]] is said to reside within a grand strange machine within [[The Unknown Realm]]. It is a sprawling and strange structure of an unknown purpose.\n\n## Behavior\n[[Persanius]] has a reputation of maintaining an impassive demeanor. Never raising his voice, or exercising wrath. He aims to maintain that action is carried out compassionately. If an individual is cruel, he teaches the asking of questions like: can that cruelty be understood, and maybe even overcome? He is known to interact with those who are already very compassionate, or could use a compassionate influence in their life.\n\n## Worshipers\nThose who follow [[Persanius]] are know to be very thoughtful individuals, and are often pacifists. They seek not to avoid conflict, but circumvent it. Within [[Persanius]]' scripture it is clearly written that violence itself is not evil, but it is the final choice. Those who follow his message carry this very closely to heart.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Pheridian":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Pheridian\"\n---*Ensharden Nedrahsne*\n![[Pheridian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Pheridian]] belief is often defined by some as an [[Obscuran]] religion. While true by some definitions, [[Pheridian]] belief is one of the larges religious denominations that is not a Zolaen-Centric, or Trinity-Centric belief system. It is based in worship of [[The Oldshards]]. Two ancient and mysterious relics with magical properties like nothing else. [[The Apex]] and [[The Vertex]]. [[Pheridian]] belief sees [[The Oldshards]] as perfect objects. Two things which strike order amongst the chaos of [[Zol]].\n\nThe true nature of [[The Oldshards]] is not known, but it is written in [[Pheridian]] scripture that they were once understood by Pre-Undoing [[Changelings]]. [[Pheridian]] belief idealizes the concept of rediscovering [[The Oldshards]]. Only through this understanding can order be made of a chaotic world.\n\n## Values\n- [[The Oldshards]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n- [[Changelings]]\n- [[The Pattern]]\n- [[Pure Form]]\n- Pure Voice\n- [[True Form]]\n- [[Shardcallers]]\n- Singing\n- [[Form Art]]\n- Symmetry\n- Perfection\n- Order\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Oldshards]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\n[[Pheridian]] scripture believes that [[Goh'zul]], while destructive and terrible, was a collector of great things. He would scour the cosmos, accumulating pieces of the universe within himself. These things swirled within his infinite form. Together they blended and merged into a wonderous, and chaotic mess. The world of [[Zol]]. This interaction within [[Goh'zul]]'s body killed him, but [[Zol]] grew from his remains.\n\n[[Goh'zul]] collected many things. Forces, [[Gods]], and objects of immense power. Each one a marvel in its own right. However, only 2 objects stood out as perfect. [[The Oldshards]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Pheridian]] scripture tells of ancient people being advanced and peaceful. [[Pheridian]] belief rejects the theory of the [[Triumvirate]]. It is thought that ancient [[Changelings]] had a comprehensive understanding of [[The Oldshards]] before [[The Undoing]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Pheridian]] scripture does not give a cause for [[The Undoing]]. It actually claims that attempting to infer that information is heretical. It instead believes that the true cause of [[The Undoing]] is information that is actually stored within [[The Oldshards]]. It is only to be known when that information is dispensed by them.\n\n## Church Structure\nThe church within [[Pheridian]] belief are unique as they also serve as places of education. It is an organization known as [[The Eelynn]]. Leading these organizations is handled by **Shardwitnesses**. **Shardwitnesses** are much more than just clergy within [[The Glassius Reach]], as they are also scholars, politicians, tacticians, and things of the like. However, some **Shardwitnesses** bear the responsibility of leading their people in faith. They do bear a hierarchy within [[The Eelynn]], however there are not titles associated with rank. All leaders are simply known as **Shardwitnesses**, but rank is a carefully determined structure done based on the individuals within the organization.\n\nEach Glassian city has its own manifestation of [[The Eelynn]], with its own organizational structure.\n\n### Notable Organizations\n- [[The Eelynn]]\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief focuses on the idea living ones life in an orderly way. Each person's life has its own unique shape and the process of strengthening one's faith involves finding how that shape fits into [[The Pattern]]. Modernist belief sees [[The Pattern]] as more of a suggestion rather than a set of distinct rules.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief consists of very strict adherence to [[The Pattern]]. It is believed by these individuals that more information about [[The Oldshards]] can only be found through devotion to [[The Pattern]]. Straying from [[The Pattern]] is a sin in the eyes of a Fundamentalist.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Pheridian]] religion was significantly harmed during the [[Western War]] when [[The Apex]] was lost. This has caused much uproar within [[Pheridian]] belief and the effects are still at the core of this great loss.\n- [[Pheridian]] belief sees other [[Gods]] merely as powerful entities, not divinity. They are to be respected, but not worshiped.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Pirates":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Pirates\"\n---Those who ascribe to the lawless nature of the seas.

A plane which contains many other planes all anchored to a [[Prime Material Plane]]. The sheer number of planes in [[Zol]] is not known. Planar travel poses many challenges, and most mortals know little of anything outside the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Despite this, the powerful and arcane citizens of [[Zol]] have recorded a fair deal about the [[Planes]].\n\n![[Diagram of the cosmos.png]]\n\n[[Planes]] were first created from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. [[The Watcher]] did not transform the majority of the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]], but did manage to harness a great deal of it. What is left of the [[Sea of Monsters]] is now known as [[The Void]].\n\nAll planes in [[Zol]] are are anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]], which is the resting place of [[The Trinity]], and home to [[The Three Corners of Civilization]].\n\nAll planes float amongst [[The Ethos]], the local section of the universe that stops at [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Beyond that lies [[The Cosmos]] which spans on forever.\n\n## List of All Planes\nThere are many planes in [[Zol]]. Below is the list of known major planes.\n- **The Mortal Planes** - Planes bound by the rule of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[Prime Material Plane]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Zol]] and resting place of [[The Trinity]]. Being the source of all magical power, and the anchor for all other planes, it is the focal point for all of [[Zol]]. Often referred to as the anchor realm.\n\t- [[Fey]]\n\t\t- A fantastical reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where nature an beauty run rampant. While enticing, the [[Fey]] is very dangerous.\n\t- [[Fell]]\n\t\t- A dark and mysterious reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where shadows and thorns grow from a hauntingly beautiful, and extremely dangerous landscape.\n\t- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\t\t- The fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], where the elemental forces of nature stop overlapping one another. Appearing on diagrams like the drawing of a child who has colored outside of the lines. [[The Elemental Planes]] jut out of the [[Prime Material Plane]] creating worlds that solely embody a single aspect of nature. They are strange realms rarely traversed by foreigners.\n\t- - [[The Moons]]\n\t\t- A group of ancient planets that once existed freely in [[The Cosmos]], but were consumed by [[Goh'zul]]. Before he could fully digest them, he was defeated. Leaving a set of strange ruined worlds that orbit one another in [[Zol]]'s sky.\n\t\t- [[The Forgotten Heavens]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Moons]]. The once abandoned divine plane attached to these ancient worlds. Now inhabited by [[The Night Empress]] and her court. **This plane itself is not on the mortal coil.**\n- **The Outer Planes** - Planes that are not bound by [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]\n\t\t- The Castle of [[The Watcher]] and his close allies\n\t- [[The Palace of Drole]]\n\t\t- An endless palace inhabited by [[Yanneran]] and his chosen dead. A place of constant celebration and art.\n\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t- Where the fateless dead are sent by [[The Coilwalker]] to have their future determined.\n\t- [[Absurdia]]\n\t\t- One of the most bizarre aspects of [[Zol]]. It is described as a sort of parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Its inhabitants are very odd, and those that travel to it tell tales of strange events that almost sound like comical children's stories mixed with accounts of great violence.\n\t- [[The Unknown Realm]]\n\t\t- The home of [[The Wandering Gods]]\n\t- [[The Immortal Ocean]]\n\t\t- A realm of only water and light, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant. Accessible only to those who are not invited by its ruler [[Ohlit]].\n\t- [[The Pure Forest]]\n\t\t- A beautiful infinitely spanning forest brought into existence by [[The Lifeweaver]]'s presence, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant.\n\t- [[Elm Manor]]\n\t\t- The artificial plane constructed by [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].\n\t- [[The Storm Horizon]]\n\t\t- The origin of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s storms.\n- **Unique Planar Manifestations** - Planes, or things very similar to planes, that have their own set of rules that is unique to them.\n\t- [[The Void]]\n\t\t- The Remnants of the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The size and scope of [[The Void]] is not know by even the [[Gods]]. It exists directly underneath the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It contains evils incomprehensible to mortals, and is only held back by the efforts of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t\t- [[Damnation]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Void]]. It is an amalgamation of all hells ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], and is ruled by the terrifying demon [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is accessible in the deepest darkest caverns that span at the bottom of [[The Underdark]].\n\t- [[The Ethos]]\n\t\t- The space that surrounds all of [[Zol]]'s planes. It is essentially the lack of a plane. The whole universe exists floats amongst this manifestation of reality, [[The Ethos]] is merely the local section of it.\n\t\t- [[The Ethos]] is also bound by [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- [[The Cosmos]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Ethos]] and [[The Great Wall of Roots]].\n\t- [[The Ethereal Plane]]\n\t\t- Not truly a plane at all. Some call it The Cognitive Realm, others call it The Plane of Souls. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is the wavelength of reality that souls exist on. It overlaps all of [[Zol]]. It is possible to interface directly with [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even travel through it.\n\t- [[Oblivion]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Goh'zul]]. Little is known about [[Oblivion]]. Scripture talks of it being the battle ground between [[The Watcher]] and [[The Wretch]]. It is said to have a sole entrance called simply *The Door*, and is thought to still contain what little is left of [[Goh'zul]].\n\t- [[The Space Outside Reality]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Cosmos]]. Also known as The Far Realm.\n\n## Subplanes\nSubplanes are planes that are created within another plane. They inherit all the rules their parent plane subscribes to.\n\nExample: [[Artificers]] create the common [[Apparatum]] known as a Bag of Holding. This device is a fabric sac that contains a portal to an artificial plane that merely contains space for storing objects. If this Bag of Holding is brought to the [[Prime Material Plane]] the space inside the bag is bound to [[The Mortal Coil]], if it is brought to [[Absurdia]] it is not.\n\n## The Two Types of Planes: Planets and Realms\nA planet is a discrete, usually spherical plane that floats freely amongst [[The Cosmos]]. [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] are a good example of this. Planets typically have some central point of gravity that keeps objects on its surface. Planets do not usually have other planes bound to them in any way other than gravitational orbit of other planets.\n\nRealms are planes that are not necessarily discrete and do not have to subscribe to Euclidean Geometry. They may be infinite, repeating/fractal, or end abruptly at their edges.\n\nIn [[The Cosmos]], Parent realms are usually discerned by some sort of barrier between them and the rest of the universe. They typically contain many lesser planes bound to a [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as their own local section of [[The Cosmos]] similar to [[The Ethos]]. \n\nAs an example: [[Zol]] is the parent realm, [[The Prime]] is the anchor realm, as the majority of planes within [[Zol]] are directly bound to it. Its barrier is [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. The local part of the universe within that barrier is known as [[The Ethos]].\n\nPlanets can exist on their own or within a realm. Realms are rarely contained by a planet, but Realms usually contain other realms.\n\n## Artificial Planes\nPlanes that are not found already existing in [[Zol]] are called Artificial Planes. They are newly created, and typically temporary in the cosmic scale.\n\nThey can manifest at any size and can be produced intentionally or by wild magic. The can exist as planets or realms.\n\nConstructing a plane intentionally is very difficult and requires immense skill. The size, specifications, and permanency of the plane depends on the ability of the creator.\n\nA good example of this is the plane of [[Elm Manor]], home to [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].

Most people treat them as ordinary citizens of [[Zol]], but some pick and choose which racial backgrounds to acknowledge in order to justify their mistreatment of them.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Ralatas-Prince-of-Beasts":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ralatas, Prince of Beasts\"\n---*Wayward God of Beasts and the Hunt, Major Deity*\n![[Ralatas prince of beasts.png]]\n\nLord of the forest, god of claw and fang, master of the hunt. Ralatas the prince of beast reigns as the powerful overseer of the harsh wilds, and those who make a home in it.\n\nTaking his throne from his father, Ralatas is the successor of the mad [[Kerndall, the Feral King]].\n\n## Depiction\nRalatas is depicted as an elegant beast, adorned in a floral crown. Most famously taking the form of a massive wolf, Ralatas is also know to be seen as a god-like form of any beast.\n\n## Symbolism\nA single fang with three dots arranged in a triangle.\n\n## Behavior\nRalatas is known for maintaining the natural chaos that nature provides. A place without the laws and the systems of mortals. He seeks to keep as much of [[Zol]] as he can unbound, allowing the natural laws of nature to unfold.\n\nIs known to be amicable to [[The Lifeweaver]].\n\n## Realm\nResides in [[The Pure Forest]], the same realm as [[The Lifeweaver]]. Ralatas is known to spend much of his time in a rock formation and series of caves that resembles a castle some-what. \n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of Ralatas are usually mystics, druids, tribes, and other social oddities. Formal worship is not practiced. Relations with Ralatas manifest more as a way of life involving hunts, and spending most of ones time in the natural world.\n\n## State of Princedom\nRalatas succeeded his father [[Kerndall]] when the once king attempted to expand his domain by converting society to beasts. He did so by accidentally manufacturing a disease called [[Beast Ire]]. A condition that caused madness and mutations. Converting mortals into feral beasts who hunted their own kin. Devouring hundreds and spreading the disease to others.\n\nThe disease eventually mutated in such a way where it could infect beasts as well. Causing them to take on horrifying forms. [[Kerndall]] was forced to contain the ailment within himself to save [[Zol]]. Maddening him and turning him into a horrible monster now under the control of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\nRalatas will not take the title of king until his father has been slain.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Rello-Arr":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Rello Arr\"\n---A [[Kapesh]] city destroyed in the peak of the [[Triumvirate Battles]].

A hole in armor reforms in a few days, a wheel on a cart is round again in a week, and a shattered sword can be pieced back together with care. This makes for a very desirable material. It was harvested extensively during the [[First Age]]. Its veins would slowly restore themselves, but be quickly remined. This made for little of the resource in the ground, but a slow drip of profit from what was found.\n\nWhen [[Iron Light]] was discovered, the value of [[Rift Iron]] skyrocketed. However, its slow regrowth made it difficult to get. On top of that, once [[Rift Iron]] is tempered, you cannot change its shape, making any material already used useless for [[Artificers]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Rift-Lung":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Rift Lung\"\n---See [[Rift Smog]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Rift-Smog":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Rift Smog\"\n---A toxic off-gas produced by the regrowth of [[Rift Iron]].

It often produces other sickness as well since it reduces the body's natural defenses. These sickness are often what causes death for those who suffer from [[Rift Lung]].\n\n[[Artificers]] of [[Tenzentak]] were able to create massive filters that remove the necrotic properties from the gas using the radiant properties of sunlight.

The kingdom's religious doctrine has made an exception in the case of [[Daetro]]'s followers, as the minor god has a very kind demeanor and cares for his people.

The Fire God [[Daetro]] resides within the neighboring volcano, [[Mount Zerstel]]. A god residing on [[The Mortal Coil]] risks a great deal, but it allows [[Daetro]] to have a very close relationship with his followers. [[Daetro]] is only a minor god, but his power is still tremendous. His influence allows for the people of the city to live plentiful lives, and learn about the nature of [[Gods]] in a unique manner. However [[Daetro]]'s influence stops at the borders of the city's territory              |\n| Main Challenge           | A being of such power and influence maintaining such a close and personal relationship with a city creates many unique opportunities. Sometimes it is very difficult navigating these opportunities as a mortal. [[Daetro]] does not give everything to his people. One of his core ideals is strength of self, he encourages this through perseverance through hardship. Another challenge is those who posses different beliefs feel pressured or even ostracized by the presence of a god so near to the city. Some have even gone as far as attempting to dismantle the systems and infrastructure that support [[Daetro]]'s worship. |\n| Climate                  | Desert/Tropical

Politically the crown rules the city, but even the king knows forcing the city one way or another is a tricky gambit. [[Daetro]] allows for the crowns presence within the city, but sees the city as his own.[[Daetro]] would protect the city, but would never fight on the crown's behalf.\n\n## Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nKnown by outsiders as a devout and mythical place, home to a strange and benevolent god. A place where mortals attempt to acquire an understanding of the [[Gods]] who rule over [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nRockfire has not changed much over its existence. It is one of the oldest city's in [[The Three Corners]]. Built by nomads who discovered [[Daetro]], and never conquered due to the god's protection.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- There are no slaves within [[Rockfire]], legally they are allowed by the crown, but [[Daetro]]'s cultural influence has pushed away the practice entirely. Those who bring their slaves to the city are said to meet grim accidents.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.338015158Z","tags":null},"/Sand-Cows":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Sand Cows\"\n---Massive hairy cows who eat cacti and produce palatable milk which man of [[The Kulpis Desert]] use for hydration.

A terrible product of the vast power differences that exist in [[Zol]]*\n![[mask of iron.png]]\n\nSlavery is a dark stain on [[Zol]]'s history and society. It was first spawned shortly after [[The Awakening]]. Many of those who made early grabs at power implemented the practice as an unjust way to accelerate their ascension. By enslaving their enemies, criminals, and others they had a negative perception of, they were able to accomplish feats of civilization and conquest that would have been otherwise unattainable. However, the free labor they had invested in had other grave costs that were paid in blood.\n\nSlaves were known to rebel and kill their masters regularly. In a world where power can be drawn from [[The Trinity]] by even the most oppressed mind, the concept of owning another is a sure way to secure a dark fate. However this did not stop the greedy powers of the world. A constant, distributed war between slaves and slavers has been waged all across [[Zol]], and all throughout its history. The most notable events of it being the [[Alderian Rebellion]] and the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\nSlowly but surely, those oppressed have been gaining ground on those who would control them. The most horrible of practices conducted by those in power have lessened more and more, as it has always pushed slaves to violence. Slaves now receive a sort of *expected* treatment which is considerably less horrible than the slaves who had suffered long ago. This sadly does not mean they lead pleasant lives. Those in power know pushing them to their limit is extremely dangerous, and instead attempt to walk the line. It also helps that public opinion, especially in the east, has changed in favor of the slaves. Many slaves serve a long sentence, rather than being permanently kept at the status. This makes it so they see the light at the end of the tunnel, and undisruptive slaves reach the light sooner. This horrible, manipulative practice structures the current landscape of slavery.\n\nThe status and behavior of slaves is denoted by the mask they wear. All slaves wear one of the following masks:\n- **Mask of Wood** - A common worker slave. These individuals work in lumber yards, mines, shipping yards, and things of the like. Known to keep their head down, and serve out their sentence. These slaves are often nicknamed *Splints*. Which is a shortening of their older nickname *Splinters*, in reference to their wooden masks.\n- **Mask of Porcelain** - A servant of the upper class. These individuals act similarly as paid help, and are often associated with good behavior. Their masks are often designed to look stylish, and most often do not cover the whole face. Some slaves of this status are treated considerably well, and sometimes even become beloved members of the houses they work at. It is seen as a mercy on the surface, but when looking at it more closely one can see the dark horrible manipulations beneath its shallow surface. These slaves are often called *Doll Masks* or *Chips*, based on the wear and tear their delicate masks receive.\n- **Mask of Iron** - Dangerous slaves. Those who have exhibited violence during their time behind a mask of wood or porcelain. These slaves are very rare, as the actions that would earn one a mask of iron usually result in imprisonment or execution. However sometimes the slave posses a useful trait, or they receive this as a sick punishment. These slaves are often given the most dangerous, and grueling jobs. This group is usually called *Iron Masks* or *Blood Masks*.\n\n*Slavery is included in [[Zol]] as an injustice for the characters to overcome. I, as the author feel strongly about the injustice of forcing another person to do something against their will, and/or taking away their freedoms. Any instance of slavery in a story within [[Zol]] is meant as an obstacle for the heroes to overcome. Any character who owns, or perpetuates [[Slavery]] is meant to be seen as an antagonist. There are no exceptions. No inclusion of slavery is meant to reflect real world events, or peoples and their experiences. One also does not need to include this concept to tell a story within this world if they do not wish to. For further explanation of the inclusion of such a dark concept in the world, I encourage you to read the [[Disclaimer]].*","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/Speakers":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Speakers\"\n---Those who know at least a small portion of [[The Old Tongue]].

[[Teleportation Circles]] are magical constructions utilized by Casters as a both a destination and origin for their teleportations. Teleporting is an extremely temperamental and dangerous thing when simply from moving to one place to another. This is magnified by the distance travelled. However, if one can be familiarized with their origin and destination, it becomes many degrees easier. [[Teleportation Circles]] are constructed to emit very loud and specific informational [[Energy]] signatures. Magic users will memorize themselves with these signatures, greatly reducing the chance for error, and increasing their range.\n\nThe designs of teleportation circles are often mistaken for [[Iron Light]] or [[Iszertion]], however they are neither of these things. They are merely unique patterns created with magical materials, such as [[Chalkstone]], to serve as a landing point. Their circular shape is use for efficiency due to a property of the mathematics surrounding informational [[Energy]]. The informational [[Energy]] signature that they emit quickly degrades, unless the circle is regularly redrawn in the same place. Once it has been redrawn for about 380 to 420 days (about a year) it becomes permanent. This is a result of [[Nodes]] being left in a constant state for so long, they have trouble reverting to their old state, like a leather shoe that has been stretched to fit ones foot perfectly.\n\nAll circles are unique, it is possible to draw a circle exactly like another, but its location will cause it have a different signature. A circle must be known by a [[Caster]] for them to use it. This can be known by physically seeing it and memorizing it, or by viewing diagrams and the supporting geographical information. Because of the logistics of defense and fraud, teleportation circles are well kept secrets. The chambers that hold them are deep under well guarded buildings, usually city keeps, and have many clever defenses. Not all are the same, and some even have no defenses. However most follow a common pattern.\n\nFirstly, they are always surrounded by armed guard. Going in and out of the facility that contains the circle requires individuals to pass through a security checkpoint. The room itself is also armed with magical traps and illusions in case a hostile force were to invade it. There are also set mechanisms in the room to destroy the circle if it ever becomes a threat. Lastly, illusions of light and fog cover the floors of the room to obfuscate the shape of the teleportation circle. Only specific and accredited [[Caster]]s are allowed access to the index of shared teleportation circles across all major cities.\n\nThese shared teleportation circles are called Convergences. Most cities have a Convergence, and some even have more than one. A city many not have a convergence if they lack the magical influences required, and some do not share theirs with the outside world such as [[Yorn et Gaul]] and [[Corinth]]. Many more private teleportation circles exist, but these are not publicly known in the same way as Convergences.\n\nTeleportation leverages complex [[Conjuration]] magic, and it must be conducted by skilled [[Caster]]. Because of the logistics, time invested into education, convivence, and the low number of people who can perform teleportation, it is very expensive to hire someone who can teleport you.\n\n*For more information on Teleportation, see [[Conjuration]]*","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/Tellab-the-Wise":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Tellab, the Wise\"\n---*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*\n![[Tellab The Wise.png]]\n\nHe who understands all and seeks for others to do the same.

These powers allow a normal person to transform into a massive and powerful titan, capable of incredible feats of strength and destruction. No one knows the origin of this power, but it all revolves around a single individual called The Crux.\n\nThe Crux is a genetic power, passed down through generations. One member of each generation gains the powers of The Crux. The Crux's sole abilities are the capacity to choose champions to become titans, and the ability to tap into a titans senses. Some think that The Crux also has increased physical abilities, and maybe even their own titan form, but this is rumor at best. The Titans are all loyal to The Crux, save for the occasional aberrant soul.\n\nTitans are bound by a few rules. It takes a great deal of power to enter their titan form, and can only do so every few days at best. Staying in their form is difficult, and most can only remain as a titan for so long.  If a titan dies, The Crux can make a new titan of the same type after the refractory period it would take for that titan to be able to retake its form. No more of one titan type can exist at a time. Each titan also has a weakness unique to them, and being made titan shortens ones lifespan by over half. Becoming a titan grants one amazing physical power, but the power of a titan is ultimately based on the initial skill of a person before they are made titan.\n\nThe titans are as follows:\n\n## The Blade Titan\n![[The Blade Titan.png]]\n\nThe Blade Titan is the smallest of the Titans. It stands at about 15 feet tall, and possesses the ability to grow bladed weapons out of its skin. It is an extremely adept fighter with these weapons, and can remain in titan form for nearly a full day. Its weapons are extremely useful to it, however its strangely weak to the material its blades are made from. When not in the hand of The Blade Titan, its weapons degrade into nothing within a matter of minutes.\n\n## The Burning Titan\n![[The Burning Titan.png]]\n\nThe Burning Titan is an extremely hard being to kill. It is quite large at about 30 feet tall. The difficulty in killing The Burning Titan comes from the extreme heat it emits. The longer it is in its titan form, the hotter it burns. After about half an hour, merely standing near it singes flesh, making it nearly impossible to approach. However, its burning is its own weakness. The heat quickly destroys its titan form, and is return back to a normal person after only an hour of fighting.\n\n## The Power Titan\n![[The Power Titan.png]]\n\nThe Strongest of the titans. Despite its relatively short size of 25 feet, The Power Titan is the physically strongest of the titans. Some think The Power Titan is the most dangerous of the titans. This is amplified by the fact its weakness is not publicly known, and that it can stay in its titan form indefinitely.\n\nDuring The [[Alderian Rebellion]], The Power Titan betrayed [[Kapesh]] and fought for the side of the rebels. No one knows exactly what brought the titan at the time to do so, but it killed the other titans dozens of times before their death. Its sacrifice was one of the major reasons for the rebels victory until [[Deepspell]] and their mages joined the rebels side.\n\n## The Sinew Titan\n![[The Sinew Titan.png]]\n\nArguably the most deadly titan. The Sinew Titan's horrifying appearance is one of twisted, grey muscle fibers, and a toothy maw. It stand 50 feet tall, and has many long tendrils coming off of its body. It is likely the most frail of the titans, as its weakness is at each of its main joints. However its long reach given by its very precise control of its tendrils allows it to level forests and armies. Unfortunately for it, The Sinew Titan has a refractory period of many months. It can stay in its form for about 2 hours.\n\n## The Towering Titan\n![[The Towering Titan.png]]\n\nThe largest, and most feared of the titans. The Towering Titan is a rare sight on any battle field as it has a refractory period of nearly a year. However its massive size, and blasts of burning light it can shoot from its eyes make it a terrifying foe. The Towering Titan stands about 140 feet tall. Its weakness lies deep beneath the flesh on the back of its neck. It is also very dangerous as when it enters its form, it unleashes a destructive blast that can level buildings. Rumor claims that sometimes entering this form kills the host, and The Crux has to control its body. The Towering Titan can stay in this form for up to 2 hours.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Cult-of-the-Mothers":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Cult of the Mothers\"\n---A dangerous and mysterious cult of the witches who betrayed [[The Coven]].

This is why transportation like [[Trains]] and [[Airships]] were so revolutionary.\n\nThe dangers of the wild are what caused the cities to become what they are, massive bastions of safety with large populations. It is also why there are huge distances between cities. Many tried to found cities over the ages, however the vast majority didn't grow past the size of a small settlement before they were destroyed. These vast distances between them are also what made the cities so unique from one another. Their culture's were formed largely in isolation, and only began to regularly cross over with each other when [[The Iron Tracks]] were built.\n\nHowever, the wilderness is not impassable. There have been many in [[Zol]]'s history with enough agency to move about them without extreme danger. Some even live their whole lives within the wilderness. This is made possible only through some form of protection. Be it their own power, or the power of another which guides them. \n\nAs an example, some wizards build towers in [[The Witchlands]] to get away from society. Their magical power acting as their defense against threats. Then there are places like The Ashcamps within [[The Kulpis Desert]]. Their protection comes in the form of warriors who hold back the threats which stalk the dunes.

The evil nature of [[Chromatic Dragons]] mixed with the desperate situation of [[Zol]]'s people made for a long drawn out war. The [[Dragons]] were few in number, but extremely powerful. They began by 'toying' with the population as if it were some sick game to them.\n\nThe [[Humans]] quickly devised a way to train dragon slayers armed with uniquely long spears, grappling hooks, and heavy bows. Their tactics spread quickly across [[Zol]], turning the conflict into an evenly matched bout.\n\nAfter a time, arcanists began to discover the nature of their foe. Acting almost like a hive of bees. The [[Chromatic Dragons]], as children of [[Zelatt]] they only sought to create chaos for their mother to feed upon.

They will learn its shape, and illustrate it as a forest of beautiful trees. When asked for details about these trees, the secrets and complexities held within, the map makers cannot provide true answers.

The following is an example of this phenomena:\n\nA commoner, who lives a simple, comfortable life heads into their usual tavern to find an unknown traveler sitting in their preferred seat. Emboldened by anger after a long days work, the commoner confronts the drifter. However, their anger is quickly replaced with fear and regret when the traveler turns to face them. Their features are not abnormal, but something about the travelers eyes strike the commoner with fear. There is no magical trickery at play, but somehow, the commoner knows that the wanderer's eyes have seen things beyond comprehension. The stranger says nothing, merely watching the commoner with impassivity. Something about this stranger makes them seem like almost they *exist* more than every person in the room. They emit a feeling of power, and mystery simply by existing. The commoner realizes everyone else in the room has seemingly figured this out already, and flees the tavern.

All of the Elemental Planes are under the [[The Mortal Coil]]'s effect. Each plane is a surreal, majestic thing of its own right. They are home to strange beings composed almost exclusively of matter and energy pertaining to their respective element. Some of these creatures manifest as beings that are something like a fairy, or a spirit called [[Sylfs]]. These\n\nThese 4 Elemental planes are:\n\n## The Plane of Invigorant\nThe Plane of Oceans and Forests. An ever spanning ocean covered in island forests. Most plant animal and fungi here are all completely unique all the way down to the individual level. They live and die in incredibly short spans and seem to spawn from the environment itself.\n\n![[Invigorant.png]]\n\nOrganisms that do not live and die in uniqueness do live here, but they are uncommon species, like the voracious wasp eels. This is plane supplies the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life giving matter.\n\n## The Plane of Immolation\nThe Sun of [[Zol]]. The Plane of Immolation is what gives the heat of flame and the radiant light to [[Zol]].\n\n![[immolation.png]]\n\nRumors of a city of flame within Immolation exist, but due to its harsh environment there is little information.\n\n[[The Sun]] is an ever moving portal that passes through sky leading to Immolation.\n\n## The Plane of Temperament\nRock, sand, metal, soil and gemstone. The foundation of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is said that The Plane of Temperament is accessible by taking long lateral journeys through [[The Underdark]]. Supposedly it is difficult to judge when one enters or exits Temperament as it manifests as a ever spanning series of caverns.\n\n![[Temperment.png]]\n\nPopulations of Dangerous [[Giants]] and great chitinous beasts reside in Temperament, some of which even have their own cities.\n\n\n## The Plane of Tempest\nThe sky itself. The Plane of Tempest is the most vast and peaceful of [[The Elemental Planes]]. It provides the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life-sustaining oxygen.\n\nIt can be accessed via long lateral journeys in the sky. It contains many avian species who travel freely between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and Tempest.\n\n![[Tempest.png]]\n\nTempest contains no landmasses, but does house many large beings known as Buoyants. These beings appear like a mix between a whale and a large balloon, and act as a resting place for flying creatures who need it. Large Buoyants even have forests growing on their backs.   \n\n## Sylfs\n[[Sylfs]] are strange beings, born by unknown means. Their bodies are not corporeal, but they posses very powerful minds. Many think of them as self contained souls, never bound to a body of their own. They can influence the appearance of their physical form, but exist as one of four types:\n- **Mistings** who hail from **Invigorant**, appear as constantly shifting creatures of growing plants and flowing water\n- **Cindrins** who hail from **Immolation**, appear as beings made from cracked and burning stone\n- **Stalegs** who hail from **Temperament**, appear as beings of lightly colored crystal \n- **Typhis** who hail from **Tempest**, appear as beings of flowing wisps of air and small clouds of vapor\n\n[[Sylfs]] are capable of speech, and minor manipulations of the physical world. However the most notable thing about them is their ability to interface with the minds other beings. [[Sylfs]] are known to bond with beings they individually appreciate. This bond allows the being and the sylf to communicate, and grants the being magical power through the will of [[Observance]]. For most this power manifests as a minor affinity for whatever element the sylf is comprised of, but in some cases the bond grows more powerful. A strong bond allows for great feats of magic, and in some cases an individual can manifest their sylf as a physical object.\n\nHowever this bond is not so easily gained, [[Sylfs]] are known to be very stubborn and elusive. There is only one consistent case of [[Sylfs]] bonding mortals: the [[Genasi]].  [[Genasi]] are a small race of people located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Their home is located in a space where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is considerably thinner. This allows for [[Sylfs]] to move back and forth between the [[Planes]] with ease.\n\nGenasi are born with an appearance and physiology similar to humans, but in the first decade of their lives they typically bond a sylf, this alters their appearance, and grants them abilities. However [[Genasi]] are not the only beings who can receive this bond, but bonds outside of this typical relationship are extremely rare.\n\nWhen a bond is obtained, it may appear in a number of different ways. Some sylfs like to be very present. Appearing physically to everyone, and speaking vocally. Others may be more shy, speaking and appearing only to their bonded individual. Some are so elusive they only manifest as a deep, subconscious thing, which has been described as an internal friendly presence or emotion. These bonds are very intimate things and extremely hard to break.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Elven-Dwarven-Concord":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Elven-Dwarven Concord\"\n---## The Elven-Dwarven Concord\n[[Gethsemane]] was a place of high tension between the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]].

Diverse groups of closely knit individuals travelling from city to city via long convoys of caravans. No other nomadic tradition has been able to survive as long as [[The Hatiat]]. This is because their traditions are best suited to survive [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]]. There are many aspects to Hatiatan Tradition which make it distinct, but the aspects which specifically lend themselves to [[The Hatiat]]'s resilience are what have made it so significant.\n\n## Culture of Resilience\nMost nomadic traditions die off or disband within a few generations. [[The Hatiat]] are unique as they have remained despite the challenges of nomadic life. Their culture makes up almost all of nomadic history within [[The Three Corners]]. Many nomadic groups will often start under another name, but eventually convert to Hatiat as it is considered the safest way to live as a nomad. This effect has made [[The Hatiat]] synonymous with the term nomad. That's not to say that there aren't other nomadic cultures, just none so well founded. [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]] make life outside of cities harsh and unhospitable, however [[The Hatiat]] have developed a way to protect themselves, and lead life fulfilling lives.\n\nScholars Credit these 6 common traits amongst Hatiatan Caravans as the primary reasons for the culture's resilience.\n- **Reliance on and Reverence of Cities** - The safest places within [[Zol]] are its cities. The Hatiat recognize this, so all of their journeys are focused on travelling from city to city. [[The Hatiat]] will set up camp outside of the city, living there for weeks or months at a time. They will conduct trade, and work for coin within the civilized regions of the world.\n- **Authority Structure** - Caravans are lead by a single individual known as a **Wheelweather**. The role is gained by being selected by the previous Wheelweather. Wheelweathers are often known as being wise, worldly, intelligent, well respected, and well loved by their caravan. Typically they are at least halfway through their expected lifespan, but usually much older. Aiding the Wheelweather in their task are known simply as **Wheels**. The Wheelweather typically appoints one Wheel for every 9 people in a caravan. They also have the right to remove said role if need be.\n- **Vigils** - Caravans cannot travel if they do not have protection. Vigils are individuals who posses the means to fight off [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]], and protect the caravan. Caravans usually will not travel if they do not have 1 vigil for every 9 members, with a minimum of 3 vigils. One can be both a Vigil and a Wheel/Wheelweather.\n- **Political Neutrality and Favored Reputation** - One of the major tenants of Hatiatan culture is caravan members are not allowed to push back against religious, moral, or political cultures held within a city. [[The Hatiat]] see themselves as guests within each city. This makes many members uncomfortable, but it is what gained The Hatiat their favored reputation across [[The Three Corners]]. They are seen as unproblematic traders who come to their city, brining commerce and good fortune. However not every city sees [[The Hatiat]] in a good light. They are largely disliked in:\n\t- [[Jerda'll]]\n\t- [[Little Triumph]]\n\t- The entirety of [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\t- [[Hoss]]\n\t- [[Mod Dranor]]\n- **Merchant Trade** - [[The Hatiat]] are known for their excellent merchants. The caravans will travel the world, gathering rare goods, information, and treasures. The trade of these goods are what keep a caravan going.\n- **Taith, Toth, and Tarth** - Joining/Leaving a Hatiatan caravan is surprisingly simple. This allows for people to join caravans with little hassle. A larger caravan is a stronger caravan. The events of joining/leaving a caravan are marked with ceremonies. These ceremonies have great significance amongst Hatiatan Tradition. \n\t- Joining with a caravan is known as **Taith**. One can approach a caravan and request to be tried for **Taith**. One of the Caravan's Wheels, or Wheelweather, will ask them a series of questions in front of an audience composed of caravan members. These questions differ with each **Taith**. The questions are often of a moral nature. If the individual passes the trial, and the caravan has the resources to accommodate them, they gain membership.\n\t- **Toth** is the leaving of a caravan. It is a solemn event. It is initiated by a caravan member telling one of their leaders that they intend to disband. It is a rare, and usually occurs when the caravan is stopped at a city. The caravan gathers round the individual who intends to depart, and they share their goodbyes. Then the individual will give the caravan a gift. This gift is not required to be of any specific value, but in Hatiatan Tradition the more sentimental, the better. However, many will also give coin, as running a caravan has a significant cost. If someone does not have anything to give, it is customary for them to gift the caravan the road dust from their boots. A symbol of their journey.\n\t- **Tarth** is the ceremony which marks an exile from the caravan. It is a dark thing within Hatiatan Tradition that is not often spoken of. If a member of the caravan betrays their group, they are branded with the symbol of a broken wheel. A circle with a much smaller circle in its center. The two circles are bridged by 6 lines representing the spoke of a wheel. One spoke for each of the kingdoms. The part of the outer circle between the first and second spoke are missing, representing the break in the wheel. It appears almost like a sliced pie, with a single piece removed. A person marked with this symbol is not allowed to even approach any Hatiatan Caravan in the future. Beyond that, most cultures around [[The Three Corners]] view [[The Hatiat]] with great favor, so those marked with the broken wheel are often not seen in the best light. Some caravans see this as the worst fate, so the will kill their traitors rather than conducting this ceremony.\n\n## Other Aspects of Hatiatan Culture\nBeyond their resilient culture, [[The Hatiat]] have many other traditions. They are known for their family-like bonds between caravan members, their songs, their art, their freedom of expression and religion (when not in a city that merits hiding those behaviors), and their food. Those who are part of [[The Hatiat]] typically join because want to see the world, have no where else to go, or were born into the lifestyle. This stimulates a diverse, and passionate culture. Each Caravan is distinct in their specific cultures, and demeanor in the same way that every family is distinct. Caravans will often identify themselves with a name and symbol.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Hooded-Presence":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Hooded Presence\"\n---*Wayward God of Shadows, Minor Deity*\n![[The hooded presence.png]]\n\nThe [[Fell]] god of deception, espionage, and trickery.

The purpose of the attack seemed to be a sort of raid. With their goal being to be to *harvest* the cosmic power held within [[The Trinity]].\n\nTheir strategy largely relied on the strength and surprise of their initial attack, continued by growing their forces with their parasitic nature. This strategy may have worked for them in the long run, if not for the fact that they chose to attack [[Kapesh]] initially.\n\nTheir goal involved stealing large conduits of [[Viridescence]], the primal power of [[Zol]]. It apparently has immense value amongst [[The Cosmos]].\n\nThe [[Illithids]] took [[Stigmata]] as their base of operations, and converted many [[Humans]] to [[Illithids]]. These new [[Illithids]] were originally subservient to the invaders, but their human stubbornness resurfaced in their personality over time.\n\nBecause of this, the [[Illithids]] faced a great deal of in-fighting and discordance amongst their ranks. The converted humans tried to seize power for themselves. This ultimately left the invaders open to attacks.\n\n[[Wordbearers]] and a large scale force managed to nearly wipe them all out in a single week once the effort was coordinated. Many [[Illithids]] fled to [[The Cosmos]] or hid in dark corners of [[Zol]]. Those that did not flee were captured and interrogated.\n\n## Aftermath\nThe captured Illithids were interrogated for information about the attack. It turned out that they were a small, unremarkable force from wastelands of a place they called [[The Space Outside Reality]].\n\nMuch of what is known about [[The Cosmos]], [[The Space Outside Reality]], [[Illithids]], [[Goh'zul]], and the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]] comes from these interrogations.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Immortal-Ocean":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Immortal Ocean\"\n---*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nThe Skyless Sea.

His burning red hair flows endlessly and is often depicted hammering at an anvil.\n\n## Moral\n[[The Iron Father]] teaches the moral of dedication. His scripture speaks of cause and effect. When one dedicates themselves wholly to a cause, their effect follows suit. Life will pose trials and tribulations and will push one away from their cause, but it is in these moments true strength can be forged.\n\n## Associations\n[[The Iron Father]] is associated with:\n- [[Dwarves]]\n\t- Note that the [[Dwarves]] of [[Mod Dranor]] worship the [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[Bethar]]. This cultural influence over millennia has stretched far beyond the dwarven city. This makes Dwarven followers of [[The Iron Father]] a minority. This  difference of religion sparks social issues amongst dwarves. \n- Smithing\n- Fire\n- Song\n\t- Specifically dwarven chant\n\n## Realm\nWithin [[The Unknown Realm]], [[The Iron Father]]'s domain is said to be one of stone and flame.

These individuals seek to fulfil not just a simple goal, but a needed role in the world.

Designed by the combined efforts of [[The University]], [[Kerketh Academy]] and [[The Kybis Assembly]]. A complex combination of [[Iron Light]] and infrastructure that spans [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. A network of [[Trains]] that allows for anyone, powerful or not, to cross [[Zol]].\n\nOriginally conceptualized for the purpose of unifying the people of [[Zol]]. Allowing for common folk to cross the too-dangerous wilds with ease. This vision was met with resistance from the more conservative members of society. However, even they could not deny the immense economical benefits it would create.\n\nThe design and production of engines was given to the city of [[Rails]] due to its central location. The cities name becoming the nickname for the tracks the [[Trains]] ran on. Their blueprints coming from [[Artificers]] from [[Kerketh Academy]].\n\nDroves of workers and garrisons had to perform long and drawn out missions to construct railways between cities. Monsters and beasts of the wilds would attack the workers daily. The only reason so many did the labor was the high wages for rail workers and security detail.\n\n## Modern Function\nIn the current day and age, the [[Trains]] are integral to society. Moving exports and passengers of all types. The trains themselves are quite wide, with a typical car having the dimensions of 20ft by 80ft. They move at a high velocity any creature or structure in their path is typically obliterated.\n\nRunning on the power of [[Nodes]] in a state of [[Space]], drawing them in at the nose of the train and converting them into motion. The operation of the complex [[Apparatum]] is performed by a conductor. The [[Iron Light]] configurations used in most trains causes a reaction which makes the engine become extremely cold. If an engine gets too cold it can damage, and possibly ruin it. To combat this, trains use simple coal fire engines to keep the engines hot.\n\nThere is a monetary cost for using the [[Trains]], either as a passenger or using them for transporting goods. In either case, there is a spectrum of services all at different costs. This allows for even the less fortunate to use [[The Iron Tracks]] if they are able to save for it.\n\nThe [[Trains]] move hundreds of cars long night and day. In almost all cases the tracks run outside of a cities walls, stopping at a local station. Their incoming is felt as rumbling earth, and a distinct humming sound.\n\n## Notable Exceptions\nSome cities, or kingdoms do not use [[The Iron Tracks]]. Be it religious beliefs, geographical location, or cultural differences.\n- [[The Ward]] does not use [[The Iron Tracks]] because of their disallowance of [[Apparatum]] for religious reasons.\n- [[The Glassius Reach]] is not included in [[The Iron Tracks]] due to political differences and recent war.\n- [[Gethsemane]] only has a single train station in [[Mod Dranor]]. This is largely because of Xenophobia.\n- [[Heliodor]] has a station nearby located on the ground where individuals can take [[Airships]] to the city.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Isles-of-AlKehtal":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Isles of Al'Kehtal\"\n---*The Island City of Pirates*\n![[Isles of Al Kehtal.png]]\n\nBuilt from the remains of ships torn asunder by waves or combat, [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] is a haven for the pirates of [[The Three Corners]]. It is a city where all ships and crews must set aside rivalries, lay down their arms to do trade, resupply, and have a drink. There is no King, or Queen of [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]]. However there is a ruling body known as The Furled Sail Council, made up of the most influential captains amongst the community, lead by the Lord Captain. This group operates under a very flexible, but important ruleset. No one has a record of when it started, or who wrote the original rules but [[The Code]] binds all pirates.\n\nThe city is broken up into three main islands:\n\n## Port Keep\n![[port_keep.png]]\n\nThe North East Island. Port Keep is the central hub for the island, and the meeting place for The Furled Sail Council. It is the smallest island of the city, and few have any real reason to go here.\n\n## Flotsam\n![[flotsam.png]]\n\nThe South East Island. The largest of the islands.

Jetsam is the place all pirates think of when looking for a place to plan, plot, repair, rest, fight, fuck, dine, and drink. It is an ugly, dirty, and crowded place. It is impossible for a pirate not to love. Many of its districts are heavily associated with some groups of pirates, and it is important to know where you are going.

There is no policing force, all laws are upheld by the people of the city. Any enforcement is done by hired muscle, or loyal crew members.

One can only be brought into the council by invitation from more than half of the council, or by inheriting the spot from a superior that noted you as their successor. Overseeing this group is the Lord Captain. A title given by popular vote amongst council members. This rank gives an individual 2 votes, and ties go in favor of the Lord Captain. This seems like a small thing, but votes frequently reach an even split. This makes having the Lord Captains favor an extremely important thing. The trickle down effect from this paves the way for the whole power struggle amongst pirates. |\n| Gilded              | Rank         | Those recognized as important enough by the council to receive a gilded crest. These crests come with a whole cast of benefits such as better deals for repairs on ships, supplies, and taxes on trades. They also mark you and an influential person amongst pirates. This status means actions you take may have more sever consequences by [[The Code]]. Rivalries you make, battles you partake in, and treasure you hunt will likely have an effect on the greater community of pirates. If you do things that could damage the way of life for pirates, there are severe consequences.                                                                           |\n| Goons               | Rank         | The average pirate.

As well as his Furled Sail Council. This group makes decisions on how best business should be conducted in relation to external threats like the military of kingdoms, or sea monsters. They are also responsible for making decisions on punishments relating to pirates breaking [[The Code]]. These things are all done by vote, the Lord Captain gets 2 votes, and ties go in favor of the Lord Captain.\n\n## Laws\nThe city subscribes to [[The Code]]. A set of flexible, but very important laws to the pirates of the city.\n\n| Rule                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| The Rule of Stashed Swords | Within [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]], no one is allowed to bring their weapons around with them in a way where they can be readily available for combat. Fighting is allowed, but if you aim to kill you will be seen as a traitor. This goes for [[Caster]]s as well, you can use magic in a fight, but if you seek to do permanent damage or kill [[The Code]] will not see you favorably. |\n| The Rule of Locked Chests  | Within [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]], no one can steal from each other. Things can be bought, traded, or wagered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| The Rule of Kept Council   | The pirates of [[The Three Corners]] will respect the rule of The Furled Sail Council. The Council will appoint a Lord Captain who will hold greater voting power. Council members must be invited by more than half of current council members, or inherit the role from their superior.                                                                                                     |\n| The Rule of Fair Trade     | To dock at [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]], one must conduct trade.

This crest symbolizes their influence, and gives them more favorable taxes, but more stringent rules when it comes to [[The Code]]. One cannot deny a crest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] are a vital organ in the criminal world all across [[The Three Corners]].

[[The Lifeweaver]] embodies the natural beauty and destruction of [[Zol]]\n\n## Depiction\nWhen appearing, [[The Lifeweaver]] grows and amalgamates from the natural elements in the space they manifest. Appearing usually as a woman formed of plant and stone, or a strange shape similar to that of the upper half of a humanoid body.\n\nThis appearance can happen at any scale. One legend in particular tells of her coopting a mountain and cloud formation into a body.\n\n## Symbolism\nFour overlapping strands of fiber arranged in a diamond.\n\n## Behavior\nKnown to be loving to all life, but holds the natural order of things in the highest regard. [[The Lifeweaver]] would rather let prey fall to predator, or forest burn in fire than intervene. So long as it is natural in its cause. To disrupt this is sinful in their eyes.\n\n## Realm\nResiding in [[The Pure Forest]] a beautiful realm that's entrance only exists in the quiet, beautiful and untouched corners of [[Zol]]. Almost impossible for mortals to find. This realm is entirely unspoiled from outside influence.\n\n## Worshipers\nTheir followers manifest in many ways. In a formal setting, garden cathedrals are constructed in their honor. In a less formal setting, worship may be performed in odd naturalistic ways by rural peoples and things of the like.\n\nSome followers worship a single facet of nature in [[The Lifeweaver]]'s name. For example, some may worship stone and mountains, while others focus on the winds and sky.\n\n![[The Lifeweaver humanoid.png]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Maul-Bearer":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Maul Bearer\"\n---One of [[The Void]]'s powerful [[Demons]].

Sorrow, Majesty, and Luna.\n\n![[The moons night sky.png]]\n\nThe moons of [[Zol]] are thought to have once been planets that were consumed by [[Goh'zul]] before his defeat. Their previously life-covered surfaces were left to ruin within the stomach of the Great Old One.\n\nNow, the three planets grace [[Zol]] with beautiful illumination during its nights. Their barren landscape has begun to stir with life again as strange beings have made homes there, and ancient things from eons past awaken to the disturbances.\n\n## Sorrow\nThe smallest of the 3 moons. Sorrow is known for its yellow hue and planetary ring. The ruins of Sorrow are the most intact of the 3 moons, and house many treasures and secrets about [[The Cosmos]].\n\nFew bear the power to travel to any of the moons. However those that reach sorrow have met monsters that inhabit its surface making it very dangerous to traverse, but the few who have the capacity and drive to go there quest for its treasure.\n\n## Majesty\nThe second largest of the trio, and the brightest of the trio. The Desert Moon. Majesty's surface is covered with vast dunes of white sand. While originally thought to be barren, it was discovered that deep below its surface lies caves full of valuable mineral resources.\n\nGreat expeditions have been made by powerful arcanists in the past to harness these resources. Unfortunately, these were rarely met with success as the planet is inhabited by colossal omnivorous worms.\n\nMajesty also has a large shadow that passes over its surface in a regular pattern. This makes the moon appear in different phases like: full, half, crescent and new. No one knows the exact nature of this ever flowing shadow, but it is central to many myths and legends. \n\n## Luna\nThe largest of the three moons, The Shifting Fate. Luna has strange properties that baffle scholars to this day. Its stony, crater-covered surface warps and changes with each passing day.\n\nDuring the late [[First Age]], academics noticed that they could predict the likelihood of incoming gales from [[The Storm Horizon]] based on the positions of craters on Luna's surface.\n\nAfter monitoring it for many years, academics noticed patterns when comparing it to historical data. The noticed relationships with things like the economy, plagues, crop harvest, and even the rise and fall of fashion trends amongst nobility.\n\nAcademics have yet to devise a consistent way to predict the meanings of Luna's surface beyond the storms, and may never do so. Some [[Witches]] claim to be able to read her surface, but do not divulge their techniques, nor provide proof.\n\n## The Forgotten Heavens\nAmongst these three planets, a single divine realm is shared. [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a place once abandoned like the moons were, now homes one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[The Night Empress]] resides in the strange and celestial plane where she watches all who move under the light of [[The Moons]].\n\n## Orbital patterns\nSorrow and Majesty orbit Luna. Luna herself remains stationary in [[Zol]]'s sky during night and day. [[The Moons]] are faint in comparison to [[The Sun]] during the day, but vibrant and bright during the night.\n\nOccasionally, [[The Sun]] will pass behind the moons, causing an eclipse.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Mortal-Coil":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Mortal Coil\"\n---The force that bonds a soul to a vessel, and disjoins them upon death.\n\n![[the mortal coil.png]]\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is a primal force that exists in [[Zol]], it is what causes things to live and die. Some think it is an effect of the way [[The First Tongue]] bound the [[Sea of Monsters]], making it part of [[The Trinity]]. Others think it is a force of its own.\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is maintained by [[The Coilwalker]]. Some think that he is its reason for its existence, others think him to be an avatar of its greater will. Regardless of what controls [[The Mortal Coil]], its power effects every being in [[Zol]], living or dead.\n\n## The Rules of The Mortal Coil\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is bound to a specific set of rules that determine the function of life and death across all [[Planes]] of [[Zol]].\n- Beforelife\n\t- little is known of the Beforelife, but it is thought that souls grow freely from [[Nodes]] in [[The Ethos]]. These souls are selected at random by [[The Mortal Coil]] to be bound to vessels. This binding begins Life.\n\t- Souls in this state are thought to be non-sentient, and only become true beings when they are bound to a vessel at the moment of birth.\n\t\t- This is not the case for souls that are sent for rebirth after death. In this scenario, the souls-to-be-reborn are considered comatose beings in a state of pseudo-life. \n- Life\n\t- Life begins when a vessel is fully created and a soul is bound to it. This can manifest in a number of ways\n\t\t- Successfully completed reproduction\n\t\t\t- A soul is only attached when a reproductive creature fully forms a child that successfully hatches, or is birthed\n\t\t- Homunculum\n\t\t\t- The creation of an artificial vessel fit enough for a soul to enter it\n\t\t\t- This can manifest in many ways\n\t\t\t\t- A clone of a being is made via magic\n\t\t\t\t- elemental forces are bent to house a soul\n\t\t\t\t- [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]\n\t\t\t\t\t- A newly discovered method of creating life where a complex enough creation of [[Iron Light]] is made and it becomes sentient.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is how beings like [[Warforged]] come to life\n\t\t- Divine Creation\n\t\t\t- When one of the [[Gods]] directly uses their power to create a vessel and injects a soul into it\n\t\t- Natural Spawn\n\t\t\t- When the natural world of [[Zol]] produces a being on its own\n\t- Life cannot begin on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, except for the case of Divine Creation where a powerful enough god manually seeks out a soul for the vessel.\n- Death\n\t- Death occurs when enough damage afflicts the system that maintains life. This can appear as\n\t\t- Damage to the vessel so great it cannot sustain a soul\n\t\t- Damage to the bond between a vessel and soul so great it causes them to separate\n\t\t- Damage to the soul so great it destroys the soul\n\t\t\t- This is the rarest death, as the soul is nigh indestructible. If this occurs there is no way to bring the being back to life.\n\t- If Death does occur, there are cases where magic can be used to restore life, given that the circumstances are correct.\n\t\t- If one does successfully restore life, the being will return with a scar from [[The Mortal Coil]] called a Mortality Rune. A single instance of this creates one, but multiple restorations chain these markings in a line. ![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\t- Death cannot occur on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, save for the case of a soul being destroyed. A death off the mortal coils usually results in banishment to [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]], the [[Prime Material Plane]], or the plane from which they originated. They arrive on the brink of death. This is not always the case as some planes like [[Absurdia]] have their own rules about death off of [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- Something that is defined as ***Immortal*** is not killed by old age, and can withstand colossal amounts of trauma to their vessel, soul, and the bond between them without succumbing to death.\n\t\t- Any living thing can die so long as it is under the full effect of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t\t- This principal is why the [[Gods]] spend most of their time outside of [[The Mortal Coil]], as it gives them much security from other powerful beings who would see them dead.\n\t\t- There is also a theory that the mortal coil weakens extremely powerful beings like [[Gods]]. Some think this is why the [[Zolaen Gods]] do not grace [[The Prime]].\n- Afterlife\n\t- When death occurs, the soul (if intact) leaves the vessel. It is then guided by [[The Coilwalker]] to a new phase of existence based on the way the soul acted in its lifetime.\n\t- The paths a soul can take are:\n\t\t- Rest\n\t\t\t- If one of the [[Gods]] takes a liking to a given soul, the may be brought to stay with them outside [[The Mortal Coil]]. A peaceful eternity amongst kindred spirits.\n\t\t\t- If no god claims it, and the soul is unfit for rebirth or punishment. It is sent to [[Apolyatum]].\n\t\t- Rebirth\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth are sent back into [[The Ethos]] for their soul to be randomly selected for life again. If this occurs they are reborn with small slivers of their past lives interwoven into their being.\n\t\t\t- Slivers of past lives stay with souls, but are largely born without an sense of past life.\n\t\t\t\t- Powerful [[Magic]] investigation can expose truths about past lives.\n\t\t\t- Many things can spark rebirth. Magical influence, the will of a god, or even if the soul itself truly seeks it.\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth many times often go on to do great things.\n\t\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t\t- If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul, they are sent to limbo to undergo some trial.\n\t\t\t\t- Each trial varies for each soul\n\t\t\t\t- Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution\n\t\t\t\t- The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death\n\t\t- Punishment\n\t\t\t- If a soul has led a dark life, [[The Coilwalker]] brings it to [[Damnation]] upon death.\n\t\t\t- It is thought that [[The Coilwalker]] struck an accord with [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. This deal allows for [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] to claim some form of power from the deaths of [[Zol]]. In exchange he is to carry out the punishment for souls marked by [[The Coilwalker]].\n\t\t\t- Punishment varies in severity. Sometimes it is a lesser and/or temporary punishment. After which the damned are allowed to reside in [[Apolyatum]], the highest layer of [[Damnation]], the city of the dead.\n\t\t\t\t- Other times it is a more severe, and eternal punishment\n\t\t- [[Obliteration]]\n\t\t\t- If a soul is deemed too dangerous for [[Zol]], [[The Coilwalker]] will send a soul to the lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. A small, dark, and horrible place called [[Obliteration]]. Here, giant beings made from obsidian destroy the souls sent to them with mighty hammers forged by Aldem himself.\n\t\t- Misc\n\t\t\t- Sometimes strange things can happen to souls. \n\t\t\t\t- Some arcanists have claimed to have trapped souls using magic.\n\t\t\t\t- Others believe that some souls go on to become other things like [[Sylfs]].\n\n## Anti-Life\nOccasionally a powerful vessel or soul will exist without its bonded counterpart, and will somehow continue to function in a strange manner akin to Life. There are likely many things that can cause this, but few are known:\n- [[Magical Backfire]]\n- The will of one of the [[Gods]]\n- [[Necromancy]]\n\nThe result is a physical being who acts in one of two ways\n- Echoes\n\t- This occurs when a being survives having its soul severed, and no further will is imposed on it beyond the initial severing\n\t- The resulting being will attempt to continue their \"life\", but they do so without all of their emotions or memories in tact, resulting in strange behavior. Sometimes the physical body of this creature will also become monstrous in appearance.\n\t- Anti-life is reversible for Echoes if a soul can be rebound to its vessel, returning the being to normal Life again.\n- Undead\n\t- Vessels who have fully died, then given an artificial soul, or have their soul reattached via [[Necromancy]].\n\t\t- When a vessel is not under the influence of a soul, it opens the body up to being magically enhanced in ways that would be otherwise impossible.\n\t- This usually creates a being subservient to the will of its souls creator.\n\t- The strength of the resulting being is dependent on the state of the vessel, and the skill of the souls creator.\n\t- These beings are typically more susceptible to further deaths as the bond between vessel and soul is not perfect.\n\t\t- But the severed artificial soul can be easily reattached and sometimes will do so on its own.\n\nBeings who experience Anti-Life are immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]] as they do not age and have greatly increased fortitude in many cases. A [[Lich]] is a being who does this to themselves intentionally, usually to gain immortality to further pursue the dark side of [[Arcana]].\n\n\n## The Mortal Realms\n[[Zol]] has many [[Planes]] of existence that are all anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[The Mortal Coil]]'s influence does not exist in all [[Planes]]. This has an interesting effect on the behavior of life, death, and gods on any plane.\n\nThe [[Planes]] that contain [[The Mortal Coil]] are known as The Mortal Realms:\n- The [[Prime Material Plane]]\n- The [[Fey]]\n- The [[Fell]]\n- [[The Ethos]]\n- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\nDue to this fact, most [[Gods]] rarely enter these [[Planes]] themselves. When they do, they put their life at great risk.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.342015189Z","tags":null},"/The-Night-Empress":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Night Empress\"\n---*Zolaen God of Night and The Moons, Major Deity*\n![[nightempress.png]]\n\nKnown for their mystery and matronly nature, [[The Night Empress]] is the cryptic mother who sits amongst the [[Zolaen Gods]].

It is a place of both worship and study. It is a school of the [[Observum]], an extension of [[The University]]. It is a massive sprawling temple of black obsidian and sandstone bricks. Within its grounds, many academics, priests, clerics, sages, monks engage in study, debate and worship. All with the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the [[Gods]].\n\nMany think the purist a foolish, impossible, or sinful. However, one cannot deny that in the divide that exists between god and mortal lies the greatest of mysteries. Those who study at [[The Obsidian Temple]] are mostly not users of [[Magic]]. This is because the bond to a greater power required for [[Observance]] is not so easily gained. Most are historians, philosophers, and theologians. These individuals are called miesters. Those who can conduct magic by use of [[Observance]] are called practitioners.\n\nThe greatest divides that exist within the school are ones of belief. Many argue about the righteousness of their gods and the missing pieces of [[Zol]]'s history. Education within the school is voluntary. This means one can choose what sermons, classes and lectures they go to. The whole school is funded by The Crown. Food and lodging are supplied by the institution.\n\n[[The Obsidian Temple]] is also located underneath [[Mount Zerstel]], the volcano which is home to the god [[Daetro]].

There are many records of him answering questions with sentences like \"This is a query for mortals to answer on their own\".\n\n## Admission\nTo join [[The Obsidian Temple]], one must be invited. However requests for entry are often granted if one can make a good enough case for themselves.\n\n## Leadership\nLed by The Elders.

This is a controversial group. |\n| Void Advocates | A very small group within the school who is tasked with researching and questioning the nature of [[Void Gods]]. It is very clearly put that worship of them is not allowed. They are few in number, and carefully selected by the schools leadership.

The myriad of people and chaos made for a wild expanse with little to no governing forces. The region was dubbed The Badlands, and few civilized people ventured there.\n\nEventually some groups gained enough power to establish themselves as coherent powers. As more and more of these groups formed, The Badlands became a feudal battleground. Small cities rose and fell constantly, dotting the area with ruins. Some groups rose high enough to gain legitimacy. It was at this point it became politically advantageous for the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] to support certain parties. They lent aid to the kingdoms of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] who would go on to conquer and found [[Eucaren]].\n\n[[Eucaren]] was originally on track to be part of [[Gethsemane]], but the [[Elves]] held back, as feared something that lied in [[The East Mounts]]. This development caused the rest of The Badlands to organize in response. The diverse kingdoms of [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]] were founded soon after. These regions fought one another for quite some time. It was clear that [[Eucaren]] was much better off with the aid of [[Gethsemane]]. [[Saen]] had little in terms of resources due to their desert environment, so the made an alliance with [[Arcadia]]. This alliance gave the two regions enough capacity to take [[Eucaren]] from [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThere was a long time of disagreement, but a halfling politician and scholar named Perrial Galanor spent much time writing and speaking to the populations of the three kingdoms. She unified them under their shared history of The Badlands, and sought for separation from the [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] due to the their dangerous wars with [[Kapesh]]. The kingdom was named [[Laenwalde]], the gnomish word for perseverance.\n\nPerrial Galanor worked closely with the leaders of [[Eucaren]], [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]]. They were (respectively) Elrose Virrand a halfling woman, Tyran Urla a half elven man, and Fievar Cardanax a human man. These rulers wrote laws, trade agreements, and policies that would unify the three kingdoms.\n\nAmongst this unification effort, an institution was formed in the city of [[Ryze]]. [[The University]] was made to be an organization that would explore, document, and teach [[The Wills]] of [[Zol]]. These efforts would help bind the people of The Badlands with knowledge and the tools of [[Magic]]. Their mission was directly in line with the efforts of Perrial Galanor, the groups worked together because of this.\n\nWhile in the process of determining how the three would share rulership over [[Laenwalde]], a very high ranking nobleman of human descent entered the political scene. His name was Resh Tatelak. He was a kind hearted and charismatic man who had served in the military during the unification efforts under his brother who was the leader of the Arcadian Military. His reputation, bloodline and disposition made him the ideal king. \n\nThe three leaders along with their advisors eventually decided on an agreement where Resh would be installed as king, and they would bend the knee only to him and remain as the installed rulers of their respective regions.\n\nLaenwalde was founded in the year of 3201 and had three years of glory. The vast majority of its people respected the new rule and the cities profited greatly due to new trade routes and lowered military costs. Many loved King Tatelak and he was seen as the ideal all across [[Zol]]. His advisory council served loyally, now staffed with the best rulers of the regions and the most educated members of [[The University]].\n\nSadly this did not last long. Elrose Virrand was killed by a jealous lover, Tyran Urla fell ill with a mysterious sickness that made him unable to conduct much of his work and reduced his lifespan, and The King himself was accidentally killed breaking up a fight between drunk city guards. This threw [[Laenwalde]] into confusion. The people of the three kingdoms quickly grew anxious and unrest was seen in all classes of people.\n\nThe region was stuck in a halfcocked state, and quickly shifted into chaos. King Resh Tatelak had no succession plan. The unity so many had worked for was on the verge of being lost for good, then Resh Tatelak's brother, Radavar Tatelak, next in line to the throne and leader of the King's army took the region by force despite his relatively legitimate claim.\n\nRadavar was by no means a politician, but was an excellent military leader. Once the kingdoms had their chaos quelled, Radavar took the crown as king of [[Laenwalde]]. He implemented his own version of what was to be his brothers rule, but in a manner that some would argue benefitted him a little too well. He greatly dampened the influence of his brothers advisors and had many done away with. This made for the largest kingdom in all of [[Zol]], under a rule of one specific man.\n\nRadavar's hostile takeover lasted for a few generations (103 years to be exact). His descendants were not nearly as gifted has him in military strategy. Civil war began and the Tatelak Bloodline lost the crown.\n\nMany many generations of political and military infighting occurred in Laenwalde. The kingdom was barely held together at the seams. There were times where alliances of cities broke off, only to later return. The only reason it remained mostly unified to this day as Laenwalde was the same reason it was originally founded: the advisory councils.\n\nThere were 8 major changes that occurred in [[Laenwalde]]'s rule from 3201 to 3812:\n- The Death of Resh Tatelak and succession of Radavar Tatelak, *ann. 3203*\n- The Overthrowing of the Tatelak Rule and the installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3306*\n- The Overthrowing of the Falava Rule and the installation of of the Gnoe Rule, *ann. 3353*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gnoe Rule and the installation of of the Veetro Rule, *ann. 3412*\n- The Penthe-Ryze-Kosskazoka secession and the ensuing Citywar that caused the fall of the Veetro Rule and instilled a complex multi-ruler temporary council, *ann. 3489*\n- The return of Penthe, Ryze and Kosskazoka as well as the installation of the Dax'cro Rule, *ann. 3502*\n- The Ejection of the Dax'cro Rule and the installation of of the Gold Council. A complex organization that served as a group of leaders that would rule as a collective. This group frequently had members change due to a high degree of political drama, espionage and assassination, *ann. 3503*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gold Council and the re-installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3758*\n\nLaenwalde's courts and battlefields were an off-and-on, high-stakes game that came to an abrupt and grim end when [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked [[Audran]] in the year 3812.\n\nWhen the attack occurred, the Falava Bloodline was killed in its entirety. While gruesome, the attack pushed Laenwalde to unify against a greater threat. When the kingdom was left to recover from its wounds an The Golden Council was reformed and took the burden of rulership. This was only until a descendant of Resh Tatelak himself was discovered in the city of [[Woogis]]. His name was Byrell Tatelak. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed in the year 4259 and the floating bastion of [[Heliodor]] was constructed in the year of 4262.\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/The-Three-Corners":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Three Corners\"\n---See [[The Three Corners of Civilization]].","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/The-Three-Corners-of-Civilization":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Three Corners of Civilization\"\n---![[Zol World Map v1.png]]\n\nA land bound by dangerous and impassible wilds, [[The Three Corners of Civilization]] sits on the edge of [[The Grand Nothing]].

Many fear [[The Underdark]], and for good reason. There exists an old dwarven saying, that essentially says: *\"Fear what lurks below [[Zol]], for not even The [[Gods]] know what resides down there\"*.\n\nThe most widely known entities that exist in [[The Underdark]] are:\n- [[Jerda'll]]\n- [[Mod Dranor]]\n- The Belowcean of [[The Grand Nothing]]\n\n## History and Inhabitants\nTraversal through most of [[The Underdark]] is dangerous, cramped, confusing, and of course *dark*.

While appearing fearsome they are actually quite friendly so the stories say.\n- A city of Fire [[Giants]] built within a volcanic pool.\n- The ruins of some ancient city below [[The Ward]].\n- Massive sleeping beasts the size of whole city districts.\n- Entrances to [[Damnation]]\n- Stories of entering Temperament of [[The Elemental Planes]] ","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/The-University":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The University\"\n---Those who seek to understand [[The Wills]], the people of [[The Three Corners]], and how the world can be bettered. [[The University]] was founded upon altruistic motives during the later stages of [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. It is comprised of three branches:\n- The [[Arcanum]], which studies the will of [[Arcana]]\n\t- [[The Brass Hall]]\n\t- [[Jhenbridge]]\n- The [[Observum]], which studies the will of [[Observance]]\n\t- [[The Obsidian Temple]]\n\t- [[The First Bastion]]\n- The [[Viridium]], which studies the will of [[Viridescence]]\n\t- [[The Conservatory]]\n\n## Values\n*\"The pursuit of understanding, and the betterment of [[Zol]]\"*\n\n[[The University]] as a whole was a product of a need for understanding the nature of [[The Wills]]. At its heart, the organization seeks to educate and draw conclusions about the mysteries of [[Zol]]. This manifests as teaching, exploration, historical investigation, archeology, experimentation, and things of the like. [[The University]] is not known for tampering with great dark forces like some other institutions. However it is not entirely without its own wrong doings.\n\n[[The University]] is arguably the largest singular institution in all [[The Three Corners]]. Both in its members, and geographic distribution. This means its resources, and authority are equally distributed. This is not to say it is spread thin, however it is difficult to manage such a large entity. Occasionally, things that are macabre, extortionate, dangerous, or just plainly unwise are conducted under the banner of [[The University]].\n\n## Origin\nIn the [[First Age]], during [[The Taming of the Badlands]], a group of powerful academics in [[Ryze]] began conceptualizing an organization that would seek to make sense of [[The Trinity]]. It would be similar to the academic institutions of the east, but different in the fact that it would not neglect the more spiritual aspects of [[The Wills]].\n\nDuring the unification efforts of [[The Badlands]], these academics were instrumental in bringing order to the land. Originally the school began in [[The Brass Hall]], a large section of [[Brass Taldora]]. Each of the three wings within the hall was dedicated to one of [[The Wills]]. Forming The [[Arcanum]], [[Observum]], and [[Viridium]]. It wasn't long before [[The University]] outgrew the hall, and began acquiring, and constructing buildings elsewhere. At first this was just within [[Ryze]], but it soon expanded to other cities as [[The University]] began absorbing smaller organizations like [[Jhenbridge]], [[The Obsidian Temple]] and [[The First Bastion]].\n\n## Structure\n[[The University]] follows a simple method of organization, as it is complexly comprised of many different subgroups all across [[Laenwalde]].\n- ### Leadership\n\t- At the top of the hierarchy sits one master for each of [[The Wills]]. They must be in the uppermost circles of the organization, and are almost always the leader of one of [[The University]]'s schools. It is worth noting that those in this position have historically served on [[The Golden Council]] of [[Heliodor]].\n\t\t- [[Arcanum]] - Grandmaster Whiles Gennador, an aged human man, and head of [[The Brass Hall]]. Brother to High Priest Tarsin Gennador\n\t\t- [[Observum]] - High Priest Tarsin Gennador, the head of the Zolaen Church within [[Laenwalde]]. An aged human man. Brother to Grandmaster Whiles Gennador\n\t\t- [[Viridium]] - High Se'kir Fjor Mizella, a tabaxi woman of great wisdom. Head of [[The Conservatory]].\n\t- Within each of the schools, the organizational structure differs.\n- ### Size\n\t- [[The University]] is massive. It is over eight thousand members strong across all its subsidiaries.\n- ### Rules\n\t- There are many rules all throughout [[The University]], however they all circle back to one ideal: Knowledge should not be used to do harm.\n- ### Admission\n\t- Admission to [[The University]] varies based on the school which one enters.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for mind\n\n## Assets\n- [[Arcanum]]\n\t- [[The Brass Hall]], which acts as the center of [[The University]]\n\t- [[Jhenbridge]]\n- [[Observum]]\n\t- [[The Obsidian Temple]]\n\t- [[The First Bastion]]\n- [[Viridescence]]\n\t- [[The Conservatory]]\n- [[The University]] also has many satellite locations as well, like small studies, outposts, temples, and things of the like. There isn't a city within [[Laenwalde]] that does not posses a building owned by [[The University]].\n\n## Relationships\n- A strong relationship with [[Kerketh Academy]], and [[The Golden Council]]\n- An amicable relationship with the political powers of [[Gethsemane]], save for [[Ep Drukar]] which it does not have much connection with at all.\n- [[The Bladehammer Guild]] in which it has a faction of its own\n- A great dislike for [[The Kybis Assembly]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/The-Unknown-Realm":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Unknown Realm\"\n---*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nA plane brought to [[Zol]] by the [[The Wandering Gods]].

Within it lies threats and abominations unknown even to the [[Gods]].\n\n![[The Void.png]]\n\nWhen viewing [[Zol]] from [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]] is not visible. It is thought to be hidden away by the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\nDespite the [[Gods]] attempts to disjoin The Void from the lives of mortals, The Void is closely related to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It looms in [[Zol]]'s history, and threatens its modern days. Only kept back by the constant efforts of the [[Gods]].\n\nThere are many physical entrances between [[The Void]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. They exist at the lowest depths of [[Zol]]. Entrances in the deepest fathoms of the ocean lead directly to [[The Void]], and entrances in [[The Underdark]] lead into The Void's subplane, [[Damnation]].\n\n## Known Properties of The Void\nLittle is known about [[The Void]]. Many scholars and theologians gather what they can about the strange space in an attempt to protect mortals from it. However some seek its power in a dark pursuit.\n\nThe known properties of The Void are:\n- Entrance to [[The Void]] is similar to most forms of planar travel, but escaping it is extremely difficult. This is due to the will of [[Gods]].\n\t- Expeditions have been made there, but few have returned. It is thought a mortals easiest method of returning is through [[Apolyatum]], the highest level of [[Damnation]].\n- The [[Void Gods]] largely view this place as the true form of [[Zol]] and seek to demolish all other planes and return them to this state.\n\t- No hard evidence exists of any hierarchy between [[Void Gods]]\n- There are likely more [[Void Gods]] than what are known to mortals.\n- [[The Void]] has distinct depths.\n\t- [[Damnation]] is thought to be the most shallow part of [[The Void]]\n\t- The deeper one ventures into [[The Void]] the more dangerous and inescapable it becomes.\n- Death in the void is unique. Academics are not sure if it exists on [[The Mortal Coil]], but interrogated [[Demons]] revealed that if one dies in [[The Void]], their soul becomes homed to it and both their vessel and soul are sent deep within its confines.\n\t- Effectively if one dies in [[The Void]], they are locked within permanently. Even to the greatest of mortal magic.\n\n## Damnation\n[[Damnation]] is a subplane of [[The Void]] and seems to feed off the souls of the [[Prime Material Plane]]'s dead.\n\n## Demons and Fiends\nResiding the the greater Void are many horrible beings called [[Demons]]. They come in great varieties and almost all have destructive intentions.\n\nWithin the subplane of [[Damnation]] resides a similar but distinctly different cast of beings called [[Fiends]]. To an uneducated eye they would seem the same as [[Demons]]. However there is a sole difference that divides them.\n\n[[Fiends]] are beings bound by oath to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they are caught by a greater demon betraying him their souls are sent for destruction. Most [[Fiends]] are endlessly loyal to Aldem because of this.\n\n[[Demons]] however are not bound to serve a master if they do not choose to. This gives [[Demons]] a sense of pride over fiends that has forged a unique hatred between the 2 groups over many ages.\n\nThe two groups of monsters clash regularly. Mortals have even been known to gain favors from one group when sparring with the other.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/The-Wasp-Eater":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Wasp Eater\"\n---*Void God of Plague, Minor Deity*\n![[The Wasp Eater.png]]\n\nHe who culls, King of Plagues, [[The Wasp Eater]] is a hyper intelligent being who claims to seek the fair destruction of life itself.

Forces of [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] were advancing on the city of [[Corinth]]. As they reached the north, in the forest of Galfora, the incoming armies were intercepted by Glassian troops. A bloody battle was fought, and was leaning in favor of the invaders. \n\nThe battle was instantly swayed when an unknown man, Jaw, suddenly entered the fight. He bore no weapons, but killed nearly the entire invading force on his own. Even [[The Word of Blades]], who was there that day could not defeat him. The invaders were forced to retreat. Further invasion attempts were met with the same fate. Jaw's wrath was so powerful, it leveled the forest of Galfora.

From these three things, we are one.*\n![[Trinian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Trinaism]] is a Trinity-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that all things, even the [[Gods]], are only allowed to exist through [[The Trinity]]. It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god.\n\n[[Trinaism]] teaches the idea that all things are one. All things come from [[The Trinity]], and ultimately all things return to [[The Trinity]]. Even alien things from [[The Cosmos]] must adhere to the [[Magic]] and divine aspects of [[The Trinity]]. The latter fact is supported by science.\n\n[[Trinaism]] also teaches the idea that there is a careful, intended balance to all things which [[The Trinity]] has orchestrated. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] granted the people of [[Zol]] free will. Through this gift, it is possible to create imbalance in the world, and only through the teachings of [[The Trinity]] can people maintain its careful balance.\n\n[[Trinaism]] sees the [[Zolaen Gods]] as extensions of [[The Trinity]].\n## Values\n- Structure\n- Connectedness\n- Unity\n- Order\n- Rebirth\n- Balance\n- Excellence\n- [[The Wills]]\n- [[Magic]]\n- Fate/Destiny\n- Free Will\n- Prophecy\n- Divinity of the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[The Old Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Trinity]]\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Trinaism]] believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Trinian scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. In defeating [[The Wretch]], [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]] allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].\n\n### Ancient Society\nTrinian scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].\n\n### The Undoing\nTrinian scripture talks about the ancient people of [[Old Zol]] straying from [[The Trinity]]'s careful balance. It is said that they did this in an attempt to reach divinity themselves. In doing this, they created such an imbalance in the world that [[The Undoing]] occurred. It is thought that this imbalance was created by ancient [[Humans]].\n\nIt is believed in [[Trinaism]] that [[The Trinity]] began weaving threads of Fate to ensure the people of [[Zol]] would never stray into the dark again.\n\n## Church Structure\nThe Trinian Church is known for its adherence to hierarchical structure. These hierarchies form based on communities an their connectedness to greater societal groups. This is most often seen within the scope cities. Cities will usually have a grand cathedral dedicated to Trinian Worship. This cathedral would be lead by an **Obseratum**, the highest form of priesthood within [[Trinaism]]. Beneath that would be **Grand Priests**, **Arch Priests**, **High Priests**, and finally **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist [[Trinaism]] typically focuses on the concept of order, and interconnectedness between things. It idealizes the concept of being exemplary within ones life. It does not teach the ideals of going on to greater things. To put another way, if you are a farmer it is holy to be a *great* farmer. This is because great farmers are needed to maintain the interconnected aspects of society, people, and the world itself.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for its idealization of hierarchy, order, balance, and structure. This manifests largely as the ideal that everything is as it should be. It believes that [[The Trinity]] has placed everything in its place, and one should respect that place. Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for supporting one-sided societal structures like high nobility and [[Slavery]].\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n[[Trinaism]] is extremely wide-spread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]].\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Trinaism]]'s specific teachings about structure, order, and interconnectedness largely depend on the interpretation of the clergy within one's church. Trinian scripture as a whole is comprised of many texts. This has made for many unique interpretations of the religion's details as not all priesthoods value each piece of writing equally. \n- [[Trinaism]] is closely related to the [[Ashian]] church. They have many similarities. However the nuances of [[Ashian]] religion are what make them distinct.\n- Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] supports the ideas of [[Great Magic]] and [[The Triumvirate]].\n- [[Trinaism]] is similar in many ways to Zolaen-Centric belief. However, it holds [[The Trinity]] above the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n- Some manifestations of [[Trinaism]] contend with the idea of [[The Anti-Trinity]], a dark counterpart to their god.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/Triton":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Triton\"\n---See [[Tritons]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/Tritons":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Tritons\"\n---*Those of Lake, River, and Sea*\n![[Triton.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Triton]] come in many shapes and sizes.

Separated by [[The Narrow Sea]], these nations warred from roughly annum 2600 to 4000. Initially sparked by [[Gethsemane]] enslaving humans who crossed into their territories, and [[Kapesh]] doing the same with [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. [[Kapesh]] offered an exchange of prisoners, which [[Gethsemane]] rejected.\n\nThis rejection sparked conflict between the nations that lasted centauries. It wavered in intensity over the years, and its core motivation changed from enslavement, to expansion, to resources, and finally religious differences. \n\nFew major effects surfaced from the battles aside from death, and political divide. However, the city of [[Riverbridge]], originally part of [[Gethsemane]], constantly changed hands due to its location on the border. Slaves were eventually traded between sides for their freedom, any many died in the extended conflict. However, the conflict did give a foothold for the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Peak of the Battles\nThe peak occurred during annum 3673. [[Gethsemane]] had sought the aid of a powerful being from [[The Void]] called [[The Maul Bearer]]. A demon of great strength who was to be given any territory he conquered as payment, so long as [[Gethsemane]] kept him unbound from [[The Void]]. The demon and his army destroyed the [[Kapesh]] city of [[Rello Arr]] and its surrounding territory, creating the West Scars.\n\n[[Kapesh]] was able to kill the [[The Maul Bearer]] and his armies before they took [[Kierketholl]], but the attacks left [[Kapesh]] weak for generations. This weakness later gave way to the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Information on Slaves during the Battles\nEnslavement of [[Humans]], [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] sparked the initial conflict, and later became a bargaining chip between sides. These slaves began to be treated more as high valued prisoners than slaves, as their value in trades during conflict often outweighed their value as workers.\n\nThey suffered much injustice during these times, but the [[Off-Human]] slaves faced a much darker fate. The ways the nations had to stretch during wartimes depended heavily on the labor of slaves. The greater the stakes of the battle, the greater the mistreatment of [[Off-Human]] slaves. Many recognize this suffering as the greatest of all during the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\n## The Triumvirate Concord\nAfter the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] and the creation of [[Warforged]], the [[Triumvirate Battles]] entered a state of fast moving destruction and exhaustion of resources. The machines were so efficient at warfare that they expedited the rate at which the conflict occurred far beyond what normal military strategy could prepare for. This created a sort of mutually-assured-destruction. This, paired with the fact that some [[Warforged]] would go rouge and attack their masters on occasion, made for very bloody battles.\n\nThis forced [[The Triumvirate]] to reconsider their disputes. The world had changed so much and it was evident how little [[Zol]] knew about itself. The kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] struck and agreement to stop the conflict, and release all slaves that were [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].\n\nPolitical amicability grew over time, but cultural divide never faded. Still to this day there is great disdain between the people of [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]].\n\nSince the concord, no major conflicts between kingdoms has arisen.","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/True-Form":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"True Form\"\n---see [[The Glassius Reach]]","lastmodified":"2024-02-12T16:15:54.346015219Z","tags":null},"/Uroga-Hag-of-the-Sea":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Uroga, Hag of the Sea\"\n---*Void God of Fathoms, Major Deity*\n![[uroga.png]]\n\nQueen of the deep, the most powerful of the mysterious [[Hags]]. she who commands the horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean.

All of these deals come at a great price. These deals typically involve the exchange of power and souls.

It is a relatively uncommon, and unstructured belief system. It is based in the idea that [[Gods]] are not infallible, divine entitles. Rather that they are beings who hold a great deal of power, and are actually more likely to make mistakes because of it. [[Wanderian]] scripture teaches the idea that individuals must learn to live in a world where [[Gods]] are imperfect, and that one should hope that [[Gods]] reflect this same perspective.\n\nThese ideals are taught in the scriptures of [[The Wandering Gods]]. A group of strange [[Gods]] believed to be of some alien origin. [[Wanderian]] belief says that [[The Wandering Gods]] are beings who seek to teach, rather than rule. It is said they came to [[Zol]] after [[The Undoing]] from some far off place in [[The Cosmos]].

It is most often practiced on an individual level. However, there are a few churches that do exist. These places do not have the grand hierarchy that larger belief systems like [[Trinaism]] and [[Dorian]] belief do.\n\nChurches formed in honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] may be organized to honor all of [[The Wandering Gods]], or just one of them.

In a place where the scale of physical and magical power is vastly different on either end, warfare can become far too dangerous if not kept in check. There is a set of unwritten rules used by kingdoms and cities in warfare, lest the battles become too destructive.\n\nIt is typically fought by armies of soldiers of comprised of individuals or relatively low power, without much magic to their disposal. Dispatchments of normal individuals, who have been trained to wield simple weapons, and fight on behalf of their kingdom. When the battles become more significant in their impact, opposite sides of the conflict may start to bring out more dangerous weapons and fighters. However, this task must be carefully managed, as retaliation can cause for exponential growth in the destructive forces used on either side.\n\nThis practice comes from lessons learned in the early days after [[The Awakening]]. Many cities rose and fell, as the battles were extremely destructive. It is also one of the reasons new kingdoms and cities don't often appear. They would not have the resources to sustain a battle that exceeded their level of strength.\n\nThere are a few well known examples of this destruction getting out of hand:\n- The introduction of [[Warforged]] into the [[Triumvirate Battles]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]'s alliance with The Maul Bearer during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]\n- [[The Word of Wrath]]'s sudden appearance at the end of the [[Western War]]\nMutually assured destruction maintains a balance amongst warring kingdoms.

Some say [[Warforged]] were discovered, while others say they were created. Their bodies are comprised of engineered materials, and extremely complex [[Iron Light]] configurations. [[Warforged]] were originally used as soldiers during [[Triumvirate Battles]]. Their effectiveness in battle changed the shape of the conflict so quickly, that it brought the centuries long conflict between [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] to an end. However their usefulness to the mortal world did not end there.\n\n[[Warforged]] became a mechanical slave race of people for the kingdoms of [[Zol]]. Made specifically to serve, their treatment became a thing of great debate. Some think that since they are machines, they do not need to be treated as people. While others believe that they are to be liberated, as they bear a soul. Unfortunately for the latter group, their voice is the minority. This is largely due to the fact that [[Low Automata]] existed prior to [[Warforged]]. This makes it so the complex, and sapient [[Warforged]] are often compared to the mundane [[Low Automata]]. In the late [[Second Age]], [[Warforged]] servants have become so commonplace that even [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], which is famous for its anti-slavery laws, allow [[Warforged]] servants.\n\n[[Warforged]] who are created for the purpose of serving, do so willingly. The beings themselves do not seem opposed to their original purpose. However those who are not created for a purpose have been observed pursuing greater meaning. Some even 'liberate' other [[Warforged]]. This is done by subduing servile [[Warforged]] and making modifications to their [[Iron Light]] runes within. These 'liberated' [[Warforged]] also go on to pursue greater meaning.\n\nOccasionally, [[Warforged]] will go 'rouge'. This is caused by issues with or damage to their [[Iron Light]] configurations. Nine times out of ten, this results in violent outbursts, and thoughts of insanity for these [[Warforged]]. A rogue [[Warforged]] is an extremely dangerous thing.\n\n[[Warforged]] can be all shapes and sizes, perhaps in the most literal sense. In fact, the first [[Warforged]] was a highly complex writing utensil created during the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] at [[The University]]. They are constructed to best fulfil their purpose, but most have the ability to swap out non-integral parts such as arms and legs.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | Unknown |\n| Height | N/A |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- The name ''[[Warforged]]\" was first given by the humans who constructed them at [[The Kybis Assembly]].
