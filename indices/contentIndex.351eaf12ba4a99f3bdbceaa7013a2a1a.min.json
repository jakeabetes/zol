Most of the kingdoms resources were allocated to the coast of [[The Narrow Sea]] defending its borders against [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThis left South Kapesh without much of its normal defenses. Distant from the conflicts in the north east, a young [[Half-Orc]] man named [[Eirmond the Brave]]. Son of a prostitute, Eirmond was forced to watch the mistreatment of his mother and many others his whole life. When his mother was killed by an enraged human customer, he decided to begin a rebellion of his own.\n\n[[Eirmond the Brave]] and many other [[Off-Human]] slaves, primarily [[Orcs]], took [[Ka'thoor]] with great bloodshed. Despite the losses, it was the first time rebels had taken a city in [[Kapesh]]. Rumors spread quickly, and another rebellion was sparked in [[Hanen]]. After much fighting, and aid from rebels in [[Ka'thoor]], [[Hanen]] was taken as well.\n\nHuman nobility were executed, and the lower human population would likely have been as well, if not for Eirmond's mercy. These individuals were given a choice, aid the rebellion or face exile. Many resisted and some chose exile, but a sizeable group decided to stay and fight alongside rebels.\n\n[[Deepspell]] was the next strategic foothold to take, it was a difficult city to seize, especially with the aid of [[Kerketh Academy]] and their mages. It is likely the city never would have fallen, if not for a group of open minded students led by Alex Laro-Rissan, a charismatic noblemen's son who began a movement to stop the mages of the academy from fighting the rebels. Some say it was an act of honor, while others believe it was done in defiance of his parentage. Eventually it broke out into infighting within the academy. Ultimately rebels prevailed and the border between north and south [[Kapesh]] was secured.\n\nIt was at this time, the city of [[Holocene]] surrendered without prompt. The city and their nobles were kept safe and it became one of the rebels cities. This annexed the southern half of the region off from north [[Kapesh]].\n\n[[Rails]] and [[Zessgorn]] were taken soon after. [[Zessgorn]] notably by a group of slaves already within the city. This only left [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, this was when [[Kapesh]] began making headway with their counter-attack. [[Ka'thoor]] was retaken, and the human forces then moved on to [[Hanen]].\n\nRemarkably, [[Hanen]] held out against 3 major attacks by [[Kapesh]] with no support, and almost no resources. This one in a million chance forced [[Kapesh]] to retreat to [[Ka'thoor]]. They were ambushed by the forces of [[Holocene]] during this retreat, and [[Hanen]] was secured once again.\n\nThe rebels eventually retook [[Ka'thoor]], and all attention was turned on [[Tenzentak]]. The city's rough outskirts and defensible position made it for a long drawn out battle. It wasn't until a well trained group of [[Tabaxi]] rebels scaled the cliffs edge in great numbers and broke the outer walls defensed from the inside. In this victory the rebels took south [[Kapesh]] in its entirety. \n\n## The Founding of The Free Cities of Alderun\nAfter [[Tenzentak]] was taken by rebels, [[Kapesh]] attempted to retake [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Deepspell]], but were unsuccessful. The region was in a state of chaos, but had a hopeful air to it.\n\nEirmond and representatives from the cities met in [[Rails]] to establish a new government. The [[Alderian Council]] was formed for this purpose. A group of representatives, one from each of the cities, to serve the purpose of maintaining each city, and upholding the laws and values. The region was renamed [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Alderun meaning *hope* in [[Orcish]].\n\n[[Kapesh]] did not recognize them as a kingdom for many years, but eventually caved to political and military pressures.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.844306915Z","tags":null},"/Amplidation":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Amplidation\"\n---# Amplidation\n[[Amplidation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

Individuals can send messaged over a great distance by writing on one surface, causing its counterpart to automatically make the same movements. It is crucial both implements are level so movements are transmitted accurately. This means that span reads do not operate well in the sea or sky unless gyroscopic in their make. Devices are connected to each other via signets. Simple span reads have a single hard set partner while the more intricate ones have swappable signets or ones that can be configured to fit the user's needs. Many who utilize span reads will do so through a third party operator (usually a business) that will ensure their message reaches the intended target, assuming their recipient is included within their extensive archives of contacts.|\n| Iceless | A sealed box with an iron rod that moves heat along it from the inside of the box to the outside to preserve foods within. A heatsink attached to the outside of the box is connected to a mechanism that requires regular winding (usually daily) to properly distribute heat. The device also requires an operator be near by bearing a corresponding signet ring.|\n| Light Lock | A magical lock that only works with specific individual keys rather than any key that fits the correct pattern. Making forced entry very difficult. |\n| Illusion Lamp | A magical lamp that utilizes illusion light. Eliminates the need for fuel and fire hazards. Requires a being possessing [[Vizir]] to be within a relatively small range (around 100ft) for operation. |\n| Eversharp Steel | Blade edges that resist becoming dull. |\n| Everhard Steel | Metal that can withstand more damage than it should be able to. |\n| Burn Filter | A small devices that evaporates water and reconsolidates it into filtered, drinkable water. These devices are known to be short lived as the they are cheap to produce in a disposable manner, and especially hard to produce a lasting version|\n| Vizir Alarm | A device that makes sounds when a being with a [[Vizir]] enters within its radius |\n| Iron Lighter | A device that produces a small temporary flame |\n| Twinned Bells | A set of bells that all toll when any single one of them toll |\n| Chronomantic Clock | A time telling device that leverages the simplest properties of [[Chronomancy]] for its function. |\n| Compass | A device that can be programmed to point north, or at a specific point in space given the device was originally activated at that location. |\n\n## Complex Apparatum\n| Name | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Sending Stone | Devices that have the capability of transmitting voice messages to other sending stones over great distances. Operating similarly to Span Reads, but transmitting sound rather than pen strokes. These devices also require signets in their implementation. |\n| Holdings | Containers that are larger on the inside than the outside, allowing for great storage |\n| Automail | Prosthetic limbs that give sense of touch, and sometimes abilities greater than that of its biological counterpart |\n| [[Warforged]] | A race of beings formed from [[Iron Light]]. These individuals can be made to very specific specifications to excel at specific tasks. In modern day, these individuals are constructed to be servile. |\n| Archival Index | A terminal device that can be used to index information within a library for easy retrieval. |\n| Space Engines | Devices that can convert empty space into motion. The method of motion used in [[Trains]] and [[Airships]]. These devices are known to create extremely low temperatures so they typically use coal heat to prevent ice crystals (which could damage the ferric runes) from forming. |\n| Mass Reducers | Devices that are integrated into the whole of greater Apparatum to reduce their overall mass. Used in [[Airships]]. |\n| Firearms | A classification of projectile weaponry that leverages [[Iron Light]] for destructive capabilities. These devices can launch many types of ammunition depending on how they are made. In most hands these are far more efficient than bows or crossbows, but are expensive to acquire and maintain. In modern times a non-magical equivalent that uses black powder has been used widely, but these are not nearly as effective as Iron Light Guns. |","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.848306872Z","tags":null},"/Arcadia":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Arcadia\"\n---See [[Laenwalde]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.848306872Z","tags":null},"/Arcana":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Arcana\"\n---# Arcana\n[[Arcana]] is the third of the wills.

Friend turned on friend as everyone within began to do all they could to destroy the city and its people.\n\nBrave heroes dispatched themselves as quickly as they could, luckily none of which were driven mad upon arrival. They fought the Void God, as it dispatched an army of monstrous demons with horrific physiology.\n\nThe heroes did all they could to wound the strange being, in a manner similar to razing a city. Then without warning, the city vanished.\n\nThose who were driven mad by it suddenly regained their senses, but the damage had been done. In a matter of hours [[Audran]] was put to ruins. The memory of the event left the city with the brand of being cursed.\n\nThe vast majority left the city, and it remained a ghost town for generations. However, most of its buildings were relatively intact, as [[The Castle of Bodies]]' efforts largely damaged the population directly. Eventually, the wounds turned to scars, people began to return to the city.\n\nOriginally only unorganized factions of bandits, forlorn, and nomads. As more people arrived a society naturally began to reform. Eventually the governing bodies of [[Laenwalde]] recognized it as a city once again.\n\nIt had been rebuilt to a degree, Fallen down sections of stone walls were rebuilt with lumber, rubble piles were stacked and reused as building material, and waterways were cleared of pollutants.\n\nLater research and divination revealed [[The Castle of Bodies]]' nature. The attack was deemed as a freak occurrence, and people began to call [[Audran]] home again. However it scars would never be forgotten and it was no longer the capital. [[Kahdinacht]] had taken its place as the defunct capital, and [[Heliodor]] would later be its successor.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.848306872Z","tags":null},"/Ayamot":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ayamot\"\n---# Ayamot\n*Zolaen God of Justice, Major Deity*\n![[Ayamot.png]]\n\nThe Golden Dragon of Justice, father of the metallic dragons.

Ayamot emits radiant light and bears a halo. When not in the form of a dragon, Ayamot is known to shapeshift into any form he choses, most commonly this is that of a mortal man. These shape-shifted forms typically bear his halo.\n\n## Symbolism\nA hand with a triangular void in its center.\n\n## Behavior\nAyamot is known to dole out blessings and justice to mortals who have committed notable actions. These actions can be good or bad. Unlike the utilitarian methods of his fellow god [[Tellab, the Wise]], Ayamot has a very strong moral compass and enacts judgement based on this compass. This approach may be based in utilitarian morals at times, altruistic at others, or some other philosophical razor.\n\nThose who base their morals by his guidance adopt what is called Ayam Morals.\n\n## Realm\nAyamot resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. He is know to spend much of his time soaring through surrounding sky, or perched on the cliffs where he gazes into the lives of mortals.\n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of Ayamot seek guidance in the decisions of their actions based in Ayam Morals. There are many temples and churches built to the honor of Ayamot. Statues of his likeness are commonplace in courthouses all over [[Zol]].\n\n## Father of Metallic Dragons\nAyamot is the progenitor of the Metallic [[Dragons]], and is revered by them as their ruler.

He spilled his own blood into the lakes and rivers of [[Zol]]. Those who drank of the waters were granted whispers of power, and strange dreams.\n\nSome did not notice, or even undergo the affects. Those who did were given the option to follow the instincts of beasts. The afflicted initially felt a pulling sensation to the wilderness. Those who gave in abandoned their old lives to seek the source of this yearning.\n\nThey lived like primal peoples: hunting, scavenging, and howling under moonlight. The more they gave in, the more they grew in their strength. Bestial blood began to fill their veins. It increased their physical abilities, senses, and furthered the odd dreams.\n\n[[Kerndall]] meant for these people to be a legion of strong beings. They could defend themselves with no need for society and laws. Directly experiencing the wonder of nature day in and day out.\n\nFor a time it was a sort of paradise for these people. The towns and cities they abandoned were left in shock and fear of their loved one vanishing to the wilderness, but it was not a lethal event so it did not spark widespread panic. Thought it was not long for the nature of mortals to reemerge in these bestial peoples.\n\nSome of the changed individuals sought more, they hunted larger and larger prey. Consuming them and gaining much more of [[Kerndall]]'s essence through biomagnification. Their greed began to drive the transformation down a dark route. Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city outskirts.\n\nEventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name [[Bloodhunters]], and the hunted were called [[Beastmen]]. Their affliction was dubbed as [[Beast Ire]].\n\nThe beasts were extremely powerful and mad, they took warriors of equal strength to kill them. Many warriors began consuming the blood of the slain [[Beastmen]] in small doses to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of [[Beast Ire]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] sought to stop the affliction but it had taken on a life of its own, tainted by greed and the conflict between mortals and [[Beastmen]]. [[Beast Ire]] became contagious by either bite or being bit by [[Beastmen]] in a nightmare caused by their proximity. As the crisis progressed the people of [[Zol]] went into hiding, and the ailment spread into the cities.\n\n## Symptoms\nThe symptoms of [[Beast Ire]]:\n- The earliest symptoms are typically nightmares and a feeling of power\n- Increased strength, constitution and speed\n- Heightened senses\n- Extreme hunger\n- Aversion of water and sunlight\n- Obsession with lanternlight\n- Madness\n- In its most advanced state, the afflicted will develop any number of beast like traits\n\t- Fur\n\t- Glowing eyes\n\t- Sharp teeth\n\t- Claws or hooves\n\t- Elongated limbs\n\t- Quadrupedal mobility\n\t- Extra limbs\n\t- Increase size\n\t\t- Some rare cases an afflicted will be over 15 meters in length\n\n## Societal Impact\n- The people of [[Zol]] had to hide in their homes save for hours around midday\n- Proximity to the afflicted caused nightmares which haunted the population, and sometimes turned them.\n- Many brave individuals had to become [[Bloodhunters]] to defend the cities and cull the numbers of [[Beastmen]]\n- Some cities fell completely and were left to ruin. Others only fell for a time like [[Little Triumph]], [[Zessgorn]] or [[Reach Run]]\n\n## Resolution\nOne day the contagious nature of the disease stopped entirely. [[Bloodhunters]] were able to kill off the final members of the [[Beastmen]]. It was later revealed to [[Zol]] that [[Kerndall]] had struck a deal with [[The Wasp Eater]]. The affliction would be transferred into [[Kerndall]]'s body, and the spread would cease. [[Kerndall]] would then become the servant of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] was maddened by the affliction and was dubbed [[Kerndall, the Feral King]]. His son [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] took his throne. Slowly, [[Zol]] began to return to normalcy.\n\nSome of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed. They hid in remote locations. After the resolution of [[Beast Ire]], they were granted new forms by [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]]. A cast of peoples now known as [[Beastfolk]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.848306872Z","tags":null},"/Bethar":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Bethar\"\n---# Bethar\n*Wayward God of Craft, Minor Deity*\n![[Bethar.png]]\n\nThe god of mortal creation and artistry. Bethar is a quiet but important god to [[Zol]]. Bethar gives guidance and favor to mortals who seek him. His aid manifests as guided skill and inspiration.\n\nFriend to the [[Zolaen Gods]], Bethar does not join them in their ranks. It is not known by mortals why this is. Some say it is due to his passive nature, while others say he is not of enough import to [[The Watcher]]'s mission. Because of this, the worship of Bethar is typically legal in any place where the worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]] is legal.\n\n## Depiction\nBethar is depicted as a man of older age in fine clothing. He is known to appear as a one of [[The Triumvirate]] races when he manifests. Many people argue his true form being one of the three in specific. This is however, regarded as religious propaganda by most.\n\n## Symbolism\nA tree on a light blue circle, similar to that on his forehead. No one knows the true nature of this symbol.\n\n## Behavior\nBethar is known to form a personal connection with many of his followers. He gives those he forms a bond with great time and care. Existing to them almost as an unseen friend. His mission is to guide mortals along the path of their own creation. To Bethar, creation itself is divinity.\n\n## Realm\nBethar resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], despite not being one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. This is likely due to some relationship he has with them that is poorly understood by mortals.\n\n## Worshipers\nBethar's followers are known to be craftsmen or artists. Few churches exist to Bethar in comparison to many other gods, and those that do are humble in their scale. \n\nCommunion with Bethar usually takes place whilst performing an act of craftsmanship.  This act itself is usually seen as the equivalent of worship or prayer.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.852306828Z","tags":null},"/Cadence":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Cadence\"\n---# Cadence\n*Wandering God, Moral of Adaptability*\n![[Cadence.png]]\n\nManu Modica, Clausula, Cade, Ence, and Mao Leve. Known by many names and many forms, [[Cadence]] is the Wandering God of Adaptability. An ever-bending, forever-changing miasma that seeks harmony for the world.\n\n## Depiction\nCadence is known to create a form for himself from the environment. A constellation of stars and a nimbus of clouds bending to appear as a leporine being. Distant hill top trees aligning to rabbit ears that perk up upon your notice. Steam rising over a pot of soup amalgamating to form his celestial silhouette.\n\nWhen not tampering with the manifestation of the physical world, Cadence appears similarly to a [[Harengon]]. His body has an ancient yet powerful appearance, but his face maintains a youthful appearance.\n\n## Moral\nCadence teaches the Moral of Adaptability. At its core, this ideal teaches one to seek harmony with all things through acceptance of any given circumstance. Stretching ones limit to not only seek survival, but prosperity. Overcoming obstacles by redefining what an obstacle is.\n\n## Realm\nWhen travelling into Cadence's reaches of [[The Unknown Realm]], the ground gives way to a strange cosmic space. Moving in this space is akin to swimming in air. \n\nThe area is jumble of strange but enticing objects floating in the odd vacuum as far as the eye can see. Food, instruments, statues, works of art, books, furniture, even entire buildings constructed with *Non-Euclidean Geometry* bob about the air.\n\nCadence spends his time here crafting these oddities. Academics are not sure as to why he does this, and largely assume it is for his own enjoyment.\n\n## Behavior\nTo the uneducated eye, Cadence's behavior seems erratic and even chaotic at times. He is known to be a trickster who throws mortals into strange situations. His behavior may turn on a dime between generous or demanding.\n\nFollowers of Cadence claim that is is done to *challenge* mortals. it is thought that putting the world in a place where unexpected, but great things can occur sews seeds for Adaptability.\n\n## Worshipers\nCadence's followers are known to be erratic, but endearing. They follow his example, and never let the world predict their next move. They set about the [[Zol]], ever-chaotic, looking to find the most unexpected ways they can serve the greater good.\n\nSome call these folk *Yes-men* and they are known to do random acts like leaving a baked pie on someone's doorstep, or completing unfinished construction projects overnight. Once a group of Yes-Men in [[Arcadia]] shredded every ledger of tax collector in broad daylight, then turned themselves in to law enforcement.\n\nYes-Men organize themselves in regular secret meetings called *The Determining* where goals are set foreword and decided upon by the Yes-Men. These set goals may involve small local projects or large pilgrimages.\n\nYes-Men are proselytizers, always sharing the word of Cadence in the most unexpected manner. Skeptics see them as ne'er-do-wells seeking to disrupt the balance of their preferred systems, while others think they are kind hearted oddities who bring good luck wherever they go.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.852306828Z","tags":null},"/Caster":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Caster\"\n---An individual who uses [[Magic]], usually via a [[Spell]].\n\n![[Caster Diagram.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.860306742Z","tags":null},"/Chronomancy":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Chronomancy\"\n---# Chronomancy\n[[Chronomancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is extremely rare. It is magic that involves the manipulation of ones location on the 4th dimensional plane of [[Nodes]], allowing the manipulation of time.\n\nThis is extremely difficult, dangerous, and frowned upon. [[Chronomancy]] allows one to move backwards, foreword, or even stop time. In all instances movement along this dimension is directly proportional to the users skill. To make things more achievable some users will attempt to send only their perspective elsewhere, allowing them to acquire information while risking much less.\n\nThis magic is used with the intention of keeping ones mind continuous while the timestream is broken. This makes it very difficult to perform. Failures can be cataclysmic, or relatively harmless. In terms of harmless failure, you could go backwards in time, but lose all your memory of doing so effectively accomplishing nothing. Alternatively one could freeze time but also freeze themselves in the process immediately ending the spell, uselessly expending great deals of energy.\n\nMore plausibly things will end up worse. A paradox could be created and cause the timeline to lash. A lashing timeline could manifest as something simple like dozens of surges of wild magic, summoning horrible beasts from the cosmos, or create tears in the planes. They could also manifest as something worse like mile long tendrils of raw energy tearing through the environment, or being removed from existence entirely.\n\nBecause of these high stakes, divine beings are known to intervene and punish those responsible. Academia holds very little knowledge about [[Chronomancy]] for all of these reasons. Only the mad pursue this practice.\n\n## The Chronomantic Wall\n[[Chronomancy]] is a relatively unexplored field due to the dangers involved. However it has been discovered that a seemingly impassible barrier exists at the moment of [[The Awakening]].

It is an uncommon school. It is magic that involves the manipulation of [[Space]]. This manipulation allows a user to increase or decrease the space in a given area.\n\nThis magic is difficult to perform purely based on the sheer amount of focus it requires. It is done by moving the space from one location to another. It can be used to make a room much larger or smaller. Alternatively it can be used to move a target closer or further away from something.\n\nEnvironments changed by this influence are known to adapt intuitively to the changes in space. A room made smaller will have furniture, shrink, restyle or disappear to accommodate. A forest expanded will have plants emerge from the ground instantly in the newly opened expanse.\n\nThese changes however are temporary, and revert back after a few hours. Anything gained in the change disappears, anything lost reappears.\n\n[[Collapsation]] cannot be used to make living things, or magical objects disappear due to interference. If a manipulated space cannot accommodate these things the manipulation will stop at the closest possible point.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.860306742Z","tags":null},"/Conjuration":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Conjuration\"\n---# Conjuration\n[[Conjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

These usages of magic can span great distances [[Planes]] or even cross into other [[Planes]] given the skill of the user.\n\nIt requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.\n\nUsers of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying.\n\n## Teleportation\nTeleportation is an extremely valuable skill to the society of [[Zol]]. Costing great deals of [[Gold]], teleportation is the safest and fastest method to move about [[Zol]].\n\nBefore [[The Great Tracks]], teleportation was the only consistent and safe way to get from once city to another. Making it only accessible to the rich or powerful [[Caster]]s.\n\nTeleportation distance is determined by skill, most who are capable of it can move themselves anywhere within The Three Corners of Civilization. \n\nThis limit on teleportation does make it ineffective for long distance expeditions into places like [[The Vast Sea]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. One may argue that you could teleport very far, rest, then teleport again. This strategy however is unfortunately ineffective.\n\nTeleportation is based on familiarity of the current location, and the destination. The less familiar you are with either of these, the more dangerous the operation. If you are intending of teleporting one thousand miles east, you may end up one thousand feet into solid ground.\n\nThere are methods of mitigating and even completely removing these risks of teleportation. [[Teleportation Circles]] can be constructed and used as origin points or destinations when travelling. These circles take a long time to create. They are highly commodified pillars in society, and well guarded by their owners.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.860306742Z","tags":null},"/Daetro":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Daetro\"\n---# Daetro\n*Wayward God of Fire, Minor Deity*\n![[Daetro.png]]\n\nLord of the flame, [[Daetro]] is the spirit of fire and the molten expanses that exist in [[Zol]].

They also face class discrimination, brutality, and other inconveniences similar to life.\n\nMany odd jobs unique to Apolyatum are available to the souls here, but mostly consist of excavating the cave walls, constructing new homes, and agriculture.\n\nA group of [[Fiends]] known as *The Regal* act as the nobility and policing force of Apolyatum. Many souls spend their days serving them, but some successful souls rise to noble ranks as well.\n\n## The Tomb of Stone\nThe maze of pain. A seemingly endless labyrinth of punishment and monsters. Souls guilty of crimes not quite worthy of eternal punishment are sent here.\n\n![[The Tomb of Stone.png]]\n\nIndestructible monoliths are scattered all over the maze. Glowing with faint green marks that house the souls of those who trapped within the labyrinth.\n\nBeings sent to the labyrinth are forced to play in a horrible, eternal game. They wake up in bodies at the base of the strange monoliths, with the knowledge that there are exits at the far reaches of the labyrinth that may lead to Apolyatum.\n\nThey are forced to make their way through the dangerous maze filled with torturous traps, mechanical monsters, and fiendish abominations. When the damned are inevitably killed within the Tomb of Stone, they wake up in a new body at the base of a monolith, rather than facing the effects of [[The Mortal Coil]]. It is not known how this works, but it is assumed that the bodies used by the punished are not their true form which is instead held within the monoliths.\n\nThis creates a society of beings who live in constant fear. Always running, hiding, fighting, and dying. Factions of these people rise and fall, and even social hierarchies form.\n\nSouls are made to reside here for a set amount of years based on their punishment. They are only allowed to leave once their sentence is complete, or they make it to one of the impossibly far doors leading to other layers of [[Damnation]].\n\n## Zaereza\nOnly two things are known about Zaereza.

Obliteration is an infrequently used tool, possessed by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. A place so grim and terrifying, its existence was once thought to be an impossibility.\n\nObliteration is completely devoid of color, and contains unnamed titans that wield colossal tools used to destroy souls.\n\nIt is not known why [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] destroys dangerous souls.

Frequented by students and professors who look to share drinks and conversations of magic, history, and philosophy. |\n | The Hidden Nook | Tavern | A dark and dingy tavern that the far end of Clay Crest. Known for being a place where you can hire the services of one of the Discredited. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city itself is governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] Lady Zed Dion, a very efficient and beautiful elf woman. Lady Dion is well liked by both the city and the academy as she manages the chaos that a population largely made up of foreign, magical students can bring.\n\nThe academy itself has its own rules and restrictions, and is overseen by The Arch Mages and The Magnate. The city and the academy work in harmony to keep a careful balance between the two entities. This functions well for the most part, but there are the occasional conflicts that vary in intensity.\n\nThe city is well protected by its garrison and vast magical resources.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws. Note that any crime already existing within the [[Alderian Laws]] that could are committed more efficiently via the usage of magic (assault, thievery, detrimental [[Necromancy]], etc.) are punished with a much higher severity than the other free cities.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Discredited Services | High | Those discredited by the academy are not allowed to sell their magical services, nor are individuals allowed to hire them. |\n| Restricted Production of Apparatum | Medium/High | Those who produce [[Apparatum]] of categories deemed dangerous by the academy without documented permission are punished. |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the current day and age, [[Deepspell]] is known to create the best [[Apparatum]] in all of eastern [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city is extremely hard to take by siege due to its location and mages. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]] the city was only able to be taken by rebels because of students within the school that sympathized with their cause.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Many conspiracy theories exist about the academy. Some of which have truth to them:\n\t- The towers of the university reach up far beyond what you see from the outside. Containing 'pocket dimensions' that only the high ranking members of the school can reach\n\t- The academy is secretly connected to [[The Kybis Assembly]]'s campus in [[Archaic]] via underground tunnels that travel through [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]].\n- The academy has a long standing rivalry with [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.868306655Z","tags":null},"/Disclaimer":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Disclaimer\"\n---# Disclaimer\nThis is a fantasy world I originally created for hobbyist purposes.

However there is the inclusion of racial and religious discrimination. This is done for narrative device only. The discrimination is between fictional species of humanoid races and is not based on things like hair, skin, eyes, or anything else that would reflect a more real-world scenario. **In the case of [[Zol]] if there is a racist character they are ALWAYS meant to be a villain**.

Theorized to be a product of [[The First Tongue]], these runes allow for the utilization of [[Iron Light]].\n\nThere are 10 classifications of runes\n\n### Infra-Runes\nRunes that reference the world outside of the topic of magic\n- Connective\n- Material\n- Spatial\n- Elemental\n- Energetic\n- Philosophical\n- Bodily\n- Planar\n\n### Meta-Runes\nRunes that reference magic itself\n- Scholarly\n- Magical\n\n## The Ferric Table\n![[Ferric Alphabet.png]]\n\n## Signets\nA signet is a special pseudo-rune that does not subscribe to the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. A signet is a unique shape included in an [[Apparatum]]. It is either a piece of inlayed iron, or a symbol deeply carved into iron. It is grouped with an informational rune as well as an objective rune. This structure can be used as a unique identifier for an [[Apparatum]], or to communicate between devices if made in sets. Sets must be as identical as possible, typically made via [[Magic]].\n\nIt is imperative that signets are completely unique or they risk interacting with others that are they are not intended to. Some malicious individuals will exploit this weakness, and create devices that will interact with [[Apparatum]] they were not intended to. This can be used to listen in on communications, open doors, and sabotage devices. Some [[Artificers]] counter these attacks by embedding their signets deep within the devices, or hiding false signets.\n\nSome devices implement a modular signets so they can be configured to communicate with many devices. This is difficult to operate skillfully, and even more difficult to create. The shape of a signet only seems to matter upon 2 dimensions, rather than 3. It is not known why this is, likely because of the 2 dimensionality of the [[Ferric Alphabet]], but it makes modular signets much more achievable.\n\nDue to their need to be unique, many [[Artificers]] adopt a unique style to their signets, using them almost like a signature. Hence the name.\n\n## Runic Common\nRunic Common is a cypher popularized by philosophers that creates a one-to-one relationship between the [[common]] alphabet and the [[Ferric Alphabet]].

The land of [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and the peaceful [[Genasi]]. [[Gethsemane]] is an old and unvarying kingdom. Each city rules itself as its own and has its own laws, but the region as a whole operates under a grand allegiance.\n\nTraditions of art, craftsmanship, and magic that date all the way back to [[The Awakening]] are visible all throughout its cities.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Xerul]]\n- [[Mod Dranor]]\n- [[Laelanor]]\n- [[Jerda'll]]\n- [[Ep Drukar]]\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\n[[Gethsemane]] is a lush and beautiful land. It's dominated largely by [[The Forest of Yan Nalora]]. A wood of massive trees, crystal streams, as well as strange and dangerous creatures. Tucked into the north are its two mountain cities. The peak city of [[Ep Drukar]], and the subterranean city of [[Mod Dranor]].\n\nThese cities, located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]], a grand and perilous range of mountains overlook the garden kingdom.\n\nA second subterranean city is located near central [[Gethsemane]]. [[Jerda'll]] is a kingdom of [[Drow]] built within the colossal caves that wind beneath the land. Filled with underground lakes and rivers.\n\nWhile glorious, the wilds are quite dangerous. There is only a single train in [[Gethsemane]] which runs from [[Laenwalde]] to [[Mod Dranor]] for trade purpose. All other travel is by forest road. Travelers are urged to travel only with the help of a well trained guide, lest the find themselves attacked or lost in the wild.\n\n## History\nAfter [[The Awakening]], the people of [[Gethsemane]] found themselves in consolidated groups made up of members of their own races. These individuals initially met the same hardships as everyone else, however after a short while they learned that they could live symbiotically with the wilds through knowledge, [[Magic]], and a mutual respect for the environments they lived in.\n\nThe [[Dwarves]] mined into the mountains to construct their kingdom of [[Mod Dranor]], and the [[Elves]] built grand cities highlighting the natural beauty which was already present. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered the presence of one another quite early on. These groups were cautious at first, but found that through mutual respect the cities could coexist.\n\nTo the south was a region known as The Badlands. A feudal realm that would eventually go on to become [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] played an instrumental hand in the forming of this kingdom through support of troops and resources during particular hardship. [[Gethsemane]] is especially to thank for the current state of [[Eucaren]], the north-eastern, and neighboring third of [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] are close allies to this day.\n\nAcross [[The Narrow Sea]], the kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] was being formed. They would go on to become a rivalling kingdom for more than a thousand years. [[Gethsemane]] battled [[Kapesh]] on and off in a conflict known as the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. A war incited by racial and religious differences.\n\nIt wasn't until much later (the year 2811) that the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered that there was a whole city of [[Genasi]] located within the far west peaks of the mountains. This came as a surprise to all parties involved, but there was no major issues that arose as the [[Genasi]]'s lifestyle and demeanor was already very on par with the rest of the kingdom. The [[Genasi]] were determined to be [[Off-Human]], a label problematic within the conflicts surrounding the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. However [[Gethsemane]] decided to let the city be as they had remained in the mountains for over two thousand years without ever causing as much as a stir.\n\nIn the late [[First Age]], [[Gethsemane]] and their ally [[Laenwalde]] faced a great deal of political infighting. When investigated, the source of this infighting seemed to stem from [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] masking as important members of their society. This sparked a conflict known as the [[Western War]] where [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] attacked The Reach. It amounted to one of their cities, [[Yorn et Gaul]], nearly being destroyed. The conflict stopped when a very powerful [[Wordbearer]] called [[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]] entered the fray to the defense of [[The Glassius Reach]].\n\nEventually in the early [[Second Age]] [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] set aside their differences and formed the [[The Triumvirate]] Concord to end their fighting.\n\n## Inhabitants\nLargely populated with [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and a small population of [[Genasi]].\n\nSave for the [[Genasi]] city of [[Ep Drukar]], [[Gethsemane]] is an extremely proud and xenophobic kingdom. Each city holds a very important identity and its citizens do not respond well to anything that may harm it. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]] live long lives and spend most of them focused on upholding or improving their society.\n\nThere are members of other [[Races]] sprinkled throughout the kingdom, but these individuals are seen as outsiders. However they may be welcomed in if they have something special like a well honed skill or gift to offer elven society.\n\n[[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] have a mutual respect but tend to view each other as *lesser*. Elves think dwarves are bull headed, slow witted, and do not have appreciation for the beauty in art. Dwarves think elves are weak bodied, frivolous, and unproductive beings. They do cohabitate in some cities, but usually in neighborhoods dominated by members of their own race.\n\n[[Genasi]] are people of tradition. They reside high in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Rarely leaving their territory, they went undiscovered for many many years. When they were found, the cities of [[Gethsemane]] determined that they were a peaceful group and would be welcomed into their borders. In reality, very little changed. The [[Genasi]] remained in their home and the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] didn't bother them for the most part. A few curious members from each population did mingle and explore each other's cities. This behavior sparked a small movement of [[Genasi]] who venture out on pilgrimages into distant society.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom of [[Gethsemane]] are not governed by a single figure. Each city governs itself and its surrounding territory. The kingdoms do not operate as a council like [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], but rather a very strong, millennia old alliance.\n\nEach city cares for its citizens in its own way. Those who have legitimate citizenship do not go without even if they are not financially stable. In Elven society it is very rare someone does not strive to contribute in some way to their city. Even if they do not they could still easily find food, shelter, and medicine (but its likely they would be looked down upon if they are able bodied). In dwarven society work is assigned if it is not sought out, and disobeying these orders is seen as criminal. The [[Genasi]] have a socialist approach to their city and their slow way of life rarely raises issues. In all cases the sick and elderly are taken care of without question.\n\nEach city is responsible for creating and upholding their own laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt and culture is very deep seated within the cities of [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThe [[Elves]] are known for creating nature-inspired majesty. They practice nearly every craft one could imagine. Individuals spend their entire lives honing their abilities to great heights. This is visible all throughout their societies. Grand architecture, beautiful clothing, fantastic sculptures and paintings, even their armor and weaponry is awe inspiring.\n\n[[Dwarves]] treasure strength, quality, and practicality. This is visible in their cities, homes, tools, and general ways of life. Known for carving their homes and building directly from [[Kalamdola]], their home mountain. Powerful square architecture, engineered with comprehensive mathematics and geometry.\n\nEchoes of their grand city are seen in their smaller works of craftsmanship as well. The precise support pattern upholding the grand bridges that span over the city are sewn into the hemming of garments. The layouts of crucial buildings are embossed onto their army's shields.\n\nMost important to the [[Dwarves]] is the craft of smiting. The tools, weapons, and armor crafted within the city of [[Mod Dranor]] are the finest in all the Three Corners.\n\nAlmost all the people within the kingdom all follow some version of Trinity-Centric or Zolaen-Centric belief.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademics and Magic within [[Gethsemane]] are taught exclusively through mentorship. Nearly all individuals the kingdom spend the first centaury of their life under the mentorship of a set of teachers who specialize in different crafts. Individuals will go on to specialize in craftsmanship, art, magic, academics, or some other career. They will typically go on to spend the majority of their lives in this profession.\n\nNotably, [[Gethsemane]] does not implement [[Iron Light]] as abundantly as the rest of the Three Corners does. This is due to a deep seated pretention around the concept of [[Great Magic]], a highly debated racial issue regarding [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] being more magically gifted than [[Off-Human]] races. This held belief has made it so [[Artificers]] of [[Gethsemane]] utilize [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] for the production of their magical implements. [[Iron Light]] does exist within the kingdom, it is just uncommon and looked down upon.\n\n## Political Climate\n[[Gethsemane]] has a very static inner political structure. The people of the cities have great love for their rulership, and the rulers themselves are all on good terms with each other. There is no one ruler or capital, but outsiders tend to view [[Xerul]] as its defacto capital due to its resources, size, grandeur, and mythos around the [[Elves]].\n\nThis makes [[Gethsemane]] a powerhouse of a kingdom and all who have trifled with them have paid the price. Historically, [[Gethsemane]] has gone to war with all of its surrounding regions and has never lost. It is not involved in any conflict, but there have always been great tensions with [[The Glassius Reach]] since the [[Western War]].\n\nThe people of the kingdom are largely xenophobic, or racist towards outsiders. This is due to old beliefs held regarding [[The Undoing]] and [[Great Magic]]. A sizeable portion of the population does not support these beliefs, but millennia of discrimination is hard to overcome.\n\n## Military\nTacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] has the smaller military, but what they lack in size they make up for in almost every other aspect. [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] are generally more physically capable on average than any other race. Their long lifespans also make it so that they can become very well trained. On top of that, their legendary craftsmanship gives them a literal edge above their foes. All ships in their navy's double as [[Airships]], meaning they need no sea port. There is good reason [[Gethsemane]] has never lost a war.\n\n## Borders\n[[Gethsemane]] borders the kingdoms of:\n- [[Laenwalde]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n- [[Kapesh]]\n\nIt also has borders on the wilds of:\n- [[Holyfield]]\n\nIt contains a portion of the mountain range known as:\n- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]\n- [[The Blades]]\n- As well it decidedly does not consider [[The East Mounts]] within its borders as [[Elves]] believe the region to be cursed. This mountain range is as far south as some superstitious elves will travel.\n\nIt also has coasts on:\n- [[The Vast Sea]]\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.89630635Z","tags":null},"/Gilligans-Lift":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Gilligan's Lift\"\n---# Gilligan's Lift\n*The way to the old world*\n\nLocated in [[Tenzentak]], and operated by [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. [[Gilligan's Lift]] is a great feat of engineering that gives passage from the top of the high cliffs that overlook [[The Grand Nothing]], all the way to the bottom. The lift operates over thousands of feet and can support extremely heavy burdens. Remarkably, the lift originally used no [[Magic]] in its operation.\n\nDesigned by Odile Gilligan, a gifted Halfling academic woman. Gilligan originally decided to construct the lift only using engineering to spark a movement against [[Zol]]'s over reliance on [[Magic]] wielding individuals. \n\n## Design\nBuilt as a wide platform suspended by a massive pulley system. Energy for moving the lift is drawn from massive turbines affixed to the wall of the cliff. Powered by the massive gusts of wind that blow vertically up the cliffs face, energy is stored in large springs. A wide platform acts as the lift itself, built of strong metals and wood to resists the same gusts that power it. This makes it capable of moving large quantities of personnel and equipment.\n\n![[Gilligans Lift.png]] \n\nSince the invention of [[Iron Light]], magical improvements have been made for durability, defense, and efficiency. However the core functionality remains non-magic due to its ingenious design. In modern days a one way trip of the lift takes 5 hours. \n\n## Impact on Society\nThe lift's operation was given to [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. This is because the guild has a reputation of neutrality on the political scale, making the lift accessible to any who would use it with good intentions.\n\nThe cost of operations and profits are managed by the guild, and nobility of [[Tenzentak]]. Security, maintenance, trade deals, tickets, passenger vetting, and staff are all needed to operate the lift.\n\nThe lifts creation marked the first accessible method of the common person being able to venture to the grand nothing. Previously it was only performed by those capable of teleportation.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.900306307Z","tags":null},"/Giriam":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Giriam\"\n---# Giriam\n*Zolaen God of Agriculture, Fertility, Major Deity*\n![[Giriam.png]]\n\nThe caretaker of mortals.

They affect society by communicating with, or granting power to mortals. Some gods even take a mortal form to move amongst society. These influences can be well intended, or malicious in nature.\n\nThere are many gods that exist in [[Zol]], all with different intentions, morality, and powers. Some gods are supremely powerful, while others are limited in comparison. \n\nThe gods themselves have complex relationships with their peers that are not well understood by the civilizations of [[Zol]], society has organized them into pantheons to better discuss them.\n\n## Main Pantheons\nThe main pantheons are:\nPantheon | Description\n------------ | ------------\nThe [[Zolaen Gods]] | The creators of [[Zol]]. A pantheon of gods who act with [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their king. Doing everything they can to see his image of [[Zol]] come to fruition.\nThe [[Wayward Gods]] |  Beings of [[Zol]] who are as powerful as gods, but do not see [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their ruler. They act on their own accord.\nThe [[The Wandering Gods]] | A group of alien beings who appeared to mortals after [[The Undoing]]. Mysterious in nature these gods not act like the others. Some think they caused the [[The Undoing]], other think they are guardians; protecting mortals from the dangerous whims of other [[Gods]].\nThe [[Void Gods]] | Beings who hate [[Zol]]. They crawled out of the [[Sea of Monsters]] to destroy [[Zol]], and return it to the chaotic feast of power it once was.\n\n## \"God\" as a catch-all term for powerful beings\nThere are many beings who's primary focus is to rule over some dominion as a God. However, these are not the only beings that society refers to as a god. Any being or force of extreme power may be given this title by mortals, despite their true nature.\n\n## Minor vs Major Deities\nMinor Deities are beings who have a great deal of power that gives them a degree of uniqueness and domain over some aspect of [[Zol]]. These beings have the ability to not only influence their domain, but give power to other beings to carry out their will.\n\nMajor Deities are beings who are vastly more powerful than most other beings. Their power and influence is only kept in check by other Major Deities with a contradictory will, or great efforts of coordinated weaker beings. To these creatures, a single mortal is but a blip in the cosmos. \n\n## Wordbearers\nMortals who have achieved the ability to harness [[The First Tongue]] are known as [[Wordbearers]]. They are considered gods by some. It is not known how many [[Wordbearers]] there are, but the ones who are public play a large role in society.\n\n## Cosmic entities\nOutside of [[Zol]] and its planes, beyond the [[The Great Wall of Roots]], there lies an infinite cosmic expanse. Almost nothing is known of this strange outside world, but it is understood that the world of [[Zol]] itself may be the dead body of one of the cosmos' progenitors. \n\nThese progenitors, known as the [[Great Old Ones]] once ruled the cosmos, but were driven away from their former power by some reality bending event. All of what is known about these beings is considered to be legend.\n\nThese beings are known of, but bear little modern significance in the day to day lives of mortals.\n\n## Religion\nA complicated topic in a world with so much power, so many gods, and so little that is understood. \n\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] takes many shapes and forms.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.912306177Z","tags":null},"/Gohzul":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Goh'zul\"\n---See [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.912306177Z","tags":null},"/Gold":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Gold\"\n---See [[Currency]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.912306177Z","tags":null},"/Great-Magic":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Great Magic\"\n---# Great Magic\nGreat magic is a un-proven belief held by a large group of people in [[Zol]]. It was thought that before [[The Undoing]] that [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] all possessed a power called [[Great Magic]]. A supposed innate connection to all the wills, granting a very high degree of innate magical ability. Additionally it was thought to grant a long lifespan.\n\nAfter [[The Undoing]], it is thought that [[Humans]] had their [[Great Magic]] taken from them. This power was them broken down into pieces which were formed into the [[Off-Human]] races.\n\n## Origin of the theory\nOriginal speculation came from archeological finds in [[The Grand Nothing]]. Artifacts from these finds never mention any race other than those of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. Biographical content in these artifacts tells of these races all sharing centauries long lifespans.\n\nThese causes for very polarized beliefs amongst the races of [[Zol]]. Especially when paired with modern history, beliefs, and cultures. However these beliefs are only held by a percentage of the population.\n\n## Social Issues\nDue to this theory, many believe their race is superiors to another. Cause discrimination, racism, war and slavery. Elves and Dwarves who think they are better than Humans. Humans who think they have dominion over the [[Off-Human]] races as their progenitor. Even [[Off-Human]] races like [[Changelings]] who are banished to the edges of [[Zol]] for having the worst traits of Humans. \n\n## Evidence Against Great Magic\nMany adopt the belief of grand magic to support their bias. However just as many, if not more disagree.\n\nThe issue of longevity could be explained by the advancement of technology created by society in [[The Before]]. Meaning [[Humans]] were only able to live as long as other races due to medicine and [[magic]]. \n\nThe origin of the [[Off-Human]] races remains a mystery, but most argue that the origin of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] is unknown as well.

Residing within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Hanen is the smallest of the Alderian cities, but has a reputable history. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. The rebels of Hanen did not have the numbers that were originally needed for its defense. The rebels had overthrown the city, but were expected to lose it against the armies of [[Kapesh]] in the coming assault. Reinforcements could not cross the expanses to support the rebels within Hanen, as South Kapesh was crawling with enemy troops.\n\n![[hanen.png]]\n\n[[Kapesh]] attempted to retake take Hanen by siege, and failed. So they tried again, and failed. They even made for a third attempt and against all odds they failed. It was at this time support from [[Holocene]] arrived. Kapesh would never lay a boot on Hanen soil again.\n\nHistorians and tacticians speculated at what gave Hanen the means to defend their city for so long, but the most concrete explanation is the citizens of Hanen fought exceptionally well. The core reasoning for this exceptional fighting became prevalent over time.\n\nSome people of Hanen posses strange abilities, locally known as 'gifts'. A rare phenomenon, with each individual case manifesting uniquely. These abilities appear as physical or magical boons of power. Some obvious example of one possessing these powers may be able to breathe fire, climb vertical surfaces, see through walls, or manipulate the arc of a thrown object. More subtle manifestations appear as great skills. Some may not even recognize they have a 'gift'. No individual is known to posses more than one power.\n\nTypically these powers are passed down a bloodline with an approximate 1 in 3 success rate. However some citizens may be born with new power at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. The abilities first appear around age 10. Historically the powers have been increasing in frequency and potency. Hence the past confusion regarding the strength of those from [[Hanen]], as the powers used to be quite simple.\n\nEmpowered bloodlines are heavily sought after in modern day. Due to this, most noble houses are 'gifted'. Most notably House Trent. The wealthiest family in which almost all family members are 'gifted'.\n\nThe powers of [[Hanen]] waver if a 'gifted' individual spends more than 10 years from the city, but return fully when near  the city once again. 'Gifts' cannot be passed down when birth occurs away from the city. Some suspect this is because the source of the power comes from the Glass Lake.\n\nIdentifiable by its ivy covered, weathered and off-white stone walls. Hanen is a quaint place, and recommended to any who travel. Due to Hanen's location and strong population, it has one of the safest outer wilds, allowing for expansive farms, and a sense of ease.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | A lucky few of the city's people are born with special powers called 'gifts' |\n| Main Challenge | The presence of these 'gifts' stokes an imbalance amongst the city's people. The 'ungifted' frequently experience mistreatment by some of the 'gifted'. The city's leadership faces many political hurdles in remedying this due to the high number of 'gifted' nobles.|\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Farmed goods, hearty meat-and-potatoes meals, wild game, ales and mead |\n| Export | Agriculture, Mercenaries |\n| Size | Small |\n| City Leader | Poe Abbarand |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Wanderer-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Overgrown war-worn structures, Lakeside |\n| Architecture | Off-white stone walls, ivy covered, clay tile rooves |\n| Color(s) | Green and Gray |\n| Symbolism | A shield bearing three drops of blood arranged in a triangle |\n| Defenses | Lake-Navy, City Garrison, 'Gifted' Elites |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The wealthy and politician class, many of which have 'gifts' due to their family influence over time. |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The working class of farmers, craftsmen, and other service people. Most in the city live good lives, making for few beggars. The largest challenge these people face is the frequent tension cause by living in close quarters with 'gifted' individuals. Many of which have destructive or lethal powers, and a sense of superiority. Some common folk have 'gifts' as well. These individuals are frequently married into noble houses, or keep their powers relatively hidden to avoid social pressures. |\n| The 'Gifted' | Misc. | Locals to the city who are born with unique powers that grant magical or physical abilities. |\n| Church of the Wanderers | Religious | One of the largest congregations of [[Sworn Wanderers]] in all of [[Zol]].

It is unique as most churches built to the honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] are humble in scale. |\n | East District | Market | The vast market district. Packed with many small restaurants and taverns. It notably contains no clear magic shop. Magical items can be found at various vendors selling odds and ends or Artificers' services. |\n | Wagons' | Tavern | A large and simple tavern. The most popular of its competition, frequented by the Common folk. |\n | The Lucky Few | Tavern | A higher scale tavern, frequented by the 'gifted' |\n | Sozaren Academy | Sword's College | An exclusive institution with the aim of training 'gifted' into skilled warriors.

Known to export remarkable fighters. |\n | Hanen Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Hanen Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The City's sole teleportation circle. Located in The Citadel. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by Poe Abbarand, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Hanen]]. Lord Abbarand is an old honorable [[Half-Elf]] man. Despite the cities culture and history, Lord Abbarand possesses no 'gift', despite his bloodline. He has always had a vision of growing [[Hanen]]. It is a small city with no shortage of resources and much potential.\n\nUnfortunately, he spends most of his time settling squabbles amongst the noble houses and cleaning up messes caused by the 'gifted'. Despite his honor and efforts, his inability to exercise his authority upon the 'gifted' has given him a reputation of being spineless.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Misuse of 'gifts' | Medium | If one uses their 'gift' to harm, intimidate, or manipulate another without due cause they are to be jailed in the keep's dungeon. (Note that despite this laws existence, it is rarely enforced. If it is enforced, the sentencing is very short.) |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, Hanen is known for giving rise to many strong warriors that make an impact all across [[Zol]]. \n\nIt is also known to be a nice destination to visit. This is because of its safe location between [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Hanen]]. This allows one to venture out into the wilderness with little risk. A rare thing in eastern [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nKnown for withstanding siege during the [[Alderian Rebellion]] against impossible odds.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- It is expected in the next centaury, the presence of 'gifts' and their power will plateau.\n- Many 'gifts' give moderate power, but there are the special few who's abilities far exceed that of their peers.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.912306177Z","tags":null},"/Heliodor":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Heliodor\"\n---# Heliodor\n\n## The Creation of Heliodor\nLong after [[Laenwalde]] had recovered from the [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack on [[Audran]], the kingdom was still without a clear capital.\n\nTo remedy this, the nobility came up with a frivolous design that [[Artificers]] of [[The University]] made into reality.

Many want to leave, but the water from the city's spring is tainted with the minorly addictive [[Chalkstone]]. Making leaving quite difficult if you have drank it all your life.

Many thing Lord Leonell Vanveld is the richest person in all of [[Zol]].\n\nLong ago. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]], the city gave up their rule willingly to the rebels. At the time this seemed an act of grace, or possibly fear. In modern day, many believe it to be a long drawn out plan by the nobility to preserve the rule they have always had. Albeit modified to match the modern political climate.\n\nThe result is a cleverly planned out city that is very hard to access if you are not invited, or cannot afford it.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Inner City Membership | Low | One is not allowed within the city unless they have the proper documentation. This membership can be given temporarily if an individual pays a steep daily rate, or an inner city citizen fills out the proper documentation for a guest. Alternatively the city's high nobility may grant permanent citizenship. Infractions may result as fines, imprisonment, or temporary/permanent banishment |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the modern day, [[Holocene]] is seen as a city of exclusive art and culture. Its rules and restrictions are almost oppositional to the ideals of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Holocene]] was the first city to surrender during the [[Alderian Rebellion]], and the only one to do so willingly. In modern day this is seen as a clever ploy to maintain the city's aristocracy.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Urban legends of The Spring tell of secret passages into the inner city, but if they truly exist or not is only known by few.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.916306133Z","tags":null},"/Holyfield":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Holyfield\"\n---# Holyfield\n![[Holyfield.jpg]]\n\ndescription\n\n## Points of Interest\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\n\n## History\n\n## Inhabitants\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\n\n## Academics and Magic\n\n## Political Climate\n\n## Borders","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.92030609Z","tags":null},"/Humbelons":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Humbelons\"\n---# Humbelons\nHumbelons are a unique symbol within the city of [[Ka'thoor]].

Magical feats accomplished without the usage of Iron light. They are more powerful, valuable, and harder to utilize. Their name comes from their elusive, mysterious and permanent nature.\n\nEncapsulating how any [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] is utilized is nearly impossible as there does not seem to be any sort of limit of methods. Some techniques are:\n- Magical Blacksmithing - A practice involving the use of magical metals and expert smithing to produce magical tools and weapons. This has a very wide cultural significance in the stories of [[Zol]], specifically amongst [[Dwarves]].\n- Grand [[Alchemy]] - A practice involving the use of rare substances combined in very specific ways to produce reality bending chemicals and materials\n- Peak Craftsmanship - A practice similar to Magical Blacksmithing that spans a wider range of techniques. A craftsperson who utilizes great skills along with rare magical materials. This could be leather work, fletching, luthiery, or even sewing.\n- Grand [[Arcana]] - The utilization of [[Arcana]] to create, highly complex, specialized spells to modify mundane objects to make them permanently magical. This is bar none one of the most difficult skills one can obtain.\n- Ascendance - Accomplished by leveraging the will of [[Observance]] or [[Viridescence]]. The practice of calling upon a higher power to make a mundane object more powerful. This can be done through prayer, sacrifice, ritual, or trade with this greater power. In most cases this is done with the power of [[Observance]], but there are records of some individuals utilizing the power of nature itself for this effect.\n\nFor a mortal to harness grand forces, it involves understanding the complexities of the [[Magic]] being used, as well as the material you are trying to make the magic permanent within. It is exceedingly difficult to put magic permanently into something that is not magical. To overcome this barrier, most techniques utilize materials that are already magic. The outliers are Grand [[Arcana]] and Ascendance. These creations take serious time and effort. However sometimes spectacular anomalies can suddenly infuse an object with magic without an individuals intervention.\n\n## Perpetuum\nMany uses of magic can cause an object to become temporarily emboldened by magic. This is done by altering the [[Nodes]] that make up an object and, for lack of a better term, *convincing* them posses properties that they do not naturally posses. However, [[Nodes]] are known for being quite static. One can convince a node that it is has new prominent properties while quieting its others for a time, but nodes have a sort of memory of their natural state. They will always entropically tend back to this state, unless this memory is removed.\n\n[[Artificers]] will overcome this hurdle in one of two ways:\n- **Circumvention** - by utilizing materials that are already magical, one can be sure the end product will be magical. However it becomes an issue of magical in what way. One cannot simply make a dagger out of [[Mythril]] and expect it to be able to pierce the hide of [[Dragons]]. It takes great craftsmanship and dedication to be able to make an object with the desired properties. The more skilled the craftsman, the more accurately they can approximate the desired effect. The crafts that use Circumvention are:\n\t- Magical Blacksmithing\n\t- Grand Alchemy\n\t- Peak Craftsmanship\n- **Annulation** - the act of removing the memory held within [[Nodes]] and assigning them new properties simultaneously. This allows [[Artificers]] to utilize any material, even mundane, to create powerful objects with exact properties. This is extremely difficult to achieve and highly dangerous. The memory removal of [[Nodes]] needs to be fully comprehensive as if anything remains the [[Enchantment]] won't be permanent, or may fail outright. Then the infusing with new memory needs to not only include the new properties, but aspects of the original object, lest the object become unstable. A unstable object may cease to exist, or become something unexpected and dangerous. On top of this, these modifications need to happen simultaneously. If any of these steps fail the result could be catastrophic. When not aided by greater powers, complex objects require these Annulations to happen in stages, each feature being added one after the other. The crafts that use Annulation are:\n\t- Grand Arcana\n\t\t- The most notable form of [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] as it is the only method where what is created can be exactly what the craftsman seeks, assuming production is successful.\n\t- Ascendance\n\t\t- Ascendance is very rare and is not know to include the same dangers and complexities as Grand Arcana. This is because the actual Annulation is being performed by a much more powerful being than even a highly skilled [[Artificers]].\n\t\t- The greater being may not create the object to the requester's specifications as they may impose their own will.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.92030609Z","tags":null},"/Incana":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Incana\"\n---# Incana\n[[Incana]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

At its most powerful it can even weave prophecies and change destinies. \n\nManifestations of [[Incana]] are not guaranteed to work.

Zol is never without strife, beauty, hardship, innovation, danger, majesty, mystery, and adventure.\n\nA world thought to have once been ruled by Elves, Dwarves and Humans. These races, known as [[The Triumvirate]] used the power of [[The Trinity]] to create an advanced and prosperous society. Sprawling cities of life, art and culture once graced Zol. This was all lost in [[The Undoing]].\n\nNot much is known about the time before [[The Undoing]], or what caused it. Ancient texts tell stories of a heinous act made by the humans. It is thought to have been a scheme that would turn humanity so far from the light, the [[Gods]] punished all of Zol for the crime. Others believe it was caused by [[The Wandering Gods]], the divine alien force that made themselves known to mortals a century after [[The Undoing]].\n\nSince it is not known which gods or forces in [[Zol]] enacted [[The Undoing]], many theories try to explain the event, or cast blame on specific gods. Said blame has caused a history's worth of debate, discrimination, and even war.\n\nRegardless of which force caused it. [[The Undoing]] obliterated uncountable tracts of land, reducing them to dust, creating [[The Grand Nothing]]. All beings were banished to the furthest intact corners of Zol, forcing them to begin anew with no knowledge of the old world. The [[Gods]] refuse any question asked to them regarding the event.\n\nSome believe the final punishment of the humans was to have their [[Great Magic]] stripped from them, and fractured. From this revoked magic, the gods created a cast of new races to bear the burden of humanity's sin. These would known as the [[Off-Human]] Races.\n\nIn their new home, the sapient world began to atone, rebuild, relearn what was lost. Ages passed for Zol. What was once a nation of refugees now resembled a society, but with only a fraction of its former glory. In these times, only the strong and powerful had true agency, as the [[Untamed Wilds of Zol]] were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out. This all changed when the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.\n\nThe powerful mage [[Mordenkainen]] devised a way for the common folk to capture and utilize the magic of [[The Trinity]]. Complex diagrams and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs allowed for simple magical devices that changed Zol forever.\n\nCommunication devices, agricultural advances, medical wonders, and many other wonderful things were created using [[Iron Light]]. Most notably, [[The Great Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and once unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were given the agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since [[The Undoing]].\n\nNow Zol sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity. A realm formed from the corpse of an infinite being. A developing world wrought with natural mystery, lost history, and unclaimed power. A world where anyone can claim their own destiny.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.92030609Z","tags":null},"/Iron-Light":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Iron Light\"\n---# Iron Light\nIron Light is a unique and efficient methodology used to simplify the usage of [[Arcana]] in the application of [[Enchantment]]. Named after the tell tale violet glow the application gives off, [[Iron Light]] was discovered by the great Arcanist and Academic, [[Mordenkainen]]. Its conception was what began the [[Second Age]].\n\n![[Iron Light Artificing.png]]\n\n*An artificer carving complex Ferric Alphabet runes into an iron slab, its design hidden amongst artistic additions to obfuscate its method of function.*\n\n[[Iron Light]] revolutionized [[Zol]] by putting power in the hands of many who would be otherwise be at the whim of the world. Unfortunately, the technique has also introduced new dangers like new weapons of war, and the [[magic]] ailment known as [[Materiation]].\n\nIn its most simple form [[Iron Light]] devices, also known as [[Apparatum]], are created via engraving special runes called the [[Ferric Alphabet]] into plates of Iron. These symbols channel [[Arcana]] similarly to how one uses their [[Vizir]], with the main difference being the user does not need to know the techniques required to harness [[Magic]]. They can achieve the very specific result allowed by the runes by lending their [[Vizir]] to it.\n\n## Examples of Apparatum\nSome devices made with [[Iron Light]] are quite simple. Blades that dull very slowly, stoves that heat without fire, lamps that glow without fuel, or even simple refrigeration.\n\nOthers are quite complex and powerful. Allowing for things like usage at range, multi-device cooperation, prosthesis, and mathematical estimation. Examples of this are long distance communication devices, flying machines, [[Warforged]], [[Automail]], weather and navigational systems, and even the [[Trains]] of [[The Great Tracks]].\n\n## Production and Economic/Societal Value of Apparatum\nThe creation of Apparatum is proportional to skill, quality of materials, and complexity of the design. Some designs take hours, while other take days or weeks. Individuals who create [[Apparatum]] are known as [[Artificers]].\n\nAs it takes much training to complete even a simple [[Apparatum]], they are costly. Those of the lowest economic status would be lucky to own even a single [[Apparatum]], while those of common wealth will typically own one to three. For nobility, [[Apparatum]] are common place items. Their lavish homes are usually full of devices to increase their general quality of life.\n\nIn most civilized cities, there are common [[Apparatum]] that exist for use in business, or pubic benefit. These may be lamps that light the streets at night, or things like the [[Rift Smog]] filters in [[Tenzentak]]. Some civilizations have very particular views on [[Iron Light]]. The people of [[The Ward]] outlaw the usage of [[Apparatum]] based in spiritual belief.\n\n## Advancements in Iron Light\nIron light was originally limited to a small set of [[Ferric Alphabet]] runes, and slow production via iron engraving. Soon after the name was widely adopted, more symbols and compatible materials, and techniques were discovered.\n\nThe mediums to support Iron light spread to carpentry, glass working, alchemy, leathercraft, weaving, painting, smiting, and various others. Each with their own pros and cons. However some materials like obsidian and silver are inert.\n\nThe name, which references the purple light the runes emanate when active had already stuck. Fortunately, all techniques require some iron to be present to work. Be it metal inlay, infused materials, or special tools used in creation.\n\nA very popular and reliable technique was discovered for short term Iron Light solutions. A special material called [[Chalkstone]] was found to be very compatible with iron and allows for quick, and relatively accurate creation of [[Apparatum]] that last a small number of months. This is commonly used in novice work, prototyping, mass production, and education. Unfortunately devices made with chalkstone are easily destroyed by water damage.\n\n## Discovery\nThe Arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] at the end of the [[First Age]]. He observed common patterns in the damage created by [[Magical Backfire]]. By intentionally increasing the damage of [[Magical Backfire]], he was able to spot runes amongst the damage.\n\nOne of these runes was found to appear elsewhere. In [[Necromancy]], a phenomenon called a [[Death Scar]] matched exactly to [[Mordenkainen]]'s findings. This led to many other successive discoveries of similar nature. These found runes would later be called the [[Ferric Alphabet]].\n\nAfter much experimentation with the runes, their interaction with iron was discovered. A decade of experimentation led to a single working lamp, and a basic theory of [[Iron Light]].\n\nLittle is known about why [[Iron Light]] actually works. It is widely accepted that there lies something within the properties of iron that mimics a living body, allowing it to share the powers of one's [[Vizir]].\n\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is assumed to be some product of [[The First Tongue]]. Since there is very little known about the origin of both subjects, the practice largely operates on assumption in this area.\n\n## The Ferric Alphabet\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is a wide set of runes that represent the aspect of [[Zol]] like [[Space, Matter, and Energy]] as well as the complex relationships between them. These runes are organized in an infinite amount of configurations to accomplish [[Enchantment]].\n\nThe alphabet is thought to be incomplete, and many academics spend their lives searching for more runes. Missing runes are symbolized by the combination of known runes, this is referred to as [[Imperfect Representation]]. For example, glass is represented with light and stone, along with a complex nexus of supporting runes to ensure the combination is successful.\n\n## Negatives to Iron Light\n[[Iron Light]] is revolutionary due to how accessible it makes [[magic]], but it is not nearly as powerful as [[Enchantment]] made from [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] also demands the usage of one's [[Vizir]], and in turn can be very exhausting if overused. Long term usage of complex [[Apparatum]] causes a rare magical disease called [[Materiation]]. This is only seen when the Apparatum in question requires an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. \n\n[[Materiation]] causes the afflicted's body to slowly change to a different material state. It is most often seen amongst [[artificers]] and those who operate complex [[Apparatum]] as a part of their career.\n\nThis could manifest as holes in the body that slowly pour out smoke, appendages that become plantlike, or famously like the conductors of [[The Great Tracks]] who turn to iron. Though gruesome, the condition is painless and described by the victims as euphoric.\n\n## Iron Light in relation to Imbuement Perpetuum\n[[Iron Light]] [[Enchantment]] is limited due to the fact it depends on the Vizir of an individual. Its more powerful counterpart, [[Imbuement Perpetuum]], is not limited in this way. Objects of this nature are much more rare and powerful.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.924306046Z","tags":null},"/Kalamdola":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kalamdola\"\n---# Kalamdola\nThe home mountain of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]].

Known for its resilience, arcane knowledge, and deep seated religious culture. The Kingdom is under the reign of the [[Galliard Crown]], and most of its people follow the [[Church of Three Fires]]. Kapesh has fought many a battle against both of its neighboring kingdom, and faced the dangers of [[Zol]] more fully than most other places. It has stood the test of time and has the scars to prove it.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Archaic]] - The Oldest City\n- [[Viscera]] - The City that Never Sleeps\n- [[Stigmata]] - The City of Three Fires\n- [[Little Triumph]] - The Small City\n- [[Kierketholl]] - The Grand Capital\n- [[Riverbridge]] - The Island City\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nThe Wilds of [[Kapesh]] consist of strange expanses, and dangerous forests that spill over from [[The Witchlands]]. While unsafe, [[Kapesh]] contains natural beauties and wonders unlike that of any other region.\n\nDeep valleys holding winding rivers, flora and fauna that thrive in its mist covered wilds, and open landscapes marred by magical warfare that left hauntingly elegant scars.\n\nIts climate is largely temperate allowing for cultivation of many crops, so long as the farms can survive the lurking threats outside the city walls.\n\n## History\nKnown for its old ways, magic, and grit. Kapesh is ruled by [[King Galliard]] from its capital, [[Kierketholl]]. Kapesh is the oldest kingdom in Zol, as it was founded shortly after [[The Undoing]]. The [[Humans]] were scorned by the elves, dwarves, and gods. This made lives for the people of [[Kapesh]] more difficult at first, but quickly gave humans a reason to unify at a much faster rate than any other faction in all of [[Zol]]. [[Humans]] are known for their stubbornness and resilience in the face of resistance.\n\nKapesh's borders once included what is now the [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. When Kapesh first rose to power, all [[Off-Human]] races within its borders were heavily oppressed and many were forced to live as slaves. This was changed by The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. A civil war in which Kapesh lost its southern region to what is now known as The Free Cities of Alderun.\n\nThere is lots of superstition that regards humans as cursed, this belief is furthered by the problems that Kapesh has faced over the course of its existence. A kingdom located in a considerably inhospitable region filled with monsters, as well as a frankly volatile population. It has faced unique and isolated plagues and famine at various times through out its history. \n\nThey are also known for waging war in the past against [[Gethsemane]] multiple times. Known as The [[Triumvirate Battles]], the conflicts never amounted to much other than unnecessary deaths. The only territory that has ever changed hands in this exchange was Stalke Island and the city of [[Riverbridge]].\n\nKapesh is home to many practitioners of [[Arcana]], most notably at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. Little fact is written on what exactly occurs there. On its surface it is a scholarly place of magic. The rumor mill however, spins stories of arcanists who tamper with the dark unknown forces of Zol.\n\n## Inhabitants\nKapesh is primarily inhabited by [[Humans]], but in modern day there are smatterings of diversity here and there. The most diverse city is ironically the capital [[Kierketholl]]. This is largely due to the fact anyone can slip away into the dense city to find a safe corner of their own to reside in.\n\nThose who live out in the wilds are either sturdy bandits, or natives to [[The Witchlands]] who care not for the borders of civilization.\n\nMonsters and thieves make straying from the roads of [[Kapesh]] dangerous for all who cannot hold their own.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom is ruled by the [[Galliard Crown]]. [[King Galliard]] was brought to power when the discovery was made that the Galliard Bloodline had the ability to control [[The Crown Golems]]. This caused the Galliard line to be married into the royal lineage, and after a few generations they were seen as the most powerful family in all of [[Kapesh]].\n\nThe kingdoms economy favors only the wealthy. Many low born work hard days for little coin, while the nobility accumulate wealth. \n\nThese systems are upheld by the [[Kapeshian Laws]]. Which protects its citizens and bolsters the wealthy with devices like slave labor.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\n[[Kapesh]] is not known for being particularly artistic itself, but it one of the largest consumers of imported arts. The art and culture that does exist largely consists of literature and religious art.\n\nThe culture of [[Kapesh]] revolves mostly around the concept of [[Religion]] (specifically the [[Church of Three Fires]]) and propaganda for the crown.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nThe kingdom's education and magic is almost exclusively associated with [[The Kybis Assembly]] and its archives. There is private tutelage that occurs on a small scale, and the occasional new institution that crops up here and there. If these new institutions gain any traction they are usually absorbed by the assembly, or dissolve after a short while.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe political climate of Kapesh is not considered a pleasant one, but it is very constant. There is bad history with both of its neighbors, and its people are fairly xenophobic. In modern day it has resolved to a sort of reluctant amicability, and commercial trade is conducted.\n\nWithin the kingdom itself, the lowborn are constantly doing everything they can to scrape by. The vast majority blame the crown but many are convinced it is the fault of outsiders. Regardless of the actual cause, most are completely without agency and forced to do whatever they can to get by while those favored by the crown live in luxury.\n\n## Military\nThe Kingdom has a very sizable military for its population. This is achieved through military propaganda and required service during times of war. [[Kapesh]] is not a kind kingdom, but is very effective. It has an average military in port at [[Riverbridge]]. Its troops are also supplemented by mages from [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n\n## Borders\n[[Kapesh]] borders the kingdoms of:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n\nIt also borders the wilds of:\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.928306003Z","tags":null},"/Kapeshian-Laws":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kapeshian Laws\"\n---# Kapeshian Laws\nThis set of laws contains many of the main crimes that one could commit within [[Kapesh]].\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Murder | High | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission.

Ka'thoor rests on the border of [[Kapesh]], and is nestled into the mountains. It is a common stop for any who leave or enter [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n![[kathoor.png]]\n\nKa'thoor was once a hub of slave trade during the [[First Age]], and was the first of the now free cities to begin the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. In its victory, Ka'thoor has created a proud, but largely welcoming culture. They keep their history in everything they do to remain a beacon to all of [[Zol]].\n\nKa'thoor is now a hub of trade related to rare foods, materials, collectables, and art. This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor. As well as [[Kapesh]] merchants who seek the rare goods sold within the city.\n\nDue to its oppressive history, the city does not have nobility. Its leaders are required to live humble lives. In fact many of the people of the city do what they can to maintain humility. One of the ways this is expressed is by doing favors for one another. Many members of the city's population wear unique earrings, called [[Humbelons]], that advertise favors and skills they wish to offer to those in need. These may indicate a wish to give food, housing, repair, and even academic or religious teachings. These earring have become almost a symbol of status, where one is seen as more high standing the wider the variety of earrings they wear. It has gone to the point where this is almost a problem that serves the opposite of what it is trying to achieve, as some wear a ridiculous amount of earrings to appear greatly (and falsely) humble for the status.\n\nAlong side those who bear [[Humbelons]], there is an almost opposite group of those who are very proud. These individuals focus on strength, merit, and honor. This section of the populace refer to themselves as Bloodkeepers. Their maxim is one of combat and honor. The prideful Bloodkeepers see themselves as those who preserve the fury and strength that began the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. \n\nThese two groups live unharmoniously. Bloodkeepers see the humble members of society as weak, and that they uphold a modern version of the oppression the people once faced. The humble citizens see the Bloodkeepers as barbaric, arrogant, and uncivilized.\n\n## Humility vs Pride: The Ka'thoorin Discourse\nWithin Ka'thoor, about half the local population finds themselves on a spectrum of beliefs that spawn from the city's difficult past involving slavery and rebellion.\n\nOn one end of this spectrum exist the Bloodkeepers. These individuals are proud warriors who seek to honor those who fought for their freedom during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. These individuals are know to be loud and proud. They train to be fearsome fighters and seek to *preserve* the fury of their ancestors. Many of these individuals are skilled and honorable warriors wo do well in the upholding of their peoples fighting spirit. Unfortunately others are violent brutes who see it as 'their turn' to be in power. This group is seen as heroes from some perspectives, and bullies from others.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum exists an unorganized group of people who follow a unique philosophy and social practice. These individuals are extremely giving and humble. They swear to pacifism and bear simple colored earrings called [[Humbelons]]. These earrings illustrate services and skills these people giving willingly to any in need. This practice is maintained as a sort of defiance to the masters of their ancestors. When the people of the city were enslaved, their masters did nothing but take and consume. In modern day the people of Ka'thoor are free. Rather than taking things for themselves, some individuals seek to give instead to help ensure the city never ventures down that path again. \n\nThis group has no formal name, but Bloodkeepers refer to them as Bloodless. Some members of this group act as pillars of the community, giving and teaching to any who need it. Other members of this group either give to much and have to barely scrap by, or alternatively wear the [[Humbelons]] falsely for the selfless image and status they give amongst some groups. While many look at these individuals as honorable and kind, some see them as preserving the forced servitude they city once faced.\n\nThese groups are not distinct from one another, there are citizens who exist all over this spectrum. There are even some Bloodkeepers who bear [[Humbelons]]. However, most who exist on this spectrum are closer to the extremes. There is no major conflict between these groups, largely due to the passive nature of those who bear [[Humbelons]], but a tension is obviously visible at times.\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city provides a very unique hub of trade, and an even more unique culture. Many people of Ka'thoor give so willingly that you can probably find any good or service one might need in the city. Alternatively a legion of brave and proud warriors called Bloodkeepers protect the city, and commonly engage in contests of strength and skill within The Kala'dola, the famous colosseum. |\n| Main Challenge | The city's people has 2 very different subgroups within. One of which is overly humble, the other overly aggressive. These two groups live unharmoniously. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Spicy foods, wild game, dried fruits, fermented foods |\n| Export | Trade Hub, textiles, hides/furs, rare goods |\n| Size | Medium |\n| City Leader | Elder Err'del Raeshik |\n| Primary Language(s) | Orcish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Orcs |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric, Wanderer-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Border-City, Foothill Location, Chaotic, Cramped |\n| Architecture | Large stone and wood buildings, vibrant tents and tapestries, structures accented with large beast bones |\n| Color(s) | Red, Black, Light-Red |\n| Symbolism | A chain with 5 links, the center one being broken |\n| Defenses | Bloodkeeper Warriors, Defensible location, Informal alliance with [[Beastfolk]] |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| City Elders | Leaders | Those who are chosen by the city's people to lead them. None of which are allowed to live lavishly. Most of these individuals bear [[Humbelons]] |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The normal individuals of the city. These people live common lives and decidedly do not engage in the antics of [[Humbelons]] or Bloodkeepers. They make up about half the population. |\n| The Humble | Social Class | Those who bear [[Humbelons]]. |\n| Bloodkeepers | Social Class | A warrior class of citizens who seek to preserve their city's pride and honor its history. |\n| Merchants | Economic Group | Merchants from all over [[Zol]]. Many come to trade in the great market of [[Ka'thoor]]. Primarily made up of Alderian and Kapesh merchants. |\n| Beastfolk | Economic Group | Traders who live in [[The Witchlands]] and venture down into the city to trade. They bear unique and rare goods, but have an almost alien air to them compared to common folk. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | The Fortress | Keep | The city's main keep. Does not act as a home for the city's leadership, merely a place of meeting. |\n | Ka'thoor Station | Train Station | They city's train station |\n | Ka'thoor Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle. Located within the Fortress|\n | The Kala'dola | Colosseum | The city's fighting arena, and main meeting place for Bloodkeepers. Many people come here for the almost daily fights. Contains a popular tavern for fighters. |\n | Trade Town | Market District | One of the largest markets in all of [[Zol]]. Full of merchants from [[Kapesh]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]]. Shops open and close in this fast moving bazaar. Many say that if it can be bought it is sold in Ka'thoor's trade town. |\n | The Bone Stack | Tavern | A tavern constructed from cobbled bones of great beasts and fallen warriors. Popular with Bloodkeepers who have distinct anti-human political views. |\n | The Crossroads Inn | Tavern | A tavern located on the edge of Aud at the crossroads of Alderun, The Witchlands, and Kapesh. It is a common waypoint for travelers entering or leaving Alderun, and beastfolk coming to Ka'thoor to trade. The result of this is a tavern where strange, fun, scary, arcane, uncanny, dangerous, disgusting, and beautiful events occur on the daily. There is a sign above the door that reads in orcish \"You are not an adventurer 'till you've spent the night at The Crossroads Inn\". Its gruff, confident, no-nonsense-but-somehow-fun-loving tavern keep, Lep Ka'tesh is an old orcish man that can tell the stories of Zol to a level of detail that rivals that of historians. Literally. A travelling scholar named Ulen Myf from The Kybis Assembly wrote a dissertation titled Tales of the Crossroads in which she retold the stories of Lep Ka'Tesh. They contradicted many historical writings of living scholars. It grew to great popularity out of novelty. The text's new found fame brought the book into the spotlight, so he was invited to The Kybis Grounds for a formal discussion on the topic. The event was later called \"The upturning of Crease Hall\", to this day no victor in the debates was decided, and Lep Ka'tesh is no longer allowed on Kybis grounds. The text holds a special place in the hearts of many scholars because of the event. The copy which was hurled at Lep Katesh by Master Kimmian Vowheart is valued greately, and sits framed above the bar at The Crossroads inn. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by the [[Alderian Seat]] Elder Err'del Raeshik, a wise old orc bearing many [[Humbelons]]. The Elder's of [[Ka'thoor]] are nominated by the community. These individuals are required to live humble lives, and are removed from the position if they are caught accepting any bribe or misusing their authority. \n\nThe garrison is overseen by Bloodkeeper Met'ish Blak. A weathered veteran orc who only takes orders directly from the [[Alderian Seat]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Abuse of Power | High | If a city's elder is caught abusing their power in any way, they are removed from the position. |\n| Refusal of Request | High | Those sporting [[Humbelons]] reserve the right to refuse the provision of a service their humbelons signify. This is beacuse they are an individual before a giver. |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Ka'thoor]] is a strange border town filled with hospitality, and undeniable tension. Some of which is  between its humble and proud locals, even more of which between its off-human locals and human visitors.\n\n[[Ka'thoor]] is a crucial hub of trade in [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]'s economy. It also acts as a very important resource for those who live within [[The Witchlands]], as it is a place they can venture to for supplies.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city was the origin of the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. To this day it remains a defiant beacon of hope for all who have faced enslavement.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Kerndall":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Kerndall\"\n---See [[Kerndall, the Feral King]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Ki":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ki\"\n---# Ki\nA method of harnessing one's [[Vizir]] to enhance the physical body.

[[Kierketholl]] has stood against the trials of war and time like no other city.\n\n![[kierketholl skyline.png]]\n\nThe city is filled with significantly tall buildings, and a handful of megastructures. Most buildings are at least 4 stories tall while the mega structures are around 30 to 50 stories tall.

However he lets the day to day of the city be run by his advisor Lord Ferd Aaron and the royal council.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nKierketholl is the capital of [[Kapesh]] and home to many. Despite it being a human kingdom, the sheer size of the city, and relatively costal location has made it relatively diverse compared to the other cities of [[Kapesh]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nDespite many of attacks during the [[Triumvirate Battles]], the city has held against every attempted attack. This is largely because of [[The Crown Golems]], a magically constructed army that responds only to [[King Galliard]]'s command.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The Megastructures of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Riverbridge]]'s Great Bridges that span the [[The Narrow Sea]].\n- The relationships amongst the human and non human population within the city are tense, and not overshadowed by the strange cultures of the mega structures\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Laenwalde":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Laenwalde\"\n---# Laenwalde\n![[Laenwalde.jpg]]\n\nThe Unified Kingdoms of the West. The largest political power in all of [[Zol]]. Laenwalde is a kingdom formed of the island of [[Arcadia]], the green hills of [[Eucaren]], and the mysterious sands of [[Saen]].\n\n## Cities\nLaenwalde is comprised of the three unified Kingdoms \n- **Arcadia**\n\t- [[Audran]] - The Ruin City\n\t- [[Penthe]] - The City of Glory\n\t- [[Ryze]] - The Tower City\n- **Eucaren**\n\t- [[Kahdinacht]] - Wine and Luxury\n\t- [[Woogis]] - Slow Country Life\n\t- [[Reach Run]] - The Central Hub of [[Airships]]\n- **Saen**\n\t- [[Kosskazoka]] - The Neon City\n\t- [[Diddan]] - The Wild West\n\t- [[Rockfire]] - The Volcanic City\n\nAs well as a shared capital, The Floating City of [[Heliodor]] and its terrestrial sister settlement, [[Nerousea Station]].\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nEach of Laenwalde's three regions has its own natural landscape that differs from its neighbors\n- **Arcadia** - A well mapped and inhabited island. The wilderness of the island is tamed more than most places of [[Zol]], but still presents moderate danger for those unprepared. It's north is full of the snowcapped peaks of [[The Auroran Summits]] which are inhabited by territorial [[Dragons]].\n- **Eucaren** - The wilderness of Eucaren is most associated with the beautiful Madre'ells. A vast expanse of forest covered hills. Known to be the most tame wilderness in all of [[Zol]], this region supplies the people of Eucaren with many resources. While reasonably safe, there are some great threats that reside in the deepest parts of the forest. Its north east contains [[The East Mounts]], a remarkably dangerous mountain range that is thought to be cursed in the teachings of [[Elves]]. Its north west extends into Yaa'Fedell, the forest of the wood elves. This territory was gifted to Eucaren long ago as a thankful gift from the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] for their aid in war against [[The Glassius Reach]]. \n- **Saen** - The Desert of The Three Corners. Saen is possesses great sand dunes, Oases, the mesas of [[The Kodoros]], active volcanoes, and [[The Savanah]]. Its wilderness is extremely hostile but holds resources and treasure that can only be obtained within its sands.\n\nAll of Laenwalde is notably covered in ruins of old forts, castles, towns and other settlements. This is because of the frequent destruction that occurred during [[The Taming of the Badlands]].\n\n## History\nOnce know as The Badlands, a lawless wild of disordered society. Its chaos was quelled over a long effort known as [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. A long history of feudal battles, and large scale wars between various powers that rose and fell in a complicated political and military game.\n\nThis game took a much different appearance after the attack of [[The Castle of Bodies]], a horrible event that involved one of the [[Void Gods]] appearing in the [[Prime Material Plane]] and attacking the city of [[Audran]].\n\nAfter the chaos, a the ruling council discovered a living heir to the first king of [[Laenwalde]]. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed and the new capital [[Heliodor]] was constructed.\n\n*For a comprehensive telling of Laenwalde's history, see [[The Taming of the Badlands]]*\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe people of [[Laenwalde]] hail from all [[Races]] and have many different backgrounds and cultures. After [[The Awakening]], Laenwalde's region was more racially diverse than any other. This set aside many issues other regions faced, but made unification much more difficult.\n\nThe people of each region are stereotyped as follows:\n- **Arcadia** - Thought to be an overly proud and patriotic people. Those who hail from the island think that Arcadia is the 'true' heart of the kingdom as it is where the capital was once from and now homes the strongest military in [[Zol]].\n- **Eucaren** - Thought to be a soft and laid back people. The disproportionate population of [[Halflings]], finest alcohols, and proportionally safest wilderness in all of [[Zol]].\n- **Saen** - Thought to be a rough around the edges people. Gruff gun slinging westerners, dirty beggars of the neon city, or religious devotees of the volcanic temples. \nThe different groups all coexist, but do tend to have a great deal of prejudice. However the people of Eucaren are seen as extremely friendly and unproblematic all across [[Zol]]. They are typically welcomed anywhere.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nLaenwalde is ruled by [[King Tatelak II]] and his advisory council. This rule is conducted from the floating city of [[Heliodor]]. The instilment of [[King Tatelak II]] upon his throne in the flying city was done as an effort to rekindle the hope people once had for [[Laenwalde]]. However many feel there is a disconnect between the crown and its people. They were ruled by a council for so long and now feel that they are under the foot of a distant leader. The King's disposition is well intentioned, but in reality he is inexperienced and it has been a large change for [[Laenwalde]].\n\nLaenwalde's economy is quite self sufficient, the kingdom is large enough to provide all resources they reasonably require. There is a fair deal of trade of rare imports and exports from the east.\n\nThe [[Laenwalde Laws]] are consistent across all regions. This is good for maintaining order, but difficult for some as many feel that the laws should not be enforced as a wide net for all the regions and their cities. They instead push for each region having its own set of laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nThe regions of [[Laenwalde]] all have a unique art and culture associated with them:\n- **Arcadia** - known for upholding the ideals of success, glory and being well mannered. Its ideals are presented in its art in examples like: realism, complex musical compositions, glamorous fashion, and rare foods.\n- **Eucaren** - known for treasuring the ideals of community and the natural world. This is seen in its art as: simple instruments played with a high degree of skill, highly stylized paintings, and dramatic storytelling\n- **Saen** - known for idealizing the concepts of strength and enduring hardship. Its art manifests as martial combat, weapon craftsmanship, large narrative murals, and sculptures.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademia in [[Laenwalde]] is almost exclusively associated with [[The University]]. An institution that explores all three of [[The Wills]] with a dedicated branch of The University:\n- The [[Arcanum]], focused on the pursuit of [[Arcana]]. Its primary campus located within the city of [[Ryze]].\n- The [[Viridium]], focused on the understanding of the natural world through [[Viridescence]]. Its primary campus located in [[Kahdinacht]].\n- The [[Observum]], focused on forming and comprehending mortal bonds with [[Gods]]. Its primary campus located within [[Rockfire]].\nThe [[Arcanum]] is by far the largest branch of [[The University]]. This is because [[Arcana]] best fits to conventional academics. Its counterparts deal with two main factors that make its pursuit much more difficult to approach empirically:\n- The experience of using one of these wills ([[Observance]] or [[Viridescence]]) is very subjective and differs from person to person\n- There is no sure-fire method of gaining the ability to use these wills. They require patience, skill, and a rare predisposition to access\nBecause of this, the majority of the members of these branches are non-magic-practicing academics.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe people of the kingdom are in a strange place. For many years they have been governed by a council. This council was fairly adept at allocating resources and maintaining general order. However the frequent drama, espionage, intrigue, and assassinations that occurred amongst the council appeared as poor rulership to its people. This, mixed with the hardships like: high taxes, overpopulation, conflicts between locals and law enforcement, and clashing cultures made for poor public opinions of rulership and general unhappiness within the kingdom.\n\nIn an effort to combat this, the council instilled a new king. A long lost direct descendant of the kingdom's first, and beloved ruler. [[King Tatelak II]] was put on the throne with the council as his advisors. The new rule is conducted from the new capital of [[Heliodor]].\n\nThis change has altered opinions. Some for better and some for worse. Many think it is good to have a sole king and not the chaotic rule of the council. Others feel that the king is distant, detached, and inexperienced upon his throne in the flying city.\n\n## Military\nTacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Laenwalde]] has the largest army by far. The kingdoms is so grand and diverse it makes up for any lack of quality with quantity. The only hope an outside foe (other than possibly [[Gethsemane]]) would have of defeating them would be to re-open the political divides that exist between the three regions.\n\n## Borders\nThe Kingdom contains the mountain ranges of:\n- [[The East Mounts]]\n- [[The Auroran Summits]]\n- [[The Kodoros]]\n\nThe Kingdom Borders the Kingdom of:\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n\nThe Kingdom also Borders the Wild of:\n- [[The Kulpis Desert]]\n\nAnd has coasts on:\n- [[The Archsea]]\n- [[The Vast Sea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Lent-Power":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Lent Power\"\n---# Lent Power\n[[Lent Power]] is magic channeled by, or taken from some source other than that of what exists in ones self.

[[Limbo]] is thought to be a dead plane that was consumed by [[Goh'zul]] and brought from the void to be used by [[The Coilwalker]].\n\n[[Limbo]]'s surface is is barren, covered in an ever present grey light and dead plants.

Each individual who utilizes this will does so in a manner that is entirely unique to them. It can manifest as a radiant light that guides those who are lost, a dark power that draws in the vulnerable, and everything in between.\n- [[Viridescence]], which is magic found everywhere in nature. A source which requires great understating of, or domination over the natural world. This power allows anyone to bend nature to their will, and even bend their own form to that of the natural world.\n- [[Arcana]], the unbalanced, untied, and chaotic power that saturates [[Zol]]. Arcana can be harnessed in an uncountable number of ways, but even scratching the surface of just one of these methods requires great knowledge, talent, and years of practice; however some gifted individuals can perform these acts based on their innate ability alone. Study of the Arcane can show one the great and wonderful secrets of the world, but can also drive some to madness.\n\n[[The Wills]] come from [[The Trinity]] and the rules that bind it called [[The First Tongue]]. This binding formed the very stone, sea, and sky of [[Zol]]. As well as the Magic that resides in it. By this rule, all magic in [[Zol]] must adhere to [[The Wills]] even if it hails from outside [[Zol]].\n\n[[The First Tongue]] itself is a power one can learn to control. It allows one to bend the rules of [[Zol]], as it is in its essence the rules themselves. Individuals who achieve full and uncontested mastery over a facet [[Zol]] may discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. In doing so they can perform wonderous feats of magic akin to that the [[Gods]]. This is the rarest and most difficult skill in all of [[Zol]].\n\nAs use of [[The First Tongue]] is nigh impossible, other methods of harnessing the wills are utilized by the bulk of magic wielders in Zol. These other methods are:\n- [[Vizir]], a fragment of the Trinity that exists in all beings. When harnessed it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way.\n- [[The Old Tongue]], the language that followed [[The First Tongue]]. While it is not nearly as powerful, it is much more diverse. It allows one to wield [[The Wills]] in a major way. Knowledge of this force may come with great secrets and dark truths about Zol.\n- [[Lent Power]], is power given by some wonderous source or great being other than [[The Trinity]]. When this power is bestowed upon an individual, it allows for them to channel the power of a greater being through their [[Vizir]] or learn [[The Old Tongue]] through a divine entity. This power cannot come from outside of [[The Trinity]] entirely. As all magic in [[Zol]] must be passed through it before reaching its intended target.\n\n![[Magic Diagram.png]]\n\n## Magic and Society\nThe people of [[Zol]] largely base their society and culture around some sort of magic. Safety and technology at a high level depend almost entirely on magic. This creates a strange dynamic for most of the population as only about 4% of individuals have the capacity to harness magic via gifts or training.\n\n[[Caster]]s are revered and feared because of this. The cultures and mythos of [[Zol]] are so intertwined with magic that no belief or practice is without mention of it.\n\n## Advancements in Magic\nFor almost of history, one could not access magical power unless they followed the specific known rules, or possessed an item that had undergone [[Enchantment]] via superbly powerful magic. This was all changed when the great arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] and established the trade of [[Artificers]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] is a sub section of the minor will of [[Arcana]]. It allows one to extend their [[Vizir]] into an object, or channel [[The Trinity]] itself through the object. This is done by using rudimentary runes inscribed in iron plates, allowing for a more simplistic production of magical objects. This invention revolutionized [[Zol]].\n\n## Limitations and Weaknesses of Magic\nWhile powerful, Magic is not a boundless tool. In all cases, a [[Caster]] acts as a conduit for [[The Trinity]]. Acting as this conduit requires capacity and fortitude called **Equipoise**, respective to the given task.  \n\nEquipoise is a medical term used to denote the balance of ones homeostasis, mental state, and magical capability. It is a careful balance that the body strives towards at all times. Every being has a different level of this balance. Some beings can withstand more imbalance than others.\n\nUse of any Magic, save for [[The First Tongue]], directly interferes with one's Equipoise. This can manifest as the body dropping in temperature, exhaustion, hunger, nausea, weakness, dizziness, and temporarily decreased magical ability.\n\nIt is common for novice mages to become bedridden for a few hours after their first use of magic. Skilled mages do not even notice these negative effects when using simple spells.\n\nEquipoise can be trained like a muscle over time, and seems to have no upward limit. This skill is thought to be parallel, or even interchangeable, with the strength of ones [[Vizir]]. \n\nWhen one stops using magic, the body does what it can to return to a normal Equipoisal state; however it cannot recover lost energy. This means a body can only take so much stress before it needs hours of rest paired with nutrition to regain lost Equipoise. \n\nStress can be mitigated by expanding one's Equipoisal capacity. If an individual has great skill, or some innate gift they can use magic in more efficient ways to lessen the equipoisal imbalance. The amount of magic a [[Caster]] can use before causing permanent damage to themselves is referred to as their equipoisal limit. \n\nIf one does reach their equipoisal limit, they are not cut off from magic. They are instead punished greatly by any further usage. This is called [[Magical Backfire]].\n\n## Perspectives of Magic\nMuch of what is written and taught about [[magic]] comes from Academic Arcanists. In modern times, the public understanding of [[magic]] is somewhat biased towards the academic perspective. [[Clerics]], [[druids]], occultists, [[witches]], and many more have perspectives of magic that differ greatly, and even sometimes contradict the academic perspective. \n\nMost cases of [[magic]] usage outside of academia are not recorded, tested, and debated like they are in Academic [[Arcana]]. This is because each usage is much more unique and personal. There is also much less need for it as these groups tend to begin their journey with gifts, or help from an outside source. The most obvious exception to this is [[The University]]'s [[Viridium]] and [[Observum]]; the two most organized institutions of their respective wills.\n\n## Categories of Magic\nThe usage of magic gives off a unique informational [[energy]] signature no matter the source, will used, or the [[Caster]] themselves. These signatures are called the [[Schools of Magic]] and they tell much about the nature of the magic being used.\n\n## Forces Beyond Magic\nMany believe magic to be an all encompassing force to describe [[Zol]], but there are some who believe there is other power within the world that does not come from [[Zol]] and even operate outside of [[The Trinity]]. Any academic evidence of this is purely theoretical, and is largely viewed as some portion of [[The Trinity]] that is not yet understood. Some theologians however, claim to be quite sure of these sources of power. A large example of this is that of the [[Church of The Hum]] in [[Holyfield]]\n\nThe popularized theories for other sources are:\n- [[The Hum]] - a strange force that exists in [[Holyfield]]\n- [[The Mortal Coil]] - the force of life and death itself. Many Believe it to be part of [[The Trinity]], but others disagree based on the nature of the [[Planes]] and [[Necromancy]].\n- [[The Anger of the Stars]] - a strange phenomenon observed as power that radiates from somewhere deep in [[The Cosmos]].\n- [[The Anti-Trinity]] - a mythical force associated with [[The Shroud of the Void]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Magical-Backfire":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Magical Backfire\"\n---# Magical Backfire\nMagical backfire is the result of improper usage or over-usage of [[magic]].

In the case of damage to one's [[Vizir]], it results as a [[Caster]] having their magical capacity decreased, or lost entirely.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Maps":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Maps\"\n---# Maps of Zol\n[[Zol]] has many mapped regions\n\n## Region Maps\n\n## Mapped Wilds\n\n## Cities\n\n## Seas","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Materiation":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Materiation\"\n---# Materiation\nAn affliction caused by long term usage the imperfect implementation of [[Iron Light]].

It was discovered in the early 4th millennium.\n\nIt is the process of creating an [[Apparatum]] so complex, a soul bonds to it via [[The Mortal Coil]]. Originally discovered by accident when [[Artificers]] were attempting to develop a pen that could act as a scribe for someone who was dictating to it. When the pen began writing of its own volition, a massive surge of innovation began. The pen is now known as Professor Quill and can still be found within [[The University]]'s artificary.\n\nA subservient race of beings called [[Warforged]] were developed to originally fight in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. This accelerated the conflict from both sides significantly. The destruction that could be committed by forces of soldiers that did not need sleep not sustenance was immense. The mass production of combat ready [[Warforged]] was stopped when some of them began to be damaged in specific ways that gave them free will.\n\nThese [[Warforged]] would then go on to damage other [[Warforged]], causing a chain reaction. Drastic measures had to be taken to destroy the rouge constructs, and it became known that using [[Warforged]] in large numbers was not strategically viable.\n\nSoon after slaves began to be replaced by the much more efficient mechanical counterpart. The name [[Warforged]] stuck even though they were longer just used for battle.\n\nNo one knows exactly how [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] works. The phenomenon poses an unending list of academic and philosophical questions [[Zol]] has yet to answer.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Necromancy":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Necromancy\"\n---# Necromancy\n[[Necromancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves meddling with a living or dead creatures life-force. It is considered to be the most controversial school as it possesses the power of healing wounds and disease, but can also extend ones life far beyond that of a normal mortal, or even bring the dead back to life.\n\nThis spawns massive ethical, and theological debate. The general population is made very uncomfortable by any usage of this magic that is not used for healing. All non healing magic is considered a crime in [[Laenwalde]], [[The Glassius Reach]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Ward]].\n\n## Effects of Necromancy on a User\nAny long term usage of this magic outside the realm of general healing seems to have a dark effect on ones mind and body. Physicality tends towards something monstrous in nature, and the individual's mind begins to lose the concept of empathy. It is not known why this happens. This does not seem to occur to those who revivify the dead with good intent while using the will of [[Observance]].\n\nAny individual brought fully back to life via [[Necromancy]] permanently receives the mortality rune from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] somewhere on their body. This is commonly referred to as a [[Death Scar]] Successive revivals chain together It is not known as to why this happens, but there is a lot of superstition around these individuals. This contributed to the discovery of [[Iron Light]].\n\n![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\n## Necromancy and The Mortal Coil\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is a strange force that drives all life and death in [[Zol]]. A common misconception is that [[Necromancy]] is the direct interference with [[The Mortal Coil]]. This is not the case.\n\nNecromancers utilize the laws known about [[The Mortal Coil]] and the tools [[Necromancy]] provides to cheat death by artificially conducting the actions [[The Mortal Coil]] takes naturally.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Nerousea-Station":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Nerousea Station\"\n---See [[Heliodor]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Obliteration":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Obliteration\"\n---See [[Damnation]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.932305959Z","tags":null},"/Oblivion":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Oblivion\"\n---# Oblivion\n*What remains of the Great Old One, [[Goh'zul]].

It is [[Magic]] derived from another being, or conscious source of power. It is also referred to as [[Lent Power]]. The lending of this power comes from a bond between an individual and their source. Some examples of this bond are:\n- Devout Religious Belief\n- A Pact\n- A linked bloodline\n- Personal Bond\n\nAnd many others. This bond is not so easily gained.\n\nThe bond requires some direct connection to the source. A priest may spend his whole life devoting themselves to one of the [[Gods]], but that god may not see this person as a fit for their power and influence. Contrarily a priest may have been given a gift but never have sought it out in the first place.\n\nThese bonds typically come with visions, and sometimes the ability to speak directly to the source. \n\nThe power from a bond is only as strong as the bond itself, and can become more powerful or weaken overtime. There are many records of individuals losing their bond entirely, or growing so strong that an individual embodies a large portion of their god's power for a brief moment.\n\nAs is true for all [[Magic]] in [[Zol]], power from [[Observance]] must first pass through [[The Trinity]] before reaching its user. Many who utilize the will of [[Observance]] draw from [[The Trinity]] itself as if it were a god of its own, and bear witness to some manifestation of it.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.948305786Z","tags":null},"/Ohlit":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ohlit\"\n---# Ohlit\n*Zolaen God of The Sea, Major Deity*\n![[Ohlit the great jelly.png]]\n\nOhlit, the great spirit of the sea.

In his prison, the Great Old One was forced to slowly starve and rot away. As he did, his body attracted a myriad of creatures from all across the cosmic sea. They gorged on his infinite body for eons, forming The [[Sea of Monsters]]. Each and every being who partook in the flesh of the decaying god gradually lost their physical characteristics, devolving into worm like creatures. \n\nAt the heart of the writhing sea, was the once core of the Great Old One. A heart of black stone called [[Oblivion]], and is home to The Great Old One's Soul. A Being called [[The Wretch]]. Since the defeat and imprisonment of the Great Old One, it has become the site of an everlasting duel. A fight between The Wretch, and the first being he ever consumed.\n\nWhen [[Goh'zul]] fell from power, the consumed man swore an oath to never let the creature return to its true strength. He guarded the sole door to the heart of The Great Old One, fighting tooth and nail, to prevent the escape of [[The Wretch]]. Declaring himself [[The Watcher in The Door]].\n\nAfter an age of fighting, The Watcher had reached his limit, in a final attempt at securing his victory, he wounded the immortal Wretch, so gravely it could do not but flee and hide in the dark corners of its prison. In this victory, The Watcher decided to leave [[Oblivion]], and take a new approach to his oath.\n\nHe made demands of the sea, speaking a new language called [[The First Tongue]]. His divine words struck order to the chaos. The Watcher demanded the bravest and greatest creatures, who still held onto a fragment of their past dignity must create a pact, and become his pantheon of [[Gods]].\n\nHe and his pantheon bent the sea of monsters to their will by speaking this new holy language, [[The First Tongue]]. In shaping the new world, they bound the infinite power that laid inside the Great Old One into a force called [[The Trinity]]. It would have been a paradise in its design, if not for [[The Wretch]]. \n\nFrom the confines of his prison, it whispered a dark tongue of his own. It's speech leaked from the unguarded door. The primal power clung to the words of the new gods, twisting them at their corners into dark machinations of his design.\n\nThis left the last sentient fragment of The Great Old One as a husk, but its poison would live on outside, in the newly birthed world of [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.948305786Z","tags":null},"/Planes":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Planes\"\n---# The Planes of Zol\n[[Zol]] itself is a parent realm.

Despite this, the powerful and arcane citizens of [[Zol]] have recorded a fair deal about the [[Planes]].\n\n![[Diagram of the cosmos.png]]\n\n[[Planes]] were first created from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by [[The Watcher in The Door]].

Being the source of all magical power, and the anchor for all other planes, it is the focal point for all of [[Zol]].\n\t- [[Fey]]\n\t\t- A fantastical reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where nature an beauty run rampant. While enticing, the [[Fey]] is very dangerous.\n\t- [[Fell]]\n\t\t- A dark and mysterious reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where shadows and thorns grow from a hauntingly beautiful, and extremely dangerous landscape.\n\t- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\t\t- The fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], where the elemental forces of nature stop overlapping one another. Appearing on diagrams like the drawing of a child who has colored outside of the lines. [[The Elemental Planes]] jut out of the [[Prime Material Plane]] creating worlds that solely embody a single aspect of nature. They are strange realms rarely traversed by foreigners.\n- **The Outer Planes** - Planes that are not bound by [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]\n\t\t- The Castle of [[The Watcher]] and his close allies\n\t- [[The Moons]]\n\t\t- A group of ancient planets that once existed freely in [[The Cosmos]], but were consumed by [[Goh'zul]]. Before he could fully digest them, he was defeated. Leaving a set of strange ruined worlds that orbit one another in [[Zol]]'s sky.\n\t\t- [[The Forgotten Heavens]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Moons]]. The once abandoned divine plane attached to these ancient worlds. Now inhabited by [[The Night Empress]] and her court.\n\t- [[The Palace of Drole]]\n\t\t- An endless palace inhabited by [[Yanneran]] and his chosen dead. A place of constant celebration and art.\n\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t- Where the fateless dead are sent by [[The Coilwalker]] to have their future determined.\n\t- [[Absurdia]]\n\t\t- One of the most bizarre aspects of [[Zol]]. It is described as a sort of parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Its inhabitants are very odd, and those that travel to it tell tales of strange events that almost sound like comical children's stories mixed with accounts of great violence.\n\t- [[The Unknown Realm]]\n\t\t- The home of [[The Wandering Gods]]\n\t- [[The Immortal Ocean]]\n\t\t- A realm of only water and light, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant. Accessible only to those who are not invited by its ruler [[Ohlit]].\n\t- [[The Pure Forest]]\n\t\t- A beautiful infinitely spanning forest brought into existence by [[The Lifeweaver]]'s presence, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant.\n\t- [[Elm Manor]]\n\t\t- The artificial plane constructed by [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].\n\t- [[The Storm Horizon]]\n\t\t- The origin of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s storms.\n- **Unique Planar Manifestations** - Planes, or things very similar to planes, that have their own set of rules that is unique to them.\n\t- [[The Void]]\n\t\t- The Remnants of the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The size and scope of [[The Void]] is not know by even the [[Gods]]. It exists directly underneath the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It contains evils incomprehensible to mortals, and is only held back by the efforts of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t\t- [[Damnation]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Void]]. It is an amalgamation of all hells ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], and is ruled by the terrifying demon [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is accessible in the deepest darkest caverns that span at the bottom of [[The Underdark]].\n\t- [[The Ethos]]\n\t\t- The space that surrounds all of [[Zol]]'s planes. It is essentially the lack of a plane. The whole universe exists floats amongst this manifestation of reality, [[The Ethos]] is merely the local section of it.\n\t\t- [[The Ethos]] is also bound by [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- [[The Cosmos]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Ethos]] and [[The Great Wall of Roots]].\n\t- [[The Ethereal Plane]]\n\t\t- Not truly a plane at all. Some call it The Cognitive Realm, others call it The Plane of Souls. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is the wavelength of reality that souls exist on. It overlaps all of [[Zol]]. It is possible to interface directly with [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even travel through it.\n\t- [[Oblivion]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Goh'zul]]. Little is known about [[Oblivion]]. Scripture talks of it being the battle ground between [[The Watcher]] and [[The Wretch]]. It is said to have a sole entrance called simply *The Door*, and is thought to still contain what little is left of [[Goh'zul]].\n\t- [[The Space Outside Reality]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Cosmos]]. Also known as The Far Realm.\n\n## Subplanes\nSubplanes are planes that are created within another plane. They inherit all the rules their parent plane subscribes to.\n\nExample: [[Artificers]] create the common [[Apparatum]] known as a Bag of Holding. This device is a fabric sac that contains a portal to an artificial plane that merely contains space for storing objects. If this Bag of Holding is brought to the [[Prime Material Plane]] the space inside the bag is bound to [[The Mortal Coil]], if it is brought to [[Absurdia]] it is not.\n\n## The Two Types of Planes: Planets and Realms\nA planet is a discrete, usually spherical plane that floats freely amongst [[The Cosmos]]. [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] are a good example of this. Planets typically have some central point of gravity that keeps objects on its surface. Planets do not usually have other planes bound to them in any way other than gravitational orbit of other planets.\n\nRealms are planes that are not necessarily discrete and do not have to subscribe to Euclidean Geometry. They may be infinite, repeating, fractal, or end abruptly at their edges.\n\nIn [[The Cosmos]], Parent realms are usually discerned by some sort of barrier between them and the rest of the universe. They typically contain many lesser planes bound to a [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as their own local section of [[The Cosmos]] similar to [[The Ethos]].\n\nPlanets can exist on their own or within a realm. Realms are rarely contained by a planet, but Realms usually contain other realms.\n\n## Artificial Planes\nPlanes that are not found already existing in [[Zol]] are called Artificial Planes. They are newly created, and typically temporary in the cosmic scale.\n\nThey can manifest at any size and can be produced intentionally or by wild magic. The can exist as planets or realms.\n\nConstructing a plane intentionally is very difficult and requires immense skill. The size, specifications, and permanency of the plane depends on the ability of the creator.\n\nA good example of this is the plane of [[Elm Manor]], home to [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].

Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the city is built from striking red brick and mortar. There are dozens of different manufactures for all things train within Rails. Metal forgers, [[Iron Light]] [[Artificers]], lumber craftsmen, textile workers, glass makers, and merchants are a dime a dozen in Rails. This makes for cut throat competition.\n\n![[rails.png]]\n\nWhat would appear as a quaint, busybody town to an outsider, is known as a devious and plotting economy to the locals. Underselling, and outsourcing, and insider trading are what  fills the day in Rails. While deception, sabotage, and even assassination plagues its nights.\n\n![[rails 2.png]]\n\nRails is also one of the few cities that have the Great Tracks running directly through the cities center.\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | An extremely industrial city with a the utmost appreciation for craftsmanship. Its economy, made up from guilds of merchants and laborers, thrives due to [[Zol]]'s dependence upon [[The Great Tracks]]. Nearly all production and maintenance of [[Trains]] in [[Zol]] occurs in [[Rails]]. |\n| Main Challenge | The city's fast moving businesses are in constant competition with each other. Over the years this has spawned cutthroat competition between mobs that secretly run most of the city's commerce behind the scenes. Additionally, the constant coming and going of trains from all over [[Zol]] makes this city a smugglers paradise. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Multicultural, Imported goods |\n| Export | Labor, [[Trains]]  |\n| Size | Medium |\n| City Leader | Grand Artificer Janeesa Query |\n| Primary Language(s) | None |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Central, Busy, Industrial, Good Economy, City Trams |\n| Architecture | Red clay brick buildings interwoven with complex pipeworks |\n| Color(s) | Violet and Yellow |\n| Symbolism | A circular train track |\n| Defenses | City garrison, War-trains, Dual action turrets |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Workers | Social class | The common folk of the city. Metal workers, low-level artificers, warehouse workers, and things of the like. Few people in the city are of extreme poverty due to the highly available work.|\n| Grand Artificers | Social class | The overseers of train related work within the city. These artificers, accredited by the academic institutions of [[Zol]], are hired by guilds to lead workers in their day to day escapades. These individuals are considered of the highest social class. |\n| Rail Merchants | Social class | Individuals who manage the business side of the rail trade. Writing invoices for repair, purchasing and selling raw material, and selling rail cars. These individuals belong to the middle and high class depending on their success. |\n| The Iron Union | Workers Guild | The largest workers guild. Largely known to be backed by The Iron Mob. Known to be by the people and for the people. |\n| The Artificers Guild | Workers Guild | A guild under the support of [[Kerketh Academy]]. Members must be accredited by one of [[Zol]]'s academic institutions. |\n| The Merchants Guild | Workers Guild | A guild made up by nearly a quarter of the city's merchants. Largely known to be backed by the Dragonkin Mob. |\n| The Rail-works Guild | Workers Guild | A guild made up of common workers, skilled artificers, and merchants. It runs an educational institution for the purpose of training those who wish to enter the rail trade. While smaller in size this guild is quite influential as all conductors of [[The Great Tracks]] are members to it. Known to be backed by the Volden Mob. |\n| The Iron Mob | Criminal | Headed by Paros Dalth, a mean, no nonsense human man. This mob frequently employs members of the guild it backs, The Iron Union. This gives them the largest number of goons out of all the major mobs. |\n| The Dragonkin Mob | Criminal | Headed by Astos Belkan, a proud and well dressed dragonborn man. This mob is the richest of its peers due to its backing of The Merchants Guild, giving them the highest quality of resources. |\n| The Volden Mob | Criminal | Headed by Vellen Volden, a seemingly scatterbrained and silly artificer who is swift and brutal when it comes to running her mob. This mob has the most loyal and almost cult-like following as many members of its backed institution, The Rail-workers Academy are recruited into the mob during their education. |\n| Small-time Mobs | Criminal | Around 2 dozen mobs of varying sizes that frequently rise and fall similar to a feudal system. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Brick Keep | Keep | They city's keep |\n | Rails Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle |\n | Rails Station | Train Station | The city's train station. Uniquely located within the city's walls |\n | The Foundry | Guild | Headquarters to The Artificers Guild. Owned by Kerketh Academy. Located between Trackmaker Lot and the Upper Ward. |\n | The House of Iron | Guild | Headquarters to The Iron Union. Located in Trackmaker Lot. |\n | The Rail-workers Academy | Guild | Headquarters to The Rail-workers Guild. Located in the northmost end of Trackmaker Lot. |\n | The Coin Coupling | Guild/Wine House | Upscale Winehouse and central meeting place for The Merchants Guild. |\n | Trackmaker Square | Market | The city's hub of train related trade. |\n | The Honeysquare Markets | Market | Markets interspersed all throughout the Honeysquare district. Home to trade not directly involving [[Trains]]. |\n | Meadwalk | Market | The Tavern District, and neutral ground between mobs where fighting is not allowed. |\n | The Iron Spike | Tavern | A large tavern associated with The Iron Union. |\n | Staggers | Tavern | A small tavern associated with the Artificers guild. |\n | The Hardened Tooth | Tavern | A medium sized tavern associated with the Dragonkin Mob. |\n | The Needed Rest | Tavern | A large tavern associated with the Rail-workers guild |\n | Rick's Magical Imports | Magic Shop | A magical emporium run by the mild-mannered Rick Latia, a middle aged, dark skinned, human man. |\n | The Tramway | Misc. | A system of small train like cars that move citizens all about the city free of charge. |\n | The Yard | Misc. | Located in central Trackmaker Lot, The Yard is the hub of train manufacturing and repair. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by the [[Alderian Seat]] Grand Artificer Janeesa Query. She, her nobility, and her garrison keep a general appearance of order to the city, despite the heavy mob presence. This is because the mobs themselves hold each other at knifepoint. \n\nSoon after the origin of [[The Great Tracks]], crime surged in the city. This continued for a few decades of chaos as profitability of [[The Great Tracks]] grew. Eventually it reached a point where some criminal organizations that backed legitimate trade were able to become wealthy. Enough so that they were able to dig in with a sense of permanency and order.\n\nWhen this occurred bloodshed between mobs and the garrison changed from frequent, chaotic and brutal, to well-planned, swift, and impactful events. Mobs have to tread carefully as to not being wars between them. This makes Rails a strangely ordered city, despite the massive criminal network.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Rails]] is [[Zol]]'s eastern hub of all things related to [[The Great Tracks]]. This is because the original development of the tracks began within this city. It became a hub of skill, and commerce for the trade. Other city's attempted to begin their own versions of this trade, but nearly all merchants and craftsmen all flocked to [[Rails]] as it was much more profitable. The only other comparable city is the western city of [[Ryze]] in [[Laenwalde]].\n\nThis pattern over time has developed a methodology for [[Trains]]. All planned routes of trains over time are planned to pass through [[Rails]] and [[Ryze]]. When they arrive maintenance and improvements are done before they are sent on another planned route. Because of this, if a train car has an issue far from one of the cities, it is usually abandoned.\n\nSince most land based shipping occurs via train, [[Rails]] is also a hub for criminal smuggling.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThey city's name *Rails* was originally pronounced *Ra-ee-liss*, but after the creation of [[The Great Tracks]], foreigners mispronounced the name due to the rails which [[Trains]] move upon. The misattributed name sake stuck.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Ralatas-Prince-of-Beasts":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Ralatas, Prince of Beasts\"\n---# Ralatas, Prince of Beasts\n*Wayward God of Beasts and the Hunt, Major Deity*\n![[Ralatas prince of beasts.png]]\n\nLord of the forest, god of claw and fang, master of the hunt.

Ralatas is known to spend much of his time in a rock formation and series of caves that resembles a castle some-what. \n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of Ralatas are usually mystics, druids, tribes, and other social oddities. Formal worship is not practiced. Relations with Ralatas manifest more as a way of life involving hunts, and spending most of ones time in the natural world.\n\n## State of Princedom\nRalatas succeeded his father [[Kerndall]] when the once king attempted to expand his domain by converting society to beasts. He did so by manufacturing a disease called [[Beast Ire]]. A condition that caused madness and mutations. Converting mortals into feral beasts who hunted their own kin. Devouring hundreds and spreading the disease to others.\n\nThe disease eventually mutated in such a way where it could infect beasts as well. Causing them to take on horrifying forms. [[Kerndall]] was forced to contain the ailment within himself to save [[Zol]]. Maddening him and turning him into a horrible monster now under the control of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\nRalatas will not take the title of king until his father has been slain.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Rali-Trunsarr":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Rali Trunsarr\"\n---See [[The Page of Cups]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Reduced-Magic":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Reduced Magic\"\n---# Reduced Magic\nAn informational [[energy]] signature given off by very basic magic.

The presence of the [[Gods]] is very well known, but their methods, intentions, and origins are largely a mystery.\n\nReligion in Zol takes many forms. Some undergo their practice as an individual journey, or participate in one of the many [[Religious Organizations]]. There many churches, sects, cults, traditions, and practices. All with their own unique belief systems to make sense of the complex world of [[Zol]] and its mysterious [[Gods]].\n\n## Major Beliefs\nThere is a vast number of perspectives from which [[Zol]] and its [[Gods]] are understood. Most of which can be summarized by these 6 categories. Ordered from most common to least common:\n\n- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 40% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[Zolaen Gods]] created [[Zol]] and are the true and holy rulers of it. This belief system also subscribes to the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are malicious, or at the very least not to be trusted. This is because Zolaen-Centric belief blames [[The Undoing]] on the [[Zolaen Gods]]. It also entails that the [[Wayward Gods]] are dangerous and not to be trusted due to their chaotic nature.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship one or many of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Regardless of their specific method of worship, it is generally thought that one should pay respect and worship to all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] from time-to-time.\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with, or rather an extension of, the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t- Shares harmony with Trinity-Centric Beliefs\n\n- ### Trinity-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 30% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based in the general idea that the pantheons of [[Gods]] are not the true ultimate power. They instead believe that [[The Trinity]] itself is the only thing deserving of worship. In this system, the [[Gods]] are either mere extensions of [[The Trinity]], or false gods who stray the light of [[The Trinity]]. This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Anti-Trinity]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship [[The Trinity]] as a whole or some specific manifestation of it. Like the [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[The Trinity]].\n\t- Shares harmony with Zolaen-Centric Beliefs\n\n- ### Polytheism\n\t- *Roughly 10% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system recognizes each god as an individual being, and does not judge them based on their pantheon. Followers of this belief typically focus on a single god, or small group of gods based on the individuals selection. This system typically operates under the assumption that [[The Undoing]] was caused by the [[Gods]], but it is not know which gods. So judgement is not cast.\n\n- ### Wanderer-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 8% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are more of guardians rather than [[Gods]]. They are thought to have come to [[Zol]] to protect civilization from the unchecked power of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. As per this belief system, [[The Undoing]] is seen as the fault of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Those who subscribe to this theory also believe that the [[Wayward Gods]] and [[Wordbearers]] are not all inertly bad.\n\t- Followers of this belief see [[The Wandering Gods]] more as mentors rather than omnipotent rulers, guiding them in their struggles.\n\t- With only a fifth of the following compared to Trinity Centric or Zolaen Centric\n\n- ### Atheism\n\t- *Roughly 5% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system operates based on the assumption that mortals need not revere [[Gods]], as they are merely beings. Their power does not make them holy, only more present in [[Zol]]. The specific ideas differ from person to person, but largely revolves around skepticism towards information about the gods divined through worship.\n\n- ### Worship Obscura\n\t- *Roughly 5% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system operates consolidates all beliefs that do not subscribe to any other system. This may be the worship of some obscure force that is not understood by [[Zol]] or something of the like. Examples of this are:\n\t\t- The [[Church of The Hum]]\n\t\t- [[The Oldshards]]\n\n- ### Void Worship\n\t- *Roughly 2% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea of sacrifice in exchange for power from the [[Void Gods]]. A taboo practice in all of society, this belief is a dangerous and dark practice. Individuals who practice this faith are known for having twisted world views.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Religious-Organizations":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Religious Organizations\"\n---# Religious Organizations\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] is a complex thing.

These parts do not get along very well.\n\n![[riverbridge.png]]\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city's is the most centrally located place in all of [[Zol]], it has little pieces of all of the world's culture all tied within it, and does not have the same feeling of oppressive crown rule as mainland [[Kapesh]]. Many sailors from all over [[The Narrow Sea]] and [[The Archsea]] frequent this city. |\n| Main Challenge | The city has changed hands between [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] many of times. Due to this, the city is full of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. The vast majority of these people do not like each other. Eastern [[Riverbridge]] being the territory of the [[Humans]], and the west going to the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Fish, Imported Foods, Farmed Goods, Rum |\n| Export | Fish, Ships |\n| Size | Large |\n| City Leader | Lady Trell Gallan  |\n| Primary Language(s) | Human, Elvish, and Dwarvish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Humans, Elves, and Dwarves |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Trinity-Centric, Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Island City, Great Bridges, Costal |\n| Architecture | Cycladic, Arches |\n| Color(s) | Black and Gold |\n| Symbolism | A vertical sword with a bridge spanning from either side |\n| Defenses | Naval Fleet, City Garrison |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | Those charged by the crown with running the city, or successful business owners. |\n| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work. Be it because of health issues, mental state, addiction, or some other personal reason. These individuals are extremely poor and are occasional persecuted for their begging and made to be slaves. |\n| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |\n| Human Population | Racial group | The Humans of the city, the politically extreme are very anti elf and dwarf and believe they should be removed from the city. |\n| Elven Population | Racial Group | The Elves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with dwarves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |\n| Dwarven Population | Racial Group | The dwarves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with elves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |\n| Off-Human Population | Racial Group | The 'bystanders' of the city's racial conflicts. Once, Off-Human individuals were horribly mistreated by [[The Triumvirate]], but within [[Riverbridge]] they are strangely the neutral party and are able to freely mingle with any group. The most racist members of the other groups are known to say \"at least you're not one of them\" to the off humans. As one would expect, most off humans hate [[The Triumvirate]] and their stupid squabble within the city. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Driftwood Keep | Keep | The city's keep |\n | Riverbridge Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's teleportation circle |\n | Riverbridge Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Burnmarkets | Market | The city's main market which is begrudgingly shared by all local groups by order of the city's Lady. |\n | Dockmarkets | Market | The market closest to the dock.

Lady Gallan is known for being a good ruler but faces many challenges with [[The Triumvirate]] population and its bickering.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day the city is a hub of trade between the eastern and western kingdoms of [[Zol]]. It is also the bottleneck for the [[The Great Tracks]] as the bridges that span [[The Narrow Sea]] run through it.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Riverbridge]] was constantly fought over during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. It changed hands between both [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] many times. Both the city and sections of the great bridges had to be frequently rebuilt.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of the city could likely immigrate back to [[Gethsemane]] if they wished, given they could afford it. However most do not as their families have been living in the city for quite some time, and feel a sort of ownership of it. Leaving would be giving that up.\n- The Great Bridges of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Kierketholl]]'s Megastructures.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Saen":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Saen\"\n---See [[Laenwalde]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Sapient-Beings":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Sapient Beings\"\n---# The World of Sapient Beings\nSapience is defined as possessing wisdom, judgement, and intellect.

These three concepts are all one and the same, merely in different states. These states can be bound and influenced, or shifted to another state using [[Sympathetic bonds]].\n- Academic Arcanists understand [[Zol]] an **infinite four dimensional grid of nodes**. Each one of these nodes are fragment [[The Trinity]], and exist in one of the three states: Space, Matter and Energy.\n\t- If you were to pick two points in space, each of these points could be represented as one node. In-between these two points there are an infinite number of other nodes.\n\t- One does not consider how they are acting on these states directly, this is merely a product of the used [[magic]]. Acting on nodes differs greatly given the state that the node is in:\n\t\t- **Acting on space** can modify gravity, teleport objects, and open portals.\n\t\t- **Acting on matter** can change the form, strength and mass of something.\n\t\t- **Acting on energy** is the most complex, useful, and frequently used task of an arcanist. Energy can be applied, removed, transferred, and observed. The types of energy are\n\t\t\t- Kinetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that moves things. It is produced in a number of different ways, but largely is based around the motion of matter. Can be transferred quite easily with [[Sympathetic bonds]]. It used to both apply forces, and create/mask sound.\n\t\t\t- Heat\n\t\t\t\t- Different, but intersectional with the Elemental energy of fire. Heat energy is the energy created reactions, be it magical, biological, or alchemical. Heat energy can be channeled in and out of systems in large quantities with only a single bond.\n\t\t\t- Light\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that is produced by most alchemical reactions, and the presence of [[magic]]. It can both illuminate and darken. Used to create illusions, make things invisible, illuminate rooms,  and mask things in darkness.\n\t\t\t- Gravitational\n\t\t\t\t- The force of attraction between objects, and [[Zol]] itself. This is ever-present, but objects can be cut of from it partially, or entirely by skilled arcanists. This energy can be synthesized, manipulated, or nullified for interesting results.\n\t\t\t- Magnetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that gathers around, and interacts with metal. This is theorized to be responsible for the opportunity of [[Iron Light]].\n\t\t\t- Raw\n\t\t\t\t- [[Zol]] was essentially made from an endless well of power. When it was bound by [[The First Tongue]], much of it was turned into the world is understood to be. What wasn't changed is still present. This is Raw Energy, and it can still be harnessed. This is the most abundant form of energy.\n\t\t\t- Elemental\n\t\t\t\t- Within [[Zol]], there are certain substances or reactions that give off a unique energy which can be harnessed by arcanists. These elemental forces are:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: burning oil\n\t\t\t\t\t- Frost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: a blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t- Lightning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: static generated by rubbing wool against itself\n\t\t\t\t\t- Necrosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: rotting fruit\n\t\t\t\t\t- Radiance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: refined gold\n\t\t\t\t\t- Poison\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: death-cap mushrooms\n\t\t\t\t\t- Acid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: citrus\n\t\t\t- Cognitive\n\t\t\t\t- All minds emit and accept cognitive energy. This energy is extremely complex and difficult to understand or interfere with. A skilled arcanist can use this to communicate, create illusions, hurt, and even read minds.\n\t\t\t\t- Some academics believe this to be a subsection of Informational Energy.\n\t\t\t- Informational\n\t\t\t\t- All things emit a unique wavelength of energy based on the nature of their existence in [[Zol]] as a product of [[The First Tongue]]. This wavelength can be observed and translated into usable information in many different ways. \n\t\t- **Shifting states**\n\t\t\t- Changing a node's state to another varies in difficulty, but can be the most useful trick for an arcanist if done correctly. This practice is far out of reach for a beginner [[caster]], but is thought to be what makes an individual into a true arcanist.\n\t\t\t- Space can be turned to massive amounts of energy, the light of a candle can be used to form a suit of armor made from ice, an arrow flying for ones throat can be turned into harmless wind.\n\t\t\t- Nodes changed eventually return to [[The Ethos]] to  revert back to their original state decided upon by [[The First Tongue]].

It operations on the principal of Likeness.\n-  A simple example of the usage of [[sympathy]] would be a [[caster]] with 2 copper coins on a table. The coins are in no way magical, but if the [[caster]] convinces a part of their brain beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are the exact same coin, they become sympathetically bonded. The [[caster]] can now convince an separate part of their brain in the same way that if one coin moves, the other will move as well. These 2 parts of the brain need to be entirely separated, almost as if they were separate minds on their own. This is called [[Splitting]]. When done successfully, any force applied to one coin affects both coins.\n\t- If you were to lift this coin, you would feel that it weighs a little more than double its normal weight. This is because overall the coins are about 98% alike. They are the same material, shape, and carry the same significance. This is the principal of Likeness. In actuality, the coin would weigh slightly more than double, as [[Sympathetic bonds]] are imperfect.\n\t- One could also split their mind to bond them thermally. Tossing one coin in the fire would cause the other to glow red with heat sympathetically.\n\t\t- Other more complicated bonds could be formed. For instance, a feather of a raven could be used to hunt a partridge by snapping the birds neck. This is however extremely inefficient as they are only about 20% alike at best, and would require a great deal of [[Splitting]] and [[energy]].\n\t\t- Academic [[Arcana]] is based on finding very efficient, practical, and replicable bonds to create a [[Spell]].\n\t- The usage of these bonds in an ad hoc manner is sometimes referred to as prestidigitation.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Tarot-Ring-Bearers":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Tarot Ring Bearers\"\n---Those who posses one or many of [[The Rings of Tarot]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.952305742Z","tags":null},"/Tellab-the-Wise":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Tellab, the Wise\"\n---# Tellab, The Wise\n*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*\n![[Telab The Wise.png]]\n\nHe who understands all and seeks for others to wield the same.

Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the sake of its nickname comes from the topography which the city rests upon. A set of wide rifts which house a unique geological phenomenon called [[Rift Iron]], a valuable metal that regrows slowly after being mined. It is used to make objects that can reform after breaking.\n\n![[tenzentak.png]]\n\nThis natural resource gives Tenzentak a stable economy, and hopeful future. Unfortunately, it also produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has developed powerful [[Iron Light]] air filters that utilize light from [[The Sun]] to clean the air. This ensures the city above the rifts remains clean and beautiful, but leaves those who live in the rifts to suffer.\n\nAt the cities eastern edge lies [[The Grand Nothing]], and [[Gilligan's Lift]] which is controlled by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Built on the edge of [[The Grand Nothing]], the city is full of people who seek to explore its wonder and seek out the mysteries of [[Zol]]'s past.

Many Lowborn suffer from afflictions caused by [[Rift Smog]] |\n| [[The Bladehammer Guild]] | Guild | A massive guild that controls [[Gilligan's Lift]]. The Guild operates all over eastern [[Zol]]. It is made up of many subgroups, all with unique goals that support overarching dream of the whole guild: 'Create a better [[Zol]]' |\n| The Unhealed Dagger | Criminal | The overarching term for the diverse criminal nexus that operates in the depth of the city's rifts.

A fast-paced and seedy bazaar packed into tight quarters. |\n | Albojo's Wares | Magic Shop | The sole magic shop in the city. A high class establishment located in the Rift-Top Square. Run by the snooty Tabaxi Albojo Albojo II. |\n | The View | Tavern | A large and popular tavern for the middle class located on the cliff's edge in Smogtown. Run by a soft-spoken Dwarf man called Kalb Rike. |\n | Immarum | Tavern | A high class drinking and dining establishment for the nobility. Located in the Rift-Top Square. |\n | The Pit | Tavern | Located in the depths of the central Rift, The Pit is has a reputation of being a strange bar filled with shady patrons.

Run by a one eyed Ogre called 'Runt'. |\n | The Sheathe-Anvil Tavern | Tavern | [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s private tavern, reserved for guild members. Located within the guild campus. |\n | [[The Bladehammer Guild]] | Guild | The largest operating guild in all of [[Zol]], headquartered in [[Tenzentak]].

Its operation is overseen by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].|\n\n## Authority\nThe city is led by Lady Helseena Trodak, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Tenzentak]]. Her rule (in her own words) is one of 'balance'. [[Tenzentak]] faces unique challenges being the hub of outreach into [[The Grand Nothing]]. \n\nLady Trodak seeks to maintain the economy to support the efforts of those who venture out into [[The Grand Nothing]]. In doing so she requires the export of [[Rift Iron]]. Unfortunately the mining and refinement of the material is the source of many of the city's issues. \n\n[[The Bladehammer Guild]] provides the Tenzentak Garrison, one of the guilds many subgroups, in exchange for much of its funding and tax exemption. This garrison acts as the city's guard, or army in times of war.\n\nThe authority of Lady Trodak wavers the deeper in the rift you go. The lowborn people mostly live by their own rules and codes, only occasionally being harassed by the garrison.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn its current day an age, the city is the most accessible means for one to venture into [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many travel here to seek out the treasures hidden in the ruins of the old world.\n\nIt is also home to the headquarters of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. The guild is the largest operating party of mercenaries, scholars, craftsmen, and politicians. The guild is made up of many subgroups that have legitimacy all over [[Zol]]. Those who take up arms with the guild are given the agency to do much in the kingdoms of The Three Corners of Civilization.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Tenzentak]] was one of the first cities to be founded in [[Zol]]. Its location on the cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]] was instrumental in [[The Dragon War]]. This was due to the strong up drafting winds that rise from the cliff. These gusts made for difficult sustained airborne combat for dragons.\n\nIts defensible location also caused it to be the last of the Human cities to fall in the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Rebels were able to finally take the city by sending squads of soldiers to climb laterally along the cliffs edge and sabotage the cities defenses during the night.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The natural regrowth of [[Rift Iron]] creates toxic off-gassing called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has created filters powered by sunlight that cleanse the air for the upper city. However those who live in the rifts have to wear face coverings and often have health complications.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.960305655Z","tags":null},"/The-Alktree-Haven":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Alktree Haven\"\n---# The Alktree Haven\nOne of [[Zol]]'s  [[Religious Organizations]]. [[The Alktree Haven]], is located on the southeast border of [[The Witchlands]] near [[Viscera]]. It is meant as a place for anyone of any belief to congregate. Within the safe-haven individuals can enjoy open-minded discussion, art, philosophical debate, sermons, and lectures.\n\n## Values (Neutral Good)\n*\"A place where any person, of any creed, can come to eat, drink, and think freely\"*\n\nAbove all else [[The Alktree Haven]] values peace, and the celebration of individuality. Its reputation is known all across [[Zol]] despite its small size. It is known as a place where anyone can seek refuge, knowledge and companions. So long as you bring good intentions to the tree, you will be met with open arms. \n\n## Origin\nThe haven began as a place of refuge during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Many who did not want to fight fled into the dangerous [[The Witchlands]]. So many of these people, driven from their homes, were lost to the dangers of the wilds. However, a small few discovered the haven guarded by a [[magic]] tree that warded off monsters.\n\nIt became a home for many, shared experiences amongst its residents drove them to aid anyone who needed it. Slowly but surely it grew in size and reputation. Its was given the name of a lost friend who had died protecting its grounds from bandits.\n\n## Structure\nThe haven has few rules and a very loose hierarchy.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- Two individuals act as the head of the organization. [[Hal Draen]] a soft spoken, old and powerful druid, and the eccentric [[Poldan Rike]] a gifted sorcerer. These two are well respected by many-a-traveler.\n- ### Size\n\t- The haven itself does not have any formal membership, but at any given time there are typically a few hundred people on its grounds at any given time. There are however a few thousand who have considered it a home at some point in their life.\n- ### Rules\n\t- All violence (verbal or physical), discriminatory behavior, and nationalism is banned within the grounds of [[The Alktree Haven]]. Violation of these rules results in banishment from the grounds, further infraction results in execution. This violence is only allowed when done in defense of the Alktree.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- A white mangrove tree on blue backing\n\n## Assets\n- The Alktree itself is a colossal mangrove tree with a hollow interior. The void within the tree has been filled with a large structure that is used by those who reside in the haven. The grounds around the tree contain a small village, all of which is considered the domain of the haven.\n- The haven has no formal defenses, but the tree itself magically wards off monsters\n- In times of bloodshed, any members capable of fighting would lay down their life to protect the haven.\n- Everything within the haven is given freely. Food, shelter, medicine, knowledge, and tools.\n\n## Relationships\n- The nearby nations respect the sanctity of [[The Alktree Haven]], but in past times there have been instances of bounty hunters causing a stir in search of their mark.\n- Many powerful witches of [[The Witchlands]] have sworn to protect it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.960305655Z","tags":null},"/The-Apex":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Apex\"\n---See [[The Oldshards]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.960305655Z","tags":null},"/The-Archsea":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Archsea\"\n---# The Archsea\n![[The Archsea.jpg]]\n\ndescription\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **[[Abdjadan]]**\n- **[[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]]**\n- **Isle of Szest**\n- **Isle of Jaxies**\n- **Old Hezera**\n- **The Smatterings**\n\n## Climate\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n\n## Inhabitants\n\n## Borders","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.960305655Z","tags":null},"/The-Astral-Sea":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Astral Sea\"\n---See [[The Ethos]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.960305655Z","tags":null},"/The-Awakening":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Awakening\"\n---# The Awakening\nA term used for the recorded explanations by the earliest people who were transported to the Three Corners of Civilization and had their memories taken during [[The Undoing]].\n\nThere are no recorded first hand accounts from [[The Awakening]].

The landscape that was home to the ancient people of [[Zol]] was struck with a force so destructive it demolished nearly everything, reducing it to dust and ruins. What was left was a seemingly endless wasteland.\n\nParts of ruined towns and other elements of civilization have been discovered. Murals, magical relics, scraps of paper, bones, tapestries, pottery, metal and glassworks, and ruined machines tell of an ancient people far more advanced than modern people.\n\nIt is thought this civilization had a comprehensive understanding of [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]], and they lived centuries long lifespans. Only evidence of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] in the old world have been uncovered. \n\nDue to this evidence, paired with the fact that [[Humans]] are much shorter lived than [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]], many theories about [[Old Zol]] were created.

This language is what binds [[The Trinity]] into all of existence within Zol. It is referred to as a language for lack of a better term. Unlike modern language, The First Tongue must be spoken with more than just words and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The First Tongue must be spoken with uncontested knowledge, unbound emotion, iron will, perfect artistry, exact movement, unwavering faith, and a [[Vizir]] like no other. The words of The First Tongue are so complex they cannot be recorded in any useful manner of writing.\n\nThe First Tongue is thought to be a collection of names an rules for all things in [[Zol]]. As a result it is a broad language, but is theorized to have limits in this way. It is generally accepted that the only being to know the full span of The First Tongue is [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Despite the omnipotence this would give a being, his scripture claims he does not utilize this power as it would be unjust. This sparks debate among scholars and theologians.\n\n## Relation to The Old Tongue\nThe First Tongue is the predecessor of [[The Old Tongue]], and is much more powerful. An individual who knows a word from The First Tongue has full dominion over that element of [[Zol]]. This grants [[Magic]] power akin to that of a god. Acquiring a word from The First Tongue is arguably the single most difficult thing one can achieve as an individual in [[Zol]].\n\n## Discovery and Possession\nLittle is known about how to actually acquire a word from The First Tongue, and those who do know keep it a well guarded secret. It is thought that before [[The Undoing]], there were many who possessed words. In modern times, there are only 5 publicly known individuals who possess a word. They go by the title of [[Wordbearers]]. Rumors and legends tell of many more than 5, but that remains to be proven.\n\nDiscovering a word in The First Tongue is said to feel like witnessing the whole universe itself for a single moment. A second spans into an eternity and the truths held behind the word you have discovered come as no surprise to you, as you are its champion. It instead come as a comfort, a tool for you to shape [[Zol]] like no other.\n\nOne the major differences The First Tongue has over [[The Old Tongue]] is words from The First Tongue can be passed down to a worthy apprentice. This requires that the apprentice has studied for a lifetime under the [[Wordbearers]], and has a mastery over the subject beaten only by their master Word Bearer. This allows for individuals to complete a challenge far less great than discovering a word on their own. The word is passed upon death given the Wordbearer wills it so, and the candidate is worthy.\n\nThis has allowed some words to stay amongst the population for many generations, and has defined history in many ways. The words publicly known and available in the modern world are:\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- [[The Word of Shadow]]\n- [[The Word of Iron]]\n- [[The Word of Wrath]]\n- [[The Word of Growth]]\n- [[The Word of Storms]]\n\nThere has never been a record of an individual possessing more than one word, nor 2 individuals possessing the same word. It is suspected this is a principal of The First Tongue, but it also may just be a product of its rarity.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.972305525Z","tags":null},"/The-Forgotten-Heavens":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Forgotten Heavens\"\n---# The Forgotten Heavens\n*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nHome to [[The Night Empress]], [[The Forgotten Heavens]] is a landscape of old overgrown ruins and a sky full of shooting stars.\n\n![[The Forgotten Heavens.png]]\n\nIt is thought that spending prolonged time in [[The Forgotten Heavens]] will eventually reveal hidden truths about ones past.\n\nThe realm is largely vacant, but from time to time the unclaimed souls of children can be seen playing in the gardens and streams.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.972305525Z","tags":null},"/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Free Cities of Alderun\"\n---# The Free Cities of Alderun\n![[The Free Cities of Alderun.jpg]]\n\nOnce known as South Kapesh, Alderun has a history of oppression and rebellion. Despite its difficult past, Alderun now flourishes with life and culture. A land where anyone can choose to be who they want, but with great freedom comes discourse.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Tenzentak]] - The Rift City, built on the very edge of the world\n- [[Rails]] - The City of Trains\n- [[Holocene]] - The City of Art and Beauty\n- [[Deepspell]] - The City of Magic and Innovation\n- [[Zessgorn]] - The City of Cups\n- [[Hanen]] - The Quaint City of Heroes\n- [[Ka'thoor]] - The Border City of Orcs\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nDiverse like no other region of its size, The Alderian wilds contains a menagerie of animals, plants, and monsters that differ wildly as one travels from [[Zessgorn]] to [[Holocene]].\n\nThe regions diversity gives much opportunity to its people, but its monsters cause for many problems. The Cities of Alderun spend much of their resources focusing on inner workings of their urban centers. This leaves the wilds an untamed and lawless place.\n\nCriminals and monsters roam the remote places of Alderun. While not as dangerous as its western neighbor, [[Kapesh]]. One would not want to be caught off the safe path in these wilds.\n\nGeographical features vary from gorgeous coast lines, rolling hills, spanning rivers, large lakes, and the ever strange cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]].\n\nIts climates vary from the tropical coasts near [[Zessgorn]] to the frigid stretch of the Dyed Forest.\n\n## History\nDuring the [[First Age]], [[Human Sovereigntists]] claimed that the Off-Humans must live a life of servitude under the Human population. The [[Humans]] of Kapesh enforced themselves as 'higher beings' over the [[Off-Human]] races. The oppressed people were forced to undergo oppressions, slavery, and in some cases even dark experiments. These tests were intended to discover a way to restore the [[Great Magic]] of the humans by recombining the Off-Humans with their once hosts. The humans were understandably met with resistance.\n\nRebellions against the humans rose and fell. The true overturning of South Kapesh was not until [[Eirmond the Brave]] rose to glory. Eirmond was a stellar fighter, and a great leader to the Off-Human People.  A [[Half-Orc]] man, born in [[Ka'thoor]]. He won Alderun, city-by-city, a civil war that is now known as the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe Kingdom's population consists mostly of [[Off-Human]]s and [[Humans]], but does contain many members from all the [[Races]] of [[Zol]]. Each city has its own unique culture and peoples.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe kingdom is governed by the [[Alderian Council]]. A senate of representatives from each of the cities who work as a unit to make decisions, and delegate resources across the cities.\n\nThe high degree of freedom given by the [[Alderian Laws]] has allowed for a thriving economy where any enterprise can succeed given it has merit. However this freedom does also bring discourse and chaos.\n\nGoverning people with a high degree of freedom is quite difficult. This means cut throat competition between businesses, crime, and those unlucky few who fall through the cracks of a well intentioned system. \n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt and culture is very abundant in The Free Cities. This is due to the fact each city upholds a unique culture, and every individual is allowed to worship any benevolent god they choose.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nWithin the Free Cities, academics are associated with [[Kerketh Academy]]. An institution open to anyone who can prove themselves under examination, and pay the high tuition costs. \n\nThere is also a fair degree of education and apprenticeship that occurs at [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. As well as the occasional private tutelage is conducted here and there.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe Free Cities are on good terms with almost all kingdoms of The Three Corners save for their neighbor [[Kapesh]]. The relationship with [[Kapesh]] is difficult due to their history, but in modern times it has resolved to reluctant amicability.\n\nWithin the Kingdom, the various cities have complicated relationships. The court of The Free Cities constantly changes friendships and rivalries, however there are a few constants amongst the chaos. [[Zessgorn]] is a notably difficult city to organize as its crime has gotten far out of hand, and [[Holocene]] does not play nicely with the overall mission of The Free Cities as their nobility is known for exploiting the less fortunate.\n\n## Military\nThe Kingdoms military is comprised of the cities' garrisons. It may not be the most grand of militaries, but it is well supplemented by [[The Bladehammer Guild]] and [[Kerketh Academy]]. It also has a sizeable navy within [[Zessgorn]]. The Kingdom would not be a great threat if it were to attack, but it is well placed for defense due to its mountains.\n\n## Borders\nThe Free Cities border the kingdoms of: \n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n\nAs well as the wilds of:\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[The Grand Nothing]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.980305438Z","tags":null},"/The-Glassius-Reach":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Glassius Reach\"\n---# The Glassius Reach\n![[The Glassius Reach.jpg]]\n\nGeographically and politically isolated, The Reach is cut off from the rest of the world by [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]] and the treacherous [[Wrath Wastes]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] is the most alien of the kingdoms within The Three Corners. Both its wilderness, and its people are unlike any other. Inhabited by [[Changelings]], and scorned by all of [[Zol]], the Reach holds many mysteries.\n\nThe most notable mystery being [[The Oldshards]]. Two strange relics which the culture and society of [[Changelings]] is based around.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Yorn et Gaul]] - The Broken City\n- [[Corinth]] - The Bastion of Tradition\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nThe Reach is as dangerous as it is awe inspiring. It is alien to the rest of [[Zol]]. Strange radially symmetric plants growing in consistent mathematical patterns, flowers and mushrooms the size of buildings, pebbles that are so light the drift on the air when kicked, and rivers and lakes that are impossibly deep.\n\nThe Reach is very cold due to its northern climate, but does contain some weather patterns and hot springs that allow for lush flora and fauna to survive.\n\n## History\n[[The Glassius Reach]] was not discovered by the outside world for some time after [[The Awakening]]. When rumors began about an [[Off-Human]] people who have the ability to take any form of their choosing, the dark folk-lore essentially created itself. Common folk began to accuse their friends and family of being '[[Changelings]]' who had killed and eaten their friends and had come to steal their coin.\n\nEventually, emissaries from the western world began to interact with The Reach. With increased exposure, the mythos around the [[Changelings]] began to dissipate a bit. However, the general fear toward the kingdom remained.\n\nSome brave [[Changelings]] venture out into the the other kingdoms as proud members of their race, but most who do so under their natural disguise mimicking another of [[Zol]]'s [[Races]].\n\nDuring the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]] masking as important members of western society. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would be called the [[Western War]].\n\nFought in the treacherous Pits of Zeralis, this war increased in intensity over a relatively short period and eventually amounted in the destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and the emergence of [[Ehmalog, Word of Wrath]]. A [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin who protects [[The Glassius Reach]] with his life.\n\nOne of the major results of this war was the loss of [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]]. An object so central to the culture of [[Changelings]] that it has caused irreparable damage to their society and people. In recent times, some of the changelings born within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] do not have the ability to change their form like the vast majority of their race.\n\nDespite the hardship and discrimination the people of [[The Glassius Reach]] have faced, they have gone to great lengths to preserve their way of life. The [[Changelings]] have succeeded greatly in upholding their culture considering what has happened to them.\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe population of [[The Glassius Reach]] is made up of almost entirely [[Changelings]].  A people with a very reserved, unique culture.\n\nThere are two things one would notice when first arriving in the cities of The Reach:\n- **Extreme Formality** - The people of The Reach have very set traditions, and procedures called The Pattern. The Pattern keeps society well mannered, fair, and efficient. The Pattern determines things like how long one should stay at a hosts house after eating dinner, how much one is allowed to drink at a wine house, and even important things like deciding a ruler. Ignoring these formalities is seen as extremely rude, and in many cases infractions against the rules of The Pattern are a punishable offence.\n- **True Forms, Pure Forms, and Pure Voice** - [[Changelings]] posses the ability to alter their physical form to any humanoid shape of their choosing, given they are still of the same approximate size and shape. This alteration is not the use of [[Illusion]] magic like many assume, but actual [[Transmutation]] of the physical body, even modifying things like sex and metabolism. This create an interesting dynamic where people have the ability to appear however they choose, even as other people. To combat this, as well as introduce some individuality, [[Changelings]] will often spend their youth conceptualizing an appearance called a **True Form**. A highly unique, detailed, and beautiful appearance that is almost impossible to counterfeit. this form is seen as sacred and is to be respected by all. Ones true form may make them appear as if they are made of translucent crystal, finely made porcelain, woodgrain, or anything one can reasonably imagine. [[Changelings]] use this form to identify themselves amongst their own society. It is illegal to attempt to counterfeit someone else's True Form, and it is extremely rare one shows their true form outside of The Reach's Cities, especially to outsiders.\n  \n  [[Changelings]] can also be identified by two other means: their **Pure Form**, and Pure **Voice**. These two traits being ones physical appearance at birth, and natural tonality of voice. These are seen as sacred and highly important to the [[Changelings]]. Some compare showing one's pure form to the concept of nakedness, but it is not quite that. There is no shame in doing so, publicly or privately, but one would not do so without thought.\n  \n  **Pure Voice** is another category of identification. Since [[Changelings]] can alter their appearance at will, physical traits are not as treasured when it comes to things like attraction or conventional beauty. However modifying one's voice, especially in a way that is pleasant sounding, is quite difficult for a Changeling. This makes having a beautiful voice an ideal within The Reach's society.\n\nThere are also a very small number of non-changeling peoples within The Reach. However these individuals had to go to great lengths to be welcomed into the xenophobic society of [[Changelings]]. They must follow strict rules and are always viewed as outsiders.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom of The Reach is governed by 2 individuals (one for each city) known as [[Shardcallers]]. Each is supported by their own council, all of which are democratically selected and extensively tested for their positions. Those in positions of leadership are viewed in a unique way within The Reach.\n\nElected officials are seen as being 'owned' by the people of the city. The live very strict lifestyles where their whole days are scheduled out. Things like dining and recreation time are predetermined for them. Their homes are open to the public (and highly guarded). Citizens can come watch the leadership eat, sleep, and work if they choose to do so. While this sounds demeaning to outsiders it is the highest honor of the [[Changelings]]. Those who seek these positions spend their entire lives training for the opportunity.\n\nThe [[Shardcallers]] of The reach are Yemodhan Surrite of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and Oseur Xetac of [[Corinth]].\n\nThe Reach has a socialist approach to its economy, and uses its own denomination of currency called a [[Glassmark]] which is divided into 4 types of coin.\n\nThe [[Glassian Laws]] are very strict, but well respected. [[The Glassius Reach]] has the lowest crime rate of all the kingdoms.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt is very important to the culture of The Reach. Individuals will become career artists to try and encapsulate the many complex factors and ideals within their society. Visual arts like painting are prevalent within the cities, but more commonly artists focus on singing and [[Form Art]].\n\nSinging holds a special importance within The Reach because of the importance of one's Pure Voice. Vocalists will occasionally play with instrumental accompaniment, but more commonly will sing acapella in grand opera-like performances. Frequently done in a theatrical manner.\n\n[[Form Art]] is a changeling practice of altering ones own form into beautiful or interesting ways. This is done to express emotions or for general entertainment.\n\nThe general society around The Reach is very strict, utilitarian, well mannered. Individuals will generally try and keep an indifferent demeanor and won't stick their nose into other peoples business. [[Changelings]] are very proud beings, to offend them is a very quick way to become an outcast.\n\nThe Reach is one of two kingdoms that does not implement [[Trains]] within its borders. Unlike the other kingdom who does not implement [[Trains]], [[The Ward]], The Reach does use [[Iron Light]]. They merely have not implemented the infrastructure. The [[Artificers]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] are behind in terms of advancements due to the isolation they face.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademics and magic are exclusively taught through formal tutelage. Most youth within The Reach are assigned a tutor, called an Abdector, at a young age that is with them all the way to adulthood. An Abdector holds the same importance as parents do in the culture of [[Changelings]]. An Abdector will focus on a main field of study in their teachings. They may teach an individual [[Magic]], general academics, economics, art, or a trade. Many students have the opportunity to dabble in various realms given their Abdector is willing and able to teach them. An individual is allowed to choose their own Abdector.\n\nThe Reach also has access to a unique manifestation of the will of [[Observance]]. This is obtained through interfacing with [[The Oldshards]]. What little is understood about this phenomena is extremely well guarded and is not known by many. Those who do have abilities granted by [[The Oldshards]] are quite powerful.\n\n## Political Climate\n[[The Glassius Reach]] has faced much destruction in its recent history. The Kingdom has a general hatred for the outside world, especially [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]]. The much of the The Three Corners returns the same sentiment. The Reach is however a small kingdom compared to its enemies, so it remains well defended in its borders.\n\nThe City of [[Yorn et Gaul]] faces a grim present. [[The Apex]], an object central and holy to the city was lost in the [[Western War]]. However the importance of this object was so great to these people. They still worship the grounds where it was once held. They leave much of their holy buildings in their war-torn state as a remined of what they faced. Many seek to restore what was lost while others feel that the kingdom needs to change to adapt to the new world.\n\nRecently, some [[Changelings]] within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] are born without the ability to alter their form. Many think this is due to the loss of [[The Apex]].\n\n## Military\nThe kingdom has a comparatively small military, but there is no other army who would so willingly die for its kingdom. [[The Glassius Reach]] stood its ground for extended battles many times during the [[Western War]] despite having loosing numbers. This is due to the highly defensible position, and extremely hostile environment that does not favor outsiders. It also helps that [[Changelings]] can appear as their foes for ambush attacks. The kingdom has a relatively small navy as well, but they are not very vulnerable to sea based attacks due to the rough seas near Zhal.\n\n## Borders\nThe Reach borders the kingdom of:\n- [[Gethsemane]] via the [[Wrath Wastes]]\n\nIt also borders the wilds of:\n- [[The Blades]] mountain range\n- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]\n- [[Holyfield]]\n\nand has its coast on:\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.984305395Z","tags":null},"/The-Grand-Nothing":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Grand Nothing\"\n---# The Grand Nothing\n![[The Grand Nothing.jpg]]\n\ndescription\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **[[Gilligan's Lift]]**\n- **The Blowdown**\n\t- **Freshpool**\n- **The Evrodian Conflux**\n- **The Baradan Canyon**\n\t- **Canyon Deep**\n\t- **The Cracks**\n- **The Belowcean**\n- **Wiseman's Fear**\n- **Oceanfalls**\n\t- **Ze'mynan Falls**\n\t- **Wakefalls**\n\t- **Mistmaker Falls**\n\t- **Evrodian Falls**\n\t- **Narrow Falls**\n\t- **Widefalls**\n- **Ruin Sites**\n\t- **Site Herran**\n\t- **Site Litiom**\n\t- **Site Runemaker**\n- **Camp Ikas**\n- **Camp Ger'zar**\n- **The Edgeless Deserts and The Shallow Seas**\n\t- **The Shallow Coast**\n\n## Climate\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n\n## Inhabitants\n\n## Borders","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.988305351Z","tags":null},"/The-Great-Tracks":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Great Tracks\"\n---# The Great Tracks\n*What unites us*\n![[The Great Tracks.png]]\n## Construction\nThe Great Tracks are a wonderous feat of engineering. Designed by the combined efforts of [[The University]], [[Kerketh Academy]] and [[The Kybis Assembly]]. A complex combination of [[Iron Light]] and infrastructure that spans The Three Corners of Civilization. A network of [[Trains]] that allows for anyone, powerful or not, to cross [[Zol]].\n\nOriginally conceptualized for the purpose of unifying the people of [[Zol]]. Allowing for common folk to cross the too-dangerous wilds with ease. This vision was met with resistance from the more conservative members of society. However, even they could not deny the immense economical benefits it would create.\n\nThe design and production of engines was given to the city of [[Rails]] due to its central location. The cities name becoming the nickname for the tracks the [[Trains]] ran on. Their blueprints coming from [[Artificers]] from [[Kerketh Academy]].\n\nDroves of workers and garrisons had to perform long and drawn out missions to construct railways between cities. Monsters and beasts of the wilds would attack the workers daily. The only reason so many did the labor was the high wages for rail workers and security detail.\n\n## Modern Function\nIn the current day and age, the [[Trains]] are integral to society. Moving exports and passengers of all types. They move at such high velocity any creature or structure in their path is obliterated.\n\nRunning on the power of [[Nodes]] in a state of [[Space]], drawing them in at the nose of the train and converting them into motion. The operation of the complex [[Apparatum]] is performed by a conductor.\n\nThere is a monetary cost for using the [[Trains]], either as a passenger or using them for transporting goods. In either case, there is a spectrum of services all at different costs. This allows for even the less fortunate to use [[The Great Tracks]] if they are able to save for it.\n\nThe [[Trains]] move hundreds of cars long night and day. In almost all cases the tracks run outside of a cities walls, stopping at a local station. Their incoming is felt as rumbling earth, and a distinct, low hum.\n\n## Notable Exceptions\nSome cities, or kingdoms do not use [[The Great Tracks]]. Be it religious beliefs, geographical location, or cultural differences.\n- [[The Ward]] does not use [[The Great Tracks]] because of their disallowance of [[Apparatum]] for religious reasons.\n- [[The Glassius Reach]] is not included in [[The Great Tracks]] due to political differences and recent war.\n- [[Gethsemane]] only has a single train station in [[Mod Dranor]]. This is largely because of Xenophobia.\n- [[Heliodor]] has a station nearby located on the ground where individuals can take [[Airships]] to the city.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:25.992305308Z","tags":null},"/The-Hooded-Presence":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Hooded Presence\"\n---# The Hooded Presence\n*Wayward God of Shadows, Minor Deity*\n![[The hooded presence.png]]\n\nThe [[Fell]] god of deception, espionage, and trickery.

The purpose of the attack seemed to be a sort of raid. With their goal being to be to *harvest* the cosmic power held within [[The Trinity]].\n\nTheir strategy largely relied on the strength and surprise of their initial attack, continued by growing their forces with their parasitic nature. This strategy may have worked for them in the long run, if not for the fact that they chose to attack [[Kapesh]] initially.\n\nTheir goal involved stealing large conduits of [[Viridescence]], the primal power of [[Zol]]. It apparently has immense value amongst [[The Cosmos]].\n\nThe [[Illithids]] took [[Stigmata]] as their base of operations, and converted many [[Humans]] to [[Illithids]]. These new [[Illithids]] were originally subservient to the invaders, but their human stubbornness resurfaced in their personality over time.\n\nBecause of this, the [[Illithids]] faced a great deal of in-fighting and discordance amongst their ranks. The converted humans tried to seize power for themselves. This ultimately left the invaders open to attacks.\n\n[[Wordbearers]] and a large scale force managed to nearly wipe them all out in a single week once the effort was coordinated. Many [[Illithids]] fled to [[The Cosmos]] or hid in dark corners of [[Zol]]. Those that did not flee were captured and interrogated.\n\n## Aftermath\nThe captured Illithids were interrogated for information about the attack. It turned out that they were a small, unremarkable force from wastelands of a place they called [[The Space Outside Reality]].\n\nMuch of what is known about [[The Cosmos]], [[The Space Outside Reality]], [[Illithids]], [[Goh'zul]], and the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]] comes from these interrogations.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.008305134Z","tags":null},"/The-Immortal-Ocean":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Immortal Ocean\"\n---# The Immortal Ocean\n*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nThe Skyless Sea.

Sorrow, Majesty, and Luna.\n\n![[The moons night sky.png]]\n\nThe moons of [[Zol]] were once planets that were consumed by [[Goh'zul]] before his defeat. Their once life-covered surfaces were left to ruin within the stomach of the Great Old One.\n\nNow, the three planets grace [[Zol]] with beautiful illumination during its nights. The barren landscape has begun to stir with life again as strange beings have made homes there.\n\n## Sorrow\nThe smallest of the 3 moons. Sorrow is known for its yellow hue and planetary ring. The ruins of Sorrow are the most intact of the 3 moons, and house many treasures and secrets about [[The Cosmos]].\n\nMonsters inhabit its surface making it very dangerous to traverse, but the few who have the power and drive to go there quest for its treasure.\n\n## Majesty\nThe second largest of the trio, The Desert Moon. Majesty's surface is covered with vast dunes of white sand. While originally thought to be barren, it was discovered that deep below its surface lies caves full of valuable resources.\n\nGreat stellar expeditions have been made by powerful arcanists to harness these resources. Unfortunately these were rarely met with success as the planet is inhabited by colossal omnivorous worms.\n\n## Luna\nThe largest of the three moons, The Shifting Fate. Luna has strange properties that baffle scholars to this day. Its stony, crater-covered surface warps and changes with each passing day.\n\nDuring the late [[First Age]], academics noticed that they could predict the likelihood of incoming gales from [[The Storm Horizon]] based on the positions of craters on Luna's surface.\n\nAfter monitoring it for many years, academics noticed patterns when comparing it to historical data. The noticed relationships with things like the economy, plagues, crop harvest, and even the rise and fall of fashion fads.\n\nAcademics have yet to devise a consistent way to predict the meanings of Luna's surface beyond the storms, and may never do so. Some [[Witches]] claim to be able to read her surface, but do not divulge their techniques, nor provide proof.\n\n## The Forgotten Heavens\nAmongst these three planets, a single divine realm was shared. [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a place once abandoned like the moons were, now homes one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[The Night Empress]] resides in the strange and celestial plane where she watches all who move under the light of [[The Moons]].\n\n## Orbital patterns\nSorrow and Majesty orbit Luna. Luna herself remains stationary in [[Zol]]'s sky during night and day. [[The Moons]] are faint while [[The Sun]] is out, but vibrant and bright during the night.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.02430496Z","tags":null},"/The-Mortal-Coil":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Mortal Coil\"\n---# The Mortal Coil\nThe force that bonds a soul to a vessel, and disjoins them upon death.\n\n![[the mortal coil.png]]\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is a primal force that exists in [[Zol]], it is what causes things to live and die. Some think it is an effect of the way [[The First Tongue]] bound the [[Sea of Monsters]], making it part of [[The Trinity]]. Others think it is a force of its own.\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is maintained by [[The Coilwalker]]. Some think that he is its reason for its existence, others think him to be an avatar of its greater will. Regardless of what controls [[The Mortal Coil]], its power effects every being in [[Zol]], living or dead.\n\n## The Rules of The Mortal Coil\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is bound to a specific set of rules that determine the function of life and death across all [[Planes]] of [[Zol]].\n- Beforelife\n\t- little is known of the Beforelife, but it is thought that souls grow freely from [[Nodes]] in [[The Ethos]]. These souls are selected at random by [[The Mortal Coil]] to be bound to vessels. This binding begins Life.\n\t- Souls in this state are thought to be non-sentient, and only become true beings when they are bound to a vessel.\n\t\t- This is not the case for souls that are sent for rebirth after death. In this scenario, the souls-to-be-reborn are considered comatose, living beings. \n- Life\n\t- Life begins when a vessel is fully created and a soul is bound to it. This can manifest in a number of ways\n\t\t- Successfully completed reproduction\n\t\t\t- A soul is only attached when a reproductive creature fully forms a child that successfully hatches, or is birthed\n\t\t- Homunculum\n\t\t\t- The creation of an artificial vessel fit enough for a soul to enter it\n\t\t\t- This can manifest in many ways\n\t\t\t\t- A clone of a being is made via magic\n\t\t\t\t- elemental forces are bent to house a soul\n\t\t\t\t- [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]\n\t\t\t\t\t- A newly discovered method of creating life where a complex enough creation of [[Iron Light]] is made and it becomes sentient.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is how beings like [[Warforged]] come to life\n\t\t- Divine Creation\n\t\t\t- When one of the [[Gods]] directly uses their power to create a vessel and injects a soul into it\n\t\t- Natural Spawn\n\t\t\t- When the natural world of [[Zol]] produces a being on its own\n\t- Life cannot begin on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, except for the case of Divine Creation where a powerful enough god manually seeks out a soul for the vessel.\n- Death\n\t- Death occurs when enough damage afflicts the system that maintains life. This can appear as\n\t\t- Damage to the vessel so great it cannot sustain a soul\n\t\t- Damage to the bond between a vessel and soul so great it causes them to separate\n\t\t- Damage to the soul so great it destroys the soul\n\t\t\t- This is the rarest death, as the soul is nigh indestructible. If this occurs there is no way to bring the being back to life.\n\t- If Death does occur, there are cases where magic can be used to restore life, given that the circumstances are correct.\n\t\t- If one does successfully restore life, the being will return with a scar from [[The Mortal Coil]] called a Mortality Rune ![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\t- Death cannot occur on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, save for the case of a soul being destroyed. A death off the mortal coils usually results in banishment to [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]], the [[Prime Material Plane]], or the plane from which they originated. They arrive on the brink of death. \n\t  \n\t  This is not always the case as some planes like [[Absurdia]] have their own rules about death off [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t\t- Any living thing can die so long as it is under the effect of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t\t- Something that is defined as ***Immortal*** is not killed by old age, and can withstand colossal amounts of trauma to their vessel, soul, and the bond between them without succumbing to death.\n\t\t\t- This principal is why the [[Gods]] spend most of their time outside of [[The Mortal Coil]], as it gives them much security from other powerful beings who would see them dead.\n- Afterlife\n\t- When death occurs, the soul (if intact) leaves the vessel. It is then guided by [[The Coilwalker]] to a new phase of existence based on the way the soul acted in its lifetime.\n\t- The paths a soul can take are:\n\t\t- Rest\n\t\t\t- If one of the [[Gods]] takes a liking to a given soul, the may be brought to stay with them outside [[The Mortal Coil]]. A peaceful eternity amongst kindred spirits.\n\t\t\t- If no god claims it, and the soul is unfit for rebirth or punishment. It is sent to [[Apolyatum]].\n\t\t- Rebirth\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth are sent back into [[The Ethos]] for their soul to be randomly selected for life again. If this occurs they are reborn with small slivers of their past lives interwoven into their being.\n\t\t\t- Slivers of past lives stay with souls, but are largely born without an sense of past life.\n\t\t\t\t- [[Magic]] investigation can expose truths about past lives.\n\t\t\t- Many things can spark rebirth. Magical influence, the will of a god, or even if the soul itself truly seeks it.\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth many times often go on to do great things.\n\t\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t\t- If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul, they are sent to limbo to undergo some trial.\n\t\t\t\t- Each trial varies for each soul\n\t\t\t\t- Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution\n\t\t\t\t- The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death\n\t\t- Punishment\n\t\t\t- If a soul has led a dark life, [[The Coilwalker]] brings it to [[Damnation]] upon death.\n\t\t\t- It is thought that [[The Coilwalker]] struck an accord with [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. This deal allows for [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] to claim some form of power from the deaths of [[Zol]]. In exchange he is to carry out the punishment for souls marked by [[The Coilwalker]].\n\t\t\t- Punishment varies in severity. Sometimes it is a light and temporary punishment like manual labor for a few hundred years. After which the damned are allowed to reside in [[Apolyatum]], the highest layer of [[Damnation]], the city of the dead.\n\t\t\t\t- Other times it is a more severe, and eternal punishment\n\t\t- [[Obliteration]]\n\t\t\t- If a soul is deemed too dangerous for [[Zol]], [[The Coilwalker]] will send a soul to the lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. A small and dark place called [[Obliteration]]. Here, giant beings made from obsidian destroy the souls sent to them with mighty hammers forged by Aldem himself.\n\n## Anti-Life\nOccasionally a powerful vessel or soul will exist without its bonded counterpart, and will somehow continue to function in a strange manner akin to Life. There are likely many things that can cause this, but few are known:\n- [[Magical Backfire]]\n- The will of one of the [[Gods]]\n- [[Necromancy]]\n\nThe result is a physical being who acts in one of two ways\n- Echoes\n\t- This occurs when a being survives having its soul severed, and no further will is imposed on it beyond the initial severing\n\t- The resulting being will attempt to continue their \"life\", but they do so without all of their emotions or memories in tact, resulting in strange behavior. Sometimes the physical body of this creature will also become monstrous in appearance.\n\t- Anti-life is reversible for Echoes if a soul can be rebound to its vessel, returning the being to normal Life again.\n- Undead\n\t- Vessels who have fully died, then given an artificial soul fabricated via [[Necromancy]].\n\t- This creates a being subservient to the will of its souls creator\n\t- The strength of the resulting being is dependent on the state of the vessel, and the skill of the souls creator.\n\t- These beings are typically more susceptible to further deaths as the bond between vessel and soul is not perfect.\n\t\t- But the severed artificial soul can be easily reattached and sometimes will do so on its own.\n\nBeings who experience Anti-Life are immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]] as they do not age and have greatly increased fortitude in many cases. A [[Lich]] is a being who does this to themselves intentionally, usually to gain immortality and pursue the dark side of [[Arcana]].\n\n\n## The Mortal Realms\n[[Zol]] has many [[Planes]] of existence that are all anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[The Mortal Coil]]'s influence does not exist in all [[Planes]]. This has an interesting effect on the behavior of life, death, and gods on any plane.\n\nThe [[Planes]] that contain [[The Mortal Coil]] are known as The Mortal Realms:\n- The [[Prime Material Plane]]\n- The [[Fey]]\n- The [[Fell]]\n- [[The Ethos]]\n- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\nDue to this fact, most [[Gods]] rarely enter these [[Planes]] themselves. When they do, they put their life at great risk.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.02430496Z","tags":null},"/The-Narrow-Sea":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Narrow Sea\"\n---# The Narrow Sea\n![[The Narrow Sea.png]]\n\ndescription\n\n## Climate\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n\n## Inhabitants\n\n## Borders","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.02430496Z","tags":null},"/The-Night-Empress":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Night Empress\"\n---# The Night Empress\n*Zolaen God of Night and The Moons, Major Deity*\n![[The Night Empress.png]]\n\nKnown for their mystery and matronly nature, [[The Night Empress]] is the cryptic mother of the [[Zolaen Gods]].

Similar to its parent, The Old Tongue is for lack of a better term, a language. Unlike modern language, The Old Tongue must be spoken with more than just words, and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The Old Tongue must be spoken with knowledge, emotion, will, artistry, movement, faith, and a strong [[Vizir]]. There are words in The Old Tongue, but they are fathoms more complicated than a mere dialect.\n\nThe Old Tongue can be used to harness great [[Magic]] via access to [[The Wills]]. Those who know even a small fragment of it are called [[Speakers]]. Access to this power is rare in [[Zol]], most people encounter only a single Speaker in their lives.\n\n## Usage and Learning\nBinding [[The Wills]] with the power of The Old Tongue is a step above binding them with one's [[Vizir]]. While the former requires great focus, and convincing ones mind of a reality different than that of what is occurring around them, The Old Tongues feels more akin to that of fairy tale magic. Rather than forcing ones will to bleed out into reality, reality naturally bends to fit to ones will. Almost as if it is doing what it is told. It is theorized The Old Tongue temporarily re-binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] itself.\n\nLearning The Old Tongue in any capacity changes a person. From their emotions to their very brain structure and physiology. Especially in the case of [[Arcana]]. Many who study in this field lose themselves to madness. Any being that possesses a Vizir may learn The Old Tongue.\n\nAdditionally, learning The Old Tongue does not come from books or lessons like other language. An individual must discover pieces of it on their own, almost like rediscovering forgotten memories. Great practice with one's [[Vizir]] is known to increase the likelihood of discovery. It is found by great willpower, dedication, craft, study, acts of heroism, and even traumatic experiences on occasion. Every individual uses it in a manner unique to them.\n\nNo one person knows the entirety of The Old Tongue, and it is theorized to be boundless. It is only referred to as a language as many [[Speakers]] have described it as such. Due to its nature it is very hard to record. Some [[Speakers]] have tried to make records, and collections of it, but they are kept very secretively. A runic language called [[Ralldung]] was developed for this purpose. \n\nMany also do not wish to share their secrets, as the power takes much to wield, and could do wrong in unprepared hands. Others merely do not want the unworthy to benefit from their hard work.\n\n## Individual Experience\nMany individuals describe their first experience with the Old Tongue as something unlike anything else. It brings you into a state where you feel for first the first time in your life, you are existing fully. A euphoric feeling is said to flood your mind. Your senses and emotions amplify to new heights. Colors are seen in their true forms, the edges of solid objects appear more defined. The air itself is said to feel like a sea flowing all around you, where all movement sends waves that can be felt all across your being. It has been called a 'drug like no other' by some. \n\nEvery account of it has these commonalties, but with a unique difference from person to person. Some say they are able to harness magic in a way only possible during the first encounter. Others say they witness events from the past, future, or other worlds. Some even claim to hear the words of the gods, or strange secrets spoken by [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAfter the feeling leaves, may people are left feeling emotional or lost. The feeling never returns with the same intensity. As one masters their craft in The Old Tongues their normal experience of reality begins to grow closer and closer to that of the first time.\n\nIt is believed that knowing something in The Old Tongue is the first step in learning it in [[The First Tongue]], but this is based more on intuition than fact.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n[[Speakers]] are both revered and feared across [[Zol]]. Many people believe they are the ideal of the sapient world, while others claim they are a large problem to be feared and avoided. The sheer amount of myth and legend alone that revolves around speakers is enough for common folk to acquire very opinionated stances on [[Speakers]].\n\nSome [[speakers]] hide their abilities while others wear it with pride. Sporting special jewelry and clothes to denote their status. Some cultures like that of [[Kapesh]] treat speakers as the highest degree of nobility.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.03630483Z","tags":null},"/The-Old-World-of-Zol-Excerpts-from-The-Grand-Nothing":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from The Grand Nothing\"\n---# The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from the Grand Nothing\nA highly controversial text on the archeological discoveries of [[The Grand Nothing]].

The myriad of people and chaos made for a wild expanse with little to no governing forces. The region was dubbed The Badlands, and few civilized people ventured there.\n\nEventually some groups gained enough power to establish themselves as coherent powers. As more and more of these groups formed, The Badlands became a feudal battleground. Small cities rose and fell constantly, dotting the area with ruins.\n\nSome groups rose high enough to gain legitimacy. It was at this point it became politically advantageous for the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] to support certain parties. They lent aid to the kingdoms of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] who would go on to conquer and found [[Eucaren]].\n\n[[Eucaren]] was originally on track to be part of [[Gethsemane]]. This development caused the rest of The Badlands to organize in response. The diverse kingdoms of [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]] were founded soon after.\n\nThese regions fought one another for quite some time. It was clear that [[Eucaren]] was much better off with the aid of [[Gethsemane]]. [[Saen]] had little in terms of resources due to their desert environment, so the made an alliance with [[Arcadia]]. This alliance gave the two regions enough capacity to take [[Eucaren]] from [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThere was a long time of disagreement, but a halfling politician and scholar named Perrial Galanor spent much time writing and speaking to the populations of the three kingdoms. She unified them under their shared history of The Badlands, and sought for separation from the [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] due to the their treatment of [[Off-Human]] peoples. The kingdom was named [[Laenwalde]], the gnomish word for perseverance.\n\nPerrial Galanor worked closely with the leaders of [[Eucaren]], [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]]. They were (respectively) Elrose Virrand a halfling woman, Tyran Urla a half elven man, and Fievar Cardanax a human man. These rulers wrote laws, trade agreements, and policies that would unify the three kingdoms.\n\nAmongst this unification effort, an institution was formed in the city of [[Ryze]]. [[The University]] was made to be an organization that would explore, document, and teach [[The Wills]] of [[Zol]]. These efforts would help bind the people of The Badlands with knowledge and the tools of [[Magic]]. Their mission was directly in line with the efforts of Perrial Galanor, the groups worked together because of this.\n\nWhile in the process of determining how the three would share rulership over [[Laenwalde]], a very high ranking nobleman of human descent entered the political scene. His name was Resh Tatelak. He was a kind hearted and charismatic man who had served in the military during the unification efforts under his brother who was the leader of the Arcadian Military. His reputation, bloodline and disposition made him the ideal king. \n\nThe three leaders along with their advisors eventually decided on an agreement where Resh would be installed as king, and they would bend the knee only to him and remain as the installed rulers of their respective regions.\n\nLaenwalde was founded in the year of 3201 and had three years of glory. The vast majority of its people respected the new rule and the cities profited greatly due to new trade routes and lowered military costs. Many loved King Tatelak and he was seen as the ideal all across [[Zol]]. His advisory council served loyally, now staffed with the best rulers of the regions and the most educated members of [[The University]].\n\nSadly this did not last long. Elrose Virrand was killed by a jealous lover, Tyran Urla fell ill with a mysterious sickness that made him unable to conduct much of his work and reduced his lifespan, and The King himself was accidentally killed breaking up a fight between drunk city guards. This threw [[Laenwalde]] into confusion. The people of the three kingdoms quickly grew anxious and unrest was seen in all classes of people.\n\nThe region was stuck in a halfcocked state and quickly shifted into chaos. King Resh Tatelak had no succession plan. The unity so many had worked for was on the verge of being lost for good, then Resh Tatelak's brother, Radavar Tatelak, next in line to the throne and leader of the King's army took the region by force despite his very legitimate claim.\n\nRadavar was by no means a politician, but was an excellent military leader. Once the kingdoms had their chaos quelled, Radavar took the crown as king of [[Laenwalde]]. He implemented his own version of what was to be his brothers rule, but in a manner that some would argue benefitted him a little too well. He greatly dampened the influence of his brothers advisors and had many done away with. This made for the largest kingdom in all of [[Zol]], under a rule of one specific man.\n\nRadavar's hostile takeover lasted for a few generations (103 years to be exact). His descendants were not nearly as gifted has him in military strategy. Civil war began and the Tatelak Bloodline lost the crown.\n\nMany many generations of political and military infighting occurred in Laenwalde. The kingdom was barely held together at the seams. There were times where alliances of cities broke off, only to later return. The only reason it remained mostly unified to this day as Laenwalde was the same reason it was originally founded: the advisory councils.\n\nThere were 8 major changes that occurred in [[Laenwalde]]'s rule from 3201 to 3812:\n- The Death of Resh Tatelak and succession of Radavar Tatelak, *ann. 3203*\n- The Overthrowing of the Tatelak Rule and the installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3306*\n- The Overthrowing of the Falava Rule and the installation of of the Gnoe Rule, *ann. 3353*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gnoe Rule and the installation of of the Veetro Rule, *ann. 3412*\n- The Penthe-Ryze-Kosskazoka secession and the ensuing Citywar that caused the fall of the Veetro Rule and instilled a complex multi-ruler temporary council, *ann. 3489*\n- The return of Penthe, Ryze and Kosskazoka as well as the installation of the Dax'cro Rule, *ann. 3502*\n- The Ejection of the Dax'cro Rule and the installation of of the Gold Council. A complex organization that served as a group of leaders that would rule as a collective. This group frequently had members change due to a high degree of political drama, espionage and assassination, *ann. 3503*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gold Council and the re-installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3758*\n\nLaenwalde's courts and battlefields were an off-and-on, high-stakes game that came to an abrupt and grim end when [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked [[Audran]] in the year 3812.\n\nWhen the attack occurred, the Falava Bloodline was killed in its entirety. While gruesome, the attack pushed Laenwalde to unify against a greater threat. When the kingdom was left to recover from its wounds an The Golden Council was reformed and took the burden of rulership. This was only until a descendant of Resh Tatelak himself was discovered in the city of [[Woogis]]. His name was Byrell Tatelak. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed in the year 4259 and the floating bastion of [[Heliodor]] was constructed in the year of 4262.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.044304743Z","tags":null},"/The-Trinity":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Trinity\"\n---# The Trinity\nOne and the same with [[Zol]].

It is thought to be hidden away by the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\nDespite the [[Gods]] attempts to disjoin The Void from the lives of mortals, The Void is closely related to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It looms in [[Zol]]'s history, and threatens its modern days. Only kept back by the constant efforts of the [[Gods]].\n\nThere are many physical entrances between [[The Void]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. They exist at the lowest depths of [[Zol]]. Entrances in the deepest fathoms of the ocean lead directly to [[The Void]], and entrances in [[The Underdark]] lead into The Void's subplane, [[Damnation]].\n\n## Known Properties of The Void\nLittle is known about [[The Void]]. Many scholars and theologians gather what they can about the strange space in an attempt to protect mortals from it. However some seek its power in a dark pursuit.\n\nThe known properties of The Void are:\n- Entrance to [[The Void]] is similar to most forms of planar travel, but escaping it is extremely difficult. This is due to the will of [[Gods]].\n\t- Expeditions have been made there, but few have returned. It is thought a mortals easiest method of returning is through [[Apolyatum]], the highest level of [[Damnation]].\n- The [[Void Gods]] largely view this place as the true form of [[Zol]] and seek to demolish all other planes and return them to this state.\n\t- No hard evidence exists of any hierarchy between [[Void Gods]]\n- There are likely more [[Void Gods]] than what are known to mortals.\n- [[The Void]] has distinct depths.\n\t- [[Damnation]] is thought to be the most shallow part of [[The Void]]\n\t- The deeper one ventures into [[The Void]] the more dangerous and inescapable it becomes.\n- Death in the void is unique. Academics are not sure if it exists on [[The Mortal Coil]], but interrogated [[Demons]] revealed that if one dies in [[The Void]], their soul becomes homed to it and they are banished deep within its confines.\n\t- Effectively if one dies in [[The Void]], they are locked within permanently.\n\n## Damnation\n[[Damnation]] is a subplane of [[The Void]] and seems to feed off the unclaimed souls of the [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\n## Demons and Fiends\nResiding the the greater Void are many horrible beings called [[Demons]]. They come in great varieties and almost all have destructive intentions.\n\nWithin the subplane of [[Damnation]] resides a similar but distinctly different cast of beings called [[Fiends]]. To an uneducated eye they would seem the same as [[Demons]]. However there is a sole difference that divides them.\n\n[[Fiends]] are beings bound by oath to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they are caught by a greater demon betraying him their souls are instantly destroyed. Most [[Fiends]] are endlessly loyal to Aldem because of this.\n\n[[Demons]] however are not bound to serve a master if they do not choose to. This gives [[Demons]] a sense of pride over fiends that has forged a unique hatred between the 2 groups over many ages.\n\nThe two groups of monsters clash regularly. Mortals have even been known to gain favors from one group when sparring with the other.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.056304613Z","tags":null},"/The-Wandering-Gods":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Wandering Gods\"\n---# The Wandering Gods\nA group of powerful cosmic beings, alien to [[Zol]]. The wandering gods are heavily associated with [[The Undoing]]. Some believe they caused the event with the intention of taking [[Zol]] from the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Others believe that they came to protect [[Zol]] from future Undoing, as guardians who battle whatever truly caused it.\n\nBy their own definition, [[The Wandering Gods]] do not seek dominion like most powerful beings. They claim to instead be teachers to both [[Gods]] and mortals alike. While this is the reason most of their followers seek their guidance, others believe it is a thinly veiled guise which their true conquest hides behind.\n\nUnlike other [[Gods]], [[The Wandering Gods]] are defined by a moral rather than a domain. This is the lesson they claim to teach.\n\nName | Moral\n------------ | ------------\nGrimnore | Moral\nFang | Moral\nAgon and Ra'Queen | Moral\nRonk | Moral\n[[Cadence]] | Adaptability\nCrackle | Moral\nKaszu | Moral\nRaven | Moral\nHercan | Moral\nPersanius | Moral\nChorn | Moral\n\nWhile the wandering gods are not as powerful as many of the other [[Gods]] of [[Zol]] individually, they posses more coordination and cooperation than any other pantheon or alliance between divinities.\n\nThis close bond between all of [[The Wandering Gods]] lends them a great deal of agency in the world of [[Zol]], and [[The Cosmos]] beyond.\n\n## The Goal of The Wandering Gods\nThe followers of [[The Wandering Gods]] believe their mission is to give mortals safety and agency in a world overpowered by [[Gods]]. They claim to wander the cosmos, protecting the worlds they find from the threats once faced in their home world.\n\nSkeptics believe that this is a narrative told by [[The Wandering Gods]] to gather support in their true mission to dethrone the [[Zolaen Gods]] and take [[Zol]] for their own.\n\n## The Realm of the Wandering Gods\nThe Wandering Gods all share a single realm known as [[The Unknown Realm]]. Each of them possesses their own estate of the realm that bears its own unique qualities.\n\n## Symbolism\nAll wandering gods are identified by the same symbol, that of a question mark.\n\n## Followers\nThose who follow The Wandering Gods go by the name of Sworn Wanderers. There are not many who openly worship these gods and even fewer who define themselves as sworn wanderers.\n\nSworn wanderers seek to embody the moral of their chosen wandering god.\n\nThere are sub groups for each of the wandering gods, but the are known to frequently collaborate with one another.\n\n## Minor or Major Deities?\nMost [[Gods]] are categorized as either Minor or Major deities. The Wandering Gods are not fit well into this metric as academics are not aware of the extent of their power.\n\nThe Wandering Gods operate with an influence similar to that of Minor deities, but openly resist Major deities. It is not know if these behaviors are caused by limited power, coordination between gods, or oaths sworn. They do not seem to follow the rules most powerful beings do.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.068304483Z","tags":null},"/The-War-of-Lies":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The War of Lies\"\n---See The Destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]].","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.068304483Z","tags":null},"/The-Ward":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Ward\"\n---# The Ward\n![[The Ward.jpg]]\n\nCut off from the rest of the world, [[The Ward]] is a wild, untamed land where the only constants are the howling winds and the roiling seas. Its cities are built upon rocky cliffs, their halls and longhouses formed of stone and unique, indigenous wood resistant to breaking under high winds. The cities cling precariously to the edges of [[Zol]] itself. The people who live there are hardy, fierce, and no stranger to fighting against the elements and facing down the terrors of the sea.\n\nThe storms that rage across the kingdom are a fearsome force, capable of destroying entire villages in a single night. But the people of [[The Ward]]'s cities are all to used to this hardship, and they have learned to weather the storms as best they can. They build their homes to be strong and sturdy, with thick walls and roofs designed to withstand the strongest winds. All windows and doors face away from the North-East, towards [[The Storm Horizon]].\n\nDespite the challenges they face, the people of the kingdom are proud and noble. They are skilled warriors, fierce and brave in battle, and they have a strong sense of community.\n\nIn addition to the storms, the people of [[The Ward]] must also contend with the dangers of the sea. The waters around their realm are home to all manner of monsters and beasts, including dragons, sea serpents, and giant krakens. But [[The Ward]]'s Vikings are fearless sailors, and they take to the seas with confidence, using their long ships to brave the waves and explore the unknown.\n\nOverall, [[The Ward]] is a rough and rugged place, shaped by the forces of nature and the will of the gods. But despite the challenges they face, the people who live there are strong and resilient, bound together by their love of their land, honor, and their fierce determination to survive.\n\n## Cities\n[[The Ward]] contains the cities of:\n- [[Often]] - Home to the Greatest Martial Warriors of [[Zol]]\n- [[Fike]] - The Driftwood City\n- [[Hoss]] - The City of Melted Stone and Enslaved [[Dragons]]\n- [[Yoel Sundarum]] - The Mythic City of Ice, a distant and isolated place many believe does not even exist. It does not operate within the society of the other cities.\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\n[[The Ward]] is famously rocked by devastating storms on a weekly basis. These storms, thought to be sent by [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] are said to be of a divine purpose. Regardless of their intention, the winds would destroy any other part of The Three Corners in a single day. However [[The Ward]] is no normal kingdom. Millennia of destructive winds have shaped the kingdom, its people, and its wilderness into something nigh unbreakable. \n\nThe Storms themselves come on a semi regular basis. The slight irregularity of their arrival is not well understood, but their coming is heralded by individuals of a profession known as [[Stormcallers]]. This task was made easier when it was discovered that Luna, on of [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] displayed regular patterns on its shifting surface when the storm was a 3 days out. This allowed [[Stormcallers]] to better approximate the approach and greatly reduced the casualties of the profession.\n\nThe Storm is spotted as a large wave and massive cumulonimbus illuminated by lightning approaching at high speed. This manifestation of weather is know as The Surge. The first challenge The Surge poses is the wave. The Ward has overcome this challenge by constructing several breakwaters along the coast that take the brunt of the impact. These must be rebuilt after every storm. When The Surge makes landfall it is accompanied by a loud sound similar to that of something breaking the sound barrier. The initial impact is strong enough to throw boulders the size of of cattle.\n\nTo survive this, the people of [[The Ward]] reside in very strong structures specially made to deflect the wind. It is culturally recognized that when The Surge approaches, everyone locks down everything, and bunkers down inside. You could be fist fighting your worst enemy in the street, but when the winds come you table any conflict you have and get inside. Oddly, The Surge is not stopped by magical barriers. Many fool hearty [[Caster]]s have died thinking they could best the elements.\n\nPlants have adapted unique methods of dealing with the high winds. Low grasses and bushes will fully recede into the ground when agitated. The needles of conifer trees will retract into their branches like cat claws while their trunks depend on their natural strength and and extremely deep taproots for stability.\n\nMany animals have developed migratory behaviors, burrows, or armored exteriors to weather the storms. The beasts of [[The Ward]] are also a good indicator of coming storms within the span of a day or so.\n\nAfter The Surge passes, The Cascade begins. An approximately 2 hour long heavy downpour of rain still has winds high enough to throw a person many feet.\n\nAfter The Cascade comes the [[Stormdew]]. A unique phenomena where the heavy rain fades to a light drizzle over the course of about 2 minutes and a substance called [[Stormdew]] falls with it. [[Stormdew]] is a blueish-white, malleable substance that feels almost like clay. It is thought to be organic in nature but no one knows exactly what it is. Surprisingly it can be eaten or used as medicine, and is used everywhere in [[The Ward]]'s culture. It has a maple-like taste to it in the first half of its shelf life, that turns to a more acidic citrus flavor in its later stages of fermentation. It has a shelf life of just over a week, which works well as the falling of fresh [[Stormdew]] tends to overlap with the final days of the last forage.\n\n[[Stormdew]] is left all over [[The Ward]] in small deposits that look like little soft coins. It is foraged quickly and packed into jars once the rain begins to dry. It is used in baking, brewing and medicine. Sadly its short shelf life makes it very rare outside [[The Ward]].\n\nThe odd natural world that exists only within [[The Ward]] is a largely continental climate, but parts do see warm weather on a good day. Its shy plants, and armored beasts cover its beautiful landscape in abundance vanishing like specters at the sign of a storm leaving a barren wasteland of destruction. Then, without fail, the glory of its winding rivers and streams, now full to their brims with fresh fallen water, attract the animals to their edges. The flora soon blossoms from its safe hiding places and the strange cycle begins again.\n\n## History\nAfter [[The Awakening]], the people of [[The Ward]] found themselves in the most dangerous of regions. When the unprepared people were rocked by the storm for the first time, their population was more than halved. The survivors found refuge in caves near the base of [[Stormwall]]. For many years they would struggle in flooding caves, slowly discovering methods of surviving out in the storm.\n\nEventually, structural and agricultural methods had become advanced enough to support life on the surface. Many migrated to the seaside to harvest the bountiful aquatic life, while some stayed behind living more primitive lives.\n\nSix cities were constructed: Weldar, Vauz, Margith, [[Fike]], [[Often]], and [[Hoss]]. These cities prospered within the kingdoms unique way of life for many centauries. This was until the final years of [[The Dragon War]] drove many dragons to the North West near [[The Ward]]. This gave the region a disproportionately high number of dragons.\n\nThe final years of [[The Dragon War]] were exceedingly difficult on [[The Ward]]. The Cities of Weldar, Vauz, and Margith were destroyed. The other cities likely would have been obliterated as well, if not for the kingdoms sole advantage: the storm. The [[Dragons]] were not able to predict the coming storm as well as the citizens of [[The Ward]] were. When this was discovered, the dragons were baited out to die in the destructive winds. When the dragons caught on, brave warriors would hide in the dragons' lairs to ambush, or even capture them when they took shelter from the storms. These tactics would eventually go on to win [[The Dragon War]] in favor of [[The Ward]].\n\nThe people of [[The Ward]] have spent the majority of their history in isolation from the other kingdoms, only interacting with [[The Glassius Reach]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] on occasion for things like the import and export of goods or services. They have never gone to war with another kingdom, but this does not make them a stranger to warfare.\n\nThe cities of [[The Ward]] were originally all under their own rulership, each by an appointed throne called an [[Archon]]. These rulers all followed the leadership of Weldar's ruler, the Grand [[Archon]]. This balance was not respected for long as many of the cities were too proud to respect the rule of another.\n\nSkirmishes between cities began, both on land and at sea. They typically amounted to nothing more than an intense rivalry, but occasionally a city would have to surrender resources, or may even be captured for a short while. These bouts of conflict happened on and off until [[The Dragon War]]. To unite against their larger foe, the cities created a pact called [[The North Honor]] which disallowed fighting between the cities.\n\nAfter [[The Dragon War]] there was peace for over a millennia. The kingdom never rebuilt its lost cities due to its slow way of life and lost resources, but its citizens were happy. Then in the year 3842, the city of [[Hoss]] attacked the city of [[Fike]] in an attempt to claim it, breaking [[The North Honor]]. This rekindled the conflicts between cities. Now [[Hoss]] exists in isolation, attempting to overthrow its allied neighbors [[Fike]] and [[Often]].\n\nThe [[Archon]] of [[Hoss]] at the time, a Goliath man called [[Kereth Fjall]], began to call himself the Grand [[Archon]]. Apparently his turning on his allies was sparked by a series of prophetic dreams that his lineage would rebuild [[The Ward]] into the most powerful kingdom in all of [[Zol]]. Even in modern days his descendants uphold his dream, and push the conflict further.\n\n[[Often]] and [[Fike]] are bound by [[The North Honor]], they fight justly and honorably to attempt to uphold the peace that used to be. [[Hoss]] however uses any means necessary to win a conflict, as they idealize true strength as tenacity and fortitude over honor. They even continue the old, dark method of enslaving lesser [[Dragons]] to aid them in combat.\n\n## Inhabitants\nPopulated by mostly [[Humans]] and [[Goliaths]], and a minority of various other races. The region is relatively accepting of outsiders as they don't often get visitors. However 2 groups often face discrimination: [[Dragonborns]] and [[Warforged]]. [[Dragonborns]] are discriminated against due to their draconic blood, they are still allowed amongst society but many treat them quite poorly. [[Warforged]] are seen as sacrilegious due to their [[Iron Light]] physiology. They are usually killed or locked away in a dungeon.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe cities of the kingdom govern themselves and there is no singular ruler. [[Often]] and [[Fike]] are allied under [[The North Honor]] against their common foe of [[Fike]]. Within these cities, a ruler called an [[Archon]] sits upon the throne. Within [[Hoss]] leadership is passed down to heirs, but in the other cities it is voted upon.\n\nThe Kingdom is by no means wealthy compared to the others, but that has little effect on how they operate as [[The Ward]] is quite isolated. The common class structure of: Lords/Ladies, Common Folk, and Peasantry can be seen in its cities.\n\nEach city governs its own laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\n[[Religion]] is the grand motivator of [[The Ward]]. [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s influence is ever present within the kingdom's culture. The main ideals of the kingdom are that of strength, unity, and proving ones self to the kingdoms sole god, [[Adrathar]].\n\nArt and culture revolves heavily on the idea of communal gathering. Traditional dances, great feasts, competitions of strength, and music are highly treasured. People will gather in great hall's built to [[Adrathar]] for these events.\n\nMany warriors, usually the young, will take on a pilgrimage to venture out into The Storm Isles. The purpose of this journey is to prove themselves to [[Adrathar]]. One who takes this challenge is supposed to venture as far north east as they can, braving sea and storm. They are to push and push until their body gives out. Where the body stops, there is said to be a gift from [[Adrathar]]. This gift may be something simple like a stone or piece of driftwood that will bring their family great prosperity, but some have even found lost magical weapons. Then there are the rare few who are made [[Stormblessed]]. These individuals are said to be approached by [[Adrathar]] himself within a storm and given a gift of power. These gifts manifest as magical abilities of varying power. Some have received great strength or speed, sometimes even wonderous things like flight or the power to control lightning.\n\n[[Stormblessed]] are extremely rare and there is usually only one or two per generation. When one is gifted these powers they are accompanied by ever present marks on the body that look like war paint.\n\nThose who follow in [[Adrathar]] say he sends the storms to *prepare his people for what is to come*. This ominous verse is repeated all throughout [[The Ward]]'s culture. Non-believers think this is an engrained doctrine used by [[Adrathar]] to manipulate his people.\n\n[[The Ward]] also disallows the usage of [[Iron Light]]. It is not know why this is, but the followers of [[Adrathar]] see it as impure and evil. Usage of [[Apparatum]] is a crime within [[The Ward]].\n\n## Academics and Magic\nMuch education and apprenticeship within [[The Ward]] is conducted via private tutelage. Mentors will either accept payment for their services, or will seek out pupils and offer them teaching. It is a great honor to be offered such a gift and is almost never turned down. [[The Ward]] is not academically gifted compared to much of the other kingdoms, but there are a small handful of academics who are incredibly well accredited.\n\nThere is one academic institution within [[The Ward]], [[The College of Hoss]]. It is dwarfed compared to [[The University]], [[The Kybis Assembly]], and [[Kerketh Academy]]. However it does offer some very unique teachings. The college is a dark any mysterious place located on the very edge of The Three Corners. It rarely takes on students, and is known to be almost a sister-school to [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n\n## Political Climate\nOn good terms with its nearby kingdoms, [[The Ward]] is currently pressured only by its internal struggle between. [[Hoss]] and its rival allied cities of [[Often]] and [[Fike]].\n\n## Military\nThe kingdom has a considerably small amount of fighting troops compared to the rest of the world, but it probably has the most capable fighters. Fortunately for  [[The Ward]] its isolation and storms makes them undesirable for conquest. It has by far the best navy, but shares no sea with any of the other kingdoms.\n\nCurrently, the cities are undergoing a civil war. However tacticians and politician's believe that if they were to face an outside threat that the cities would unite against it.\n\n## Borders\n[[The Ward]] borders the kingdom of:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n\nAnd also borders the wilds of:\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n\nIt also contains the mountain range of:\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\nIts coast lies upon the edge of:\n[[The North Sea]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.07230444Z","tags":null},"/The-Wasp-Eater":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Wasp Eater\"\n---# The Wasp Eater\n*Void God of Plague, Minor Deity*\n![[The Wasp Eater.png]]\n\nHe who culls, King of Plagues, [[The Wasp Eater]] is a hyper intelligent being who claims to seek the fair destruction of life itself.

He created the pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]]. The Watcher was also the first being ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], the being who's corpse became [[Zol]].\n\nThe Watcher is seen as [[Zol]]'s founder, protector, and visionary by his followers. He guides [[Zol]] through chaos and suffering to a true and perfect paradise. Those who follow him and his will be reborn in the perfect world, and those who stray into sin will forgotten to time.\n\n## Depiction\nThe Watcher is depicted in 2 ways. The first and more simple is as an ordinary man. This may be of any age or creed. His skin is covered in scars from his battle with [[The Wretch]]. His Dagger, [[Voidbane]], is always present in some form.\n\nHis second form is one of legend. Described as an endless sea of celestial light and power. Scripture tells of mortals who were blinded when they gazed upon this form in the flesh. Clergy who claimed to have seen this form in dreams or visions describe an experience of passion, awe, and fear beyond that of anything else.\n\n## Symbolism\nThe Watcher's symbol is an empty arched door, matching that of the planar [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for divinity.\n\n## Behavior\nThe Watcher is known for being kind and protective to his followers, but direct and wrathful to those who would oppose him. The Watcher seeks to uphold his laws for the greater good of [[Zol]].\n\n## Realm\nThe Watcher resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], a celestial landscape above the clouds. It bears a valiant golden palace for the [[The Watcher]], some of his fellow gods, his greatest followers, and his chosen dead.\n\n## Worshipers\nThe followers of The Watcher are conservative in nature. Following the rules set in scripture, these individuals worship and pray to their god of light in cathedrals all over [[Zol]].\n\n## Relationship to The First Tongue\nThe Watcher created [[The First Tongue]] when he spun the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]]. It is not known exactly, but it is thought that:\n- The watcher knows all words from [[The First Tongue]]\n- The watcher uses this power to achieve his god hood **or** the power proceeds from him, and [[Wordbearers]] are mere extensions of him.\n\t- The exact truth is not known, and sparks much debate amongst the clergy\n\n*Rendition of The Watchers ascendant form*\n![[The Watcher Aescendant.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.076304396Z","tags":null},"/The-Wills":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"The Wills\"\n---# The Wills\n[[The Wills]] are the three known possible manifestations of [[Magic]] sourced from [[The Trinity]].\n- [[Observance]], [[Magic]] connected to gods or some other source of power itself other than nature\n- [[Viridescence]], [[Magic]] connected to the power of [[Zol]]'s natural world\n- [[Arcana]], [[Magic]] pulled from the unbound power that exists all throughout [[Zol]].\n\n All power in [[Zol]] must manifest in one of these ways.

Home to beastfolk, bandit, witch and wizard that seek a lifestyle unoffered by the societies of kingdoms. [[The Witchlands]] were were relatively unpopulated by sapient beings at the time of [[The Awakening]]. This allowed for beasts and monsters to claim the region long before the kingdoms could even consider the feat.\n\nThere was a period of time in the mid [[First Age]] where [[Kapesh]] attempted this feat, but failed many many times. Eventually it was recognized that taming [[The Witchlands]] was too great a challenge, and no one has since tried to make a kingdom of it.\n\nDue to its dangerous environment, only the strong and powerful are able to make a sort of home in the region. Either that or an individual needs to be under the protection of a very powerful being. This has made a great home for those who seek to live outside the laws and cultures of normal society.\n\nThe region is taken by naturalists, wildly beastfolk, bandits, outsiders, wizards, and most notably [[Witches]]. Great and powerful wielders of magic have claimed the region in their own sort of way. As the witches of [[The Coven]] and [[The Cult of the Mothers]] spin spells in the remote corners of [[Zol]], common folk from all of spin tales of the strange things that go on within [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **Godwood Deep** - The deepest extent of the largest forest in all of [[Zol]], The Godwood, which spans [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Witchlands]]. Famously dangerous, the Godwood is sometimes referred to as 'the inside edge of the map' as it is largely unexplored and new things are constantly discovered within it.\n\t- **[[The Alktree Haven]]** - A remote convent of like-minded individuals who seek refuge within [[The Witchlands]] \n\t- **The Greatrocks** - A collection of massive boulders located in the very center of [[The Witchlands]].\n\t- **Old Barlen** - A collection of old ruined buildings mysteriously located within Godwood Deep. Not quite a town itself, but almost like a chunk of an old forgotten city. No one knows its origin, but it was discovered during The [[Beast Ire]] Plague. A nest of monsters to be avoided at all costs.\n\t- **Pine Valley** - A beautiful valley populated by many [[Beastfolk]]\n\t- **Z'veril Swamp** - A dangerous swamp that seems to try and swallow anything that enters it.\n\t- **Herzal Camp** - A large permanent camp of dangerous bandits known for causing trouble within [[Kapesh]].\n\t- **Robal Camp** - A large permanent camp of anarchistic bandits. Not known to be outwardly aggressive, but are highly territorial.\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\t- **Mortal Valley** - A cursed place known to be inhabited by Death [[Witches]].\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n\t- **Zorberg** - A tiny, out of place village tucked into the foothills of [[Demodemacht]]. This quaint town is kept safe by the [[Great Hearth Witch Luna Elzamore]]. It is home to the broken outcasts of society she has taken into her care.\n\t- **The Caverns of Ghar Nalon** - A complex cave system that goes deep beneath [[Zol]].\n\t- **Temple of the Moons** - A mysterious temple located within the peaks of [[Demodemacht]]. Inhabited by the infamous Sex [[Witches]]. Strangely, even if you know the way to this temple, you can only arrive at dawn. Otherwise it is hidden to any who seek it.\n\t- **Axidawn Valley** - The furthest north reaches of [[The Witchlands]]. Tucked into the mountains this valley is home to [[The Cult of the Mothers]]. It is said to be an absurd, and treacherous place.\n- **Everfall** - a large magical forest that is always stuck in a state of autumn. In some places the fallen leaves are piled so deep you can suffocate within them if you are not careful.\n- **Ghalt Kratur** - A unique crater that was present even before [[The Awakening]]. Made by a massive celestial object from [[The Cosmos]] that broke through [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Not only did the impact leave a fantastic geographical feature, but left a large hole within [[The Great Wall of Roots]] that allows for academics to perform interstellar observations of [[The Cosmos]] with a much higher degree of clarity than anywhere else in The Three Corners. Many [[Arcanists]] who reside in [[The Witchlands]] make this region their home.\n\t- **The Painted Stones** - A small canyon located within the foothills of [[Demodemacht]] where the stones are colored vibrantly. It is not know why this is, but some theorize it is an effect of the impact that left the crater. It is now home to many  Art [[Witches]].\n- **The Purelakes** - A collection of lakes, known to be home to strange creatures. Many believe the waters within the lakes posses magical properties.\n\t- **Lake Urir** - Technically within the borders of [[Kapesh]].\n\t- **The Long Lake** - A slender, seahorse shaped lake that exists at the edge of the swamps.\n\t- **The Corkum Pool** - Actually a salt water pool. It is surrounded by hot springs and geysers. The pool itself is not a true hot spring, but is warmer than its neighbors.\n\t- **Wizard's Well** - below this lake exists many water filled caves.\n\t- **The Axe** - The supposed home of the mythical 'Adowel, the Great Lake Serpent'.\n\n## Climate\nThe area is considered temperate-continental, but Everfall is an exception as the area seems to be locked in a constant state of comfortable autumn weather with bout of heavy rain.\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n[[The Witchlands]] have always been recognized as a place beyond the means of mere mortals, however there have been the tenacious few who have tried to make claim to it. Only the greatest have been able to do so. The largest organization to try, and fail in claiming it was the kingdom of [[Kapesh]]. They made many attempts at expanding their borders into the Godwood. Many outposts were built, most of which eventually fell to the beasts of the wood. However one has stood against all odds, [[Little Triumph]] remains to this day and has now grown into a small city.\n\nOnly smaller, less organized groups have been able to make a home within [[The Witchlands]]. These groups are:\n- The [[Beastfolk]] who rejected violent ways during the [[Beast Ire]] plague.\n- [[Arcanists]] who seek solitude. These individuals remain distant from civilization either for personal privacy, or to pursue research that society may deem problematic, dangerous, or dark. These individuals may organize in small groups or remain solitary. Regardless, to defend one's self they must be of above average skill.\n- Free thinkers of [[The Alktree Haven]]. A large convent built only a short distance from [[Kapesh]]'s border. A union of powerful mages, druids, clergy, and warriors who seek community or refuge outside the region\n- The [[Witches]]. A complex and powerful people who have the most widely known reputation of these wilds. [[Witches]] are powerful users of magic that span many practices. Each witch is unique in their use of the craft, but all share a rejection of the industrialization of the world. [[Witches]] uphold the natural beauty and disorder of things, treasuring nature, art, and the spiritual world. [[Witches]] do not subscribe to one singular doctrine, but tend to organize themselves in covens, sisterhoods, convents, and things of the like. Those who practice similar domains of witchcraft typically gravitate towards each other. \n\t- When the concentration of [[Witches]] first grew to such a magnitude that covens used to cross paths into each other, an overarching community was quickly formed. A group called [[The Coven]] was formed. 13 groups of witches each agreed on a single member from their smaller practices to represent them. They formed a coven so grand it would unite all witches within the region, a magical powerhouse that could rival kingdoms and would ensure none could bastardize the beauty and freedom of the region.\n\t- However during the late [[First Age]] an internal struggle began amongst [[The Coven]]. 4 of the 13 members had begun to gravitate towards the teachings of a darker magic. That of the [[Hags]]. The remaining 9 rejected their urgings to seek the eldritch knowledge The [[Hags]] were thought to posses. So the group was divided. [[The Coven]] became 9 and the 4 became [[The Cult of the Mothers]].\n  Despite their divided state, The influence of [[Witches]] is undeniably great within the region. The impact made by these groups was the cause for its namesake, [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Academics and Magic\nInformal education is conducted on a surprisingly great scale for a region without cities. [[Witches]] will teach each other skill and spells, secluded wizards may take the occasional student within their tower, and some students from the various academic institutions are urged to venture out into the region on a pilgrimage to obtain worldly knowledge.\n\nWhile their search for knowledge is a common trait, their crafts are not. Amicable groups will commonly spend time with one another to learn what they can. However these groups do not always play nice. Some wizards tend to view the witches as troublesome, uneducated, fickle, or merely and obstacle in their way to greater knowledge. Witches on the other hand view many wizards as problematic, destructive, and tampering with things they do not yet understand. There are frequent bouts of fighting between these groups.\n\n[[The Coven]] and [[The Cult of the Mothers]] has even resorted to fighting in recent years. Their differences have grown too much and [[The Coven]] fears what [[The Cult of the Mothers]] may bring into the world.\n\n## Borders\nThe region borders upon:\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]\n\nIt also contains parts of the mountain ranges:\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.084304309Z","tags":null},"/Transmutation":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Transmutation\"\n---# Transmutation\n[[Transmutation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

Separated by [[The Narrow Sea]], these nations have warred from roughly annum 2600 to 4000. Initially sparked by [[Gethsemane]] enslaving humans who crossed into their territories, and [[Kapesh]] doing the same with [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. [[Kapesh]] offered an exchange of prisoners, which [[Gethsemane]] rejected.\n\nThis rejection sparked conflict between the nations that lasted centauries. It wavered in intensity over the years, and its core motivation changed from enslavement, to expansion, to resources, and finally religious differences. \n\nFew major effects surfaced from the battles. The city of [[Riverbridge]] constantly changed hands due to its location on the border, slaves were eventually traded between sides for their freedom, any many died in the extended conflict. However, the conflict did give a foothold for the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Peak of the Battles\nThe peak occurred during annum 3673. [[Gethsemane]] had sought the aid of a powerful being from [[The Void]] called [[The Maul Bearer]]. A demon of great strength who was to be given any territory he conquered as payment, so long as [[Gethsemane]] kept him unbound from [[The Void]]. The demon and his army destroyed the [[Kapesh]] city of [[Rello Arr]] and its surrounding territory, creating the West Scars.\n\n[[Kapesh]] was able to kill the [[The Maul Bearer]] and his armies before they took [[Kierketholl]], but the attacks left [[Kapesh]] weak for generations. This weakness later gave way to the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Information on Slaves during the Battles\nEnslavement of [[Humans]], [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] sparked the initial conflict, and later became a bargaining chip between sides. These slaves began to be treated more as high valued prisoners than slaves, as their value in trades during conflict often outweighed their value as workers.\n\nThey suffered much injustice during these times, but the [[Off-Human]] slaves faced a much darker fate. The ways the nations had to stretch during wartimes depended heavily on the labor of slaves. The greater the stakes of the battle, the greater the mistreatment of [[Off-Human]] slaves. Many recognize this suffering as the greatest of all during the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\n## The Triumvirate Concord\nAfter the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] and the creation of [[Warforged]], the [[Triumvirate Battles]] entered a state of fast moving destruction and exhaustion of resources. The machines were so efficient at warfare they expedited the rate at which the conflict occurred. A sort of mutually assured destruction. This paired with vast numbers of [[Warforged]] going rouge made for very bloody battles.\n\nThis forced [[The Triumvirate]] to reconsider their disputes. The world had changed so much and it was evident how little [[Zol]] knew about itself. The kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] struck and agreement to stop the conflict, and release all slaves that were [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].\n\nPolitical amicability grew over time, but cultural divide never faded. Still to this day there is great disdain between the people of [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]].\n\nSince the concord, no major conflicts between kingdoms has arisen.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.128303832Z","tags":null},"/Uroga-Hag-of-the-Sea":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Uroga, Hag of the Sea\"\n---# Uroga, Hag of The Sea\n*Void God of Fathoms, Major Deity*\n![[uroga.png]]\n\nQueen of the deep, the most powerful of the mysterious [[Hags]], she who commands the horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean.

[[Viscera]] has a reputation for being an exceptionally strange city, especially when it comes to its nobility and night life.\n\n![[viscera.png]]\n\nDuring the day, the city is relatively quaint and quiet. Common folk work the farms and business bumbles away normally. This all fades away to strange parties, distant hysterical laughter, and growls of monsters (if you believe the rumors). Some say that it is urban legend, while others tell stories of curses from [[The Witchlands]] or that the veil between the [[Fell]] and [[Fey]] is thinner in [[Viscera]].\n\n![[Viscera Skyline 2.png]]\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | A city full of strange citizens and occult mysteries. The nightlife of the city is vibrant, and there always seems to be something mysterious and fascinating going on. |\n| Main Challenge | The nobility of [[Viscera]] have a lot of sway in what goes on within the city, and seem to get away with anything. They are very active during night life. Rumors exist about them living longer than they should and engaging in cult practice. Regardless of the legends about them, they treat the common folk like their playthings. |\n| Climate | Temperate/Continental |\n| Cuisine | Imported foods, wild game, fish, hearty foods, spirits, beer |\n| Export | Fish, spirits |\n| Size | Medium |\n| City Leader | Lord Hugo Sidgewick |\n| Primary Language(s) | Human |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Human |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Trinity-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Lakeside, Nightlife, Creepy Atmosphere |\n| Architecture | Gothic |\n| Color(s) | Black and Gold |\n| Symbolism | An interlocked Sun and Moon |\n| Defenses | City Garrison, Purelake Navy |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The high class members of society. Most of which are very eccentric and strange. They are typically very active in the city's nightlife and have a great deal of mythos around them. Some say they are secret cult members following some ancient and evil thing, while others go as far to say that they are secretly monsters who feed on the population. Either way the city lords of Viscera are known for letting them get away with anything they want since before even the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. |\n| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. These individuals typically do not go out during the active nights due to superstition. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work. Be it because of health issues, mental state, addiction, or some other personal reason. These individuals are extremely poor and are occasional persecuted for their begging and made to be slaves. |\n| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Castle Twill | Keep | The city's main keep |\n | Viscera Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle |\n | Viscera Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Crow's Nest | Tavern | A notable tavern amongst the common folk |\n | The Sharpe Inn | Tavern | An inn frequented by the more noble members of the city |\n | Aelorta Distillery | Tavern/Distillery | The most notable distillery in the city.

The lord is known for being very lenient with his nobility, rarely persecuting any of them for crimes of infringements. Some think the city is truly owned by Lord Vodeen, a high noble and head of his own house. House Vodeen has been upstanding in [[Viscera]] for many generations and owns the largest chunk of its resources.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Viscera]] is known to be a place worth visiting for  [[Kapesh]] nobility. Its balls and parties are very extravagant. A small portion of nobles who visit the city decide they want to live there permanently. An even smaller portion disappear entirely.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Many people go missing within the city, mainly slaves and beggars.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.132303789Z","tags":null},"/Vizir":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Vizir\"\n---# Vizir\nVizir is a fragment of [[The Trinity]] held within all beings in [[Zol]]. When harnessed, it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way, granting [[Magic]] power. It is largely thought to be the very essence of ones soul, and can be trained like a muscle.\n\nUtilizing one's Vizir is no simple task and can be very exhausting. It is typically accomplished in one of three ways for each of [[The Wills]] respectively.\n- **Faith**, for [[Observance]]. It requires that one believes in the power of their source, and that they themselves are a worthy candidate for it. Any shred of doubt weakens the channeled power significantly. The closer the bond between [[Caster]] and source, the stronger the [[Magic]]. This belief opens them up so the power of their source can pass through them, and be transformed by their will.\n- **Understanding**, for [[Viridescence]]. It requires one to mentally blur the line between self and nature, and allow for their will to bleed into the surroundings. This allows one to work with nature, or bend it to their will.\n- **Conceptualization**, for [[Arcana]]. The most abstract of the craft. Requiring a user to have a full image of the reality they are trying to create in their mind. It can be done in an infinite amount of ways, but is typically thought of in terms of [[Arcanists]]. \n\t- Take the example of an arcanist using a [[Spell]]. It requires one to visualize [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. These visualizations differ greatly from practice to practice, and even [[Caster]] to caster. These bonds can be relatively simple or immensely complex. For instance, the [[Spell]] Mage Hand (when taught academically) is performed by an arcanist who is visualizing a space near them to be directly connected to their hand, or the part of the mind that controls their hands. Even though the bond is non-existent, they must fully convince themselves of it mentally. On top of that they must utilize another part of their mind to draw [[energy]] from [[The Trinity]] to make the hand move and manipulate objects. This is called [[Splitting]]. Splitting is extremely difficult and gets very complex very quickly. Skilled [[Arcanists]] can split their mind dozens of times for complex spells, convincing themselves of non-existent realities that sometimes even contradict one another.\n\n## Other Methods\nAlternatively to that, other individuals have been known to use entirely unique methods to access any of the three wills. Like use of artistry to conceptualize the effect of a [[Spell]]. Some warriors will use their own blood to infuse their weapons with their [[Vizir]]. Others may not even view what they are doing as magic. Warrior monks will use great focus, breathing, and movement techniques to empower their physical body with Vizir, or [[Ki]] as they call it. Some are known to even surge with [[magic]] in the heat of battle, charged by rage or determination.\n\nThis has lead to intense debate amongst scholars and theologians. Many believe they have the true understanding to the shape of [[Magic]] and [[The Trinity]], but others argue only a sliver of information is known about the true nature of [[Magic]] and [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAnother practice of [[Vizir]] is the utilization of [[Iron Light]]. [[Iron Light]] involves inscribing runes on plates of iron to allow magical power to pass through them. The magic is source by a user's [[Vizir]]. The difference between this and all other aspects of [[Vizir]] is utilization of an object created with [[Iron Light]] requires no magical knowledge.\n\n## Connection to The Old Tongue\nGreat practice with one's [[Vizir]] is thought to lead to discovery of [[The Old Tongue]]. This leads to theories by some scholars that [[The Old Tongue]] binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] temporarily. Which largely increases magical power, and makes accessing it less exhausting.\n\n## Vizir 'Burning'\nA rare phenomenon observed most commonly amongst mages in battle. This phenomenon is described as a hyper focused state where one accesses their internal power with little to no difficulty compared to their normal experience with the practice. It was thought originally to be related to [[The Old Tongue]], but most scholars agree the two are unrelated.\n\nWhen one 'burns' their [[Vizir]] they go into a sort of trance, and experience the sensation of extreme heat within their chest. Iron within the vicinity is pushed back upon slightly like a repelled magnet, and silver is pulled towards the 'burner'. Individuals near a 'burner' can actually feel the repelling sensation, this is likely because of the trace amounts of iron within most people bodies. The force emitted from this individual is typically only great enough to knock over a stack of coins.\n\nWhile most commonly observed amongst mages, there have been record of warriors emitting the same repelling force in battle.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.132303789Z","tags":null},"/Void-Gods":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Void Gods\"\n---# Void Gods\n*Fear the depth of Zol, for not even the Gods know what true horrors lurk in its void*\n\nThe Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]].

These people, made up of a diverse set of individuals, would travel all across Zol in different clans. They would put their faith in the concept of fate, drawing from sacred decks called [[Tarot Cards]]. Attempting to read the fates via these cards to determine the best path for their people. During [[The Awakening]], on a day that is now known as [[The Tarot Convergence]], all of these clans were led to the same spot on the same day by the cards. It was there they founded Zessgorn.\n\n![[zessgorn 1.png]]\n\nA set of rings were forged to represent the card, [[The Rings of Tarot]]. The bearers of these rings were meant to act as leaders and protectors of Zessgorn, as avatars of the fates. In recent history they have become a scarce resource people will do dark things for.\n\nZessgorn is a beautiful costal city, it is known for its plethora of colorful tapestries that are strewn all about its city, gorgeous beaches, and [[Skytrack]] that carries passengers from the lower city to the keep.\n\n## Zessgorn's Strange Culture\n[[Zessgorn]] is known for its odd customs. Mainly for its rules regarding [[Zessgorn Cups]]. The people of the city all carry tankards with bottoms marked with [[Ferric Alphabet]] signets to designate their house, social standing, and who's protection they are under.\n\n![[zessgorn 2.png]]\n\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | While governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] on paper, the city follows ancient traditions regarding [[The Rings of Tarot]]. This makes for a city of with multiple people of high, competitive authority given by their possessed ring. People pay allegiance to these [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] in exchange for membership amongst their house. This includes benefits like social status, food, housing, protection, careers, and community. |\n| Main Challenge | The city once operated in a balance of powers for many years after the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. This was until [[The Page of Cups]] discovered a secret to her ring that gave her power far beyond that of her peers. This imbalance sparked disorder and chaos in [[Zessgorn]]. Now the city faces rivalry between houses, crime, and general disorder as [[The Page of Cups]] has essentially taken over as the city's ruler. |\n| Climate | Tropical |\n| Cuisine | Fish, fresh fruits, cheeses, olive oil, spiced bread, and wine |\n| Export | Wine, Fruit, Fish, Textiles, Salt |\n| Size | Large |\n| City Leader | Esartes Hald |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, vibrant, and the city's [[Skytrack]] |\n| Architecture | Cycladic, Fabric Canopies |\n| Color(s) | Gold, Maroon and Silver |\n| Symbolism | A ring with an ocean wave in the center |\n| Defenses | Large naval fleet, City garrison, House forces, [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| House Empress | Tarot House | The house of the [[Alderian Seat]] (the bearer of The Empress Ring of Tarot). This house contains only nobility, conducts their business very formally and by the books. Joining this house is no mere task of simple payment. One must be invited. This house also contains The Ring of Judgement, who's bearer conducts the court of law. |\n| House Cups | Tarot House | The wealthiest and second largest house of [[Zessgorn]]. Headed by [[The Page of Cups]], this house contains people of all social classes. It is the most powerful of the houses and has a reputation for criminal operations. Many view this as the city's true governing power. |\n| House Temperance | Tarot House | The means of production. This house is headed by The bearer of The Temperance Ring of Tarot this house owns the city's dock and is largely made up of working class individuals. This house controls the cities exports. |\n| House Hermitage | Tarot House | The house of the common folk. This house was formed in opposition to the need to join a Tarot House to achieve protection. Led by the bearer of The Hermit Ring of Tarot, this house is made up of the common folk as the house's taxes are by far the smallest. It is a passive house compared to its peers, but largest in numbers. |\n| Herald Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Herald Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people are of the highest standing in [[Zessgorn]]. |\n| Empowering Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Empowering Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]].

Most of which act as lieutenants for their respective houses, save for The Hermit who heads their own house. |\n| Lesser Ring Bearers | Misc. | A defunct group of individuals who possessed one of the Lesser Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people were of common standing in [[Zessgorn]].

Each has their own set of similar services. One can only shop at the market associated with their house membership. Each market reflects the general state of their house well. The Empress Market is neat and high class, the Cups Market is a chaotic bazaar, the Temperance Market is a utilitarian hub of trade, and the Hermitage Market is a humble square of shops. Magical items are difficult to find here as most are typically retained by a house for their power; magic items that are available are typically functional [[Apparatum]]. |\n | The Full Cup | Tavern | A massive tavern, central to a small complex of buildings that act as the headquarters for House Cups. Located in central Cups. |\n | The Hall | Tavern | A Longhouse style tavern attached to a large 4 story building, acts as the headquarters for House Hermitage.

This individual is responsibly for relations with the rest of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and protection of the city.\n\nIn reality, the city is now know governed by its four houses:\n- House Empress\n\t- Headed by Lord Esartes Hald\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Empress Ring** - Lord Esartes Hald, a middle aged gnome man\n\t\t- **Judgment Ring** - High Judge Relkar Treddin, an Old conservative dwarven man\n\t\t- **Justice Ring** - Inquisitor Gharn Vendur, a brutal and well trained goliath man. Father to Eldora Vendur\n\t\t- **The Tower Ring** - Lord Captain Eldora Vendur, a fiercely loyal goliath woman. Daughter to Gharn Vendur.\n- House Hermitage\n\t- Headed by The Hermit, aka Thorin Black\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Hermit Ring** - Thorin Black, an old and wise human man\n\t\t- **Death Ring** - Grudge, a massive orc man of few words.

Brother to Marcus Wanderer and seeming romantic partner of [[The Page of Cups]].\n\t\t- **The Sun Ring** - A man who simply goes by the name of 'The Sun'. No one knows their origin. They are mute, and fiercely loyal to [[The Page of Cups]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Zessgorn]] is known to be a problematic city when compared to the other free cities. This is because of the disorganized authority within the city. The [[Alderian Seat]]s of the kingdom constantly pressure Lord Esartes Hald to strike order within his city, as [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] depend on very specific political policies to maintain freedom and justice. [[Zessgorn]]'s reliance on rings damages this balance.\n\nThe relatively new disorder within the city has sparked a movement amongst the modern descendants of [[The Tarot]]. This fringe group determined that their people have strayed too far from the past, and have returned to their ancient nomadic ways.\n\n## Historical Importance\nDuring major historical events like [[The Dragon War]], the [[Beast Ire]] plague, and [[The Illithid Invasion]], Tarot power ring bearers fought as crucial warriors of eastern [[Zol]].\n\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Being within the city, and being without house membership is known as being *Cupless*. Cupless individuals have a very difficult time finding places to stay,  shop, or eat. These individuals are also typically preyed upon by petty criminals.\n- House membership is typically acquired by paying taxes to one of the houses, or giving some great gift or service to it.\n\t- One can also purchase temporary membership if they are visiting the city.\n- The city's dock is also a hub of pirate trade, but is done covertly to avoid prosecution.\n\t- Whole ships and their crew are all associated under the captain's cup","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.152303572Z","tags":null},"/Zessgorn-Cups":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Zessgorn Cups\"\n---Zessgorn Cups are a social tool utilized in the city of [[Zessgorn]] to determine someone's status and house membership in the cities complex socioeconomic structure. Said structure is largely determined by the remaining [[The Rings of Tarot]], and their respective houses. These rings give both magical power and social status.\n\nAll who enter Zessgorn must fit into the hierarchy of the city. Each person must carry a cup with them, with the symbol of the Ring Bearer they pay tribute to for protection and services.\n\nEach cup is unique, and given by a ring bearer themselves. If a ring bearer would die, their patrons would go to their successor.\n\n## Origin of Zessgorn's Cups\nBefore [[The Page of Cups]] came top power, [[Zessgorn]] sat in a state of careful balance since the end of [[The Dragon War]]. Even the [[Alderian Rebellion]] did not disrupt its long standing traditions.\n\nThe city operated by relying on the rule of those who bore the Empress and Emperor rings. These rulers, along with the other Herald Ring Bearers oversaw the city. They kept order by the aid of the Empowered Ring Bearers. As generations progressed, rings were passed to chosen successors.\n\nThe Lesser Rings were scattered amongst the common population to ensure the people of the city would never be without their own agency to push back against the ruling powers if they ever abused their own rings.\n\nIt was thought that [[The Page of Cups]] ring had a simple power, it allowed an individual to attune with an above average amount of magical objects. Most people's [[Vizir]] allows them attune to around 3, but the ring added capacity for one or two.\n\nThis changed when [[Rali Trunsarr]] discovered that [[The Page of Cups]] ring allowed her to attune to any number of the lesser rings, she enacted a plan to take the city for herself. She fought, stole, and bought all the lesser rings she could. This granted her strength, skill, luck, and magical powers. The lesser rings, while relatively unremarkable on their own compared to the Empowering rings, had a multiplicative effect. Rali's own personal power rose almost to a level of a [[Wordbearer]].\n\nThis sudden change to the power structure sparked civil war and riots within the city. [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] turned on one another as people tried to seize power or return order. The people of [[Zessgorn]] soon discovered that if one of the [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] kills one of their peers, it destroys the ring of the victim. This only increased tensions. Many rings were destroyed by assassinations or lost by the hands of fleeing [[Tarot Ring Bearers]].\n\nIn the end, the remaining major powers were The Empress Ring Bearer, The Judgement Ring Bearer, The Temperance Ring Bearer, and [[The Page of Cups]]. The bearers of these rings formed three distinct factions of power that settled an agreement to cease the city's fighting. Much tension stayed between these factions despite the agreement. No group played their hand and a divide was formed.\n\nThe common people started joining with these factions, going by the name of 'houses'. All but one of the remaining bearers of the Empowering Rings joined houses as high ranking members. The Hermit Ring Bearer was the sole outlier, they instead united the lowest class of citizens into a house of their own.\n\nIdentification between houses became important as tensions rose. Colors and garments were first used to display one's house membership but they became instrumental for espionage. The House of Cups was the first to implement a true solution to this. [[The Page of Cups]] employed [[Artificers]] to embed [[Ferric Alphabet]] Signets into the bottom of tankards. These allowed for her house to verify identity, membership, and status using magic. Important records, and documentation are created by the special offices amongst the House to audit this information.\n\nThis worked so well for House Cups, that House Hermitage and House Temperance implemented the same strategy. Both for its efficiency and to appeal to [[The Page of Cups]]. Eventually the majority of the city was using this method to conduct business and daily life, so House Empress followed reluctantly.\n\nIn modern day, the houses follow the tradition of succession, save for [[The Page of Cups]] who is immortal by the rules of the mortal coil. In modern day, even the lowliest citizens have their own cup.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T03:27:26.152303572Z","tags":null},"/Zol":{"title":"","content":"---\ntitle: \"Zol\"\n---![[Titlecard.png]] \n\n**Welcome to the world of [[Zol]]**\n\n*For easy map navigation, please see the [Kankamap](https://kanka.io/en-US/campaign/177268/maps/52803/explore) (Currently a work in progress)*\n\n## Steps for Zol's Creation\n- ~~Initial Skeleton of Site~~\n- ~~Introduction, Origin, and Homepage~~\n- ~~Magic system~~\n- Gods\n- ~~Planes~~\n- ~~Historical Timeline~~\n- Regions \n- Lore to fill gaps (characters, objects, events, and other specific concepts of note)\n- Kankamap\n- Final Cleanup\n\n*This is the checklist that I am following.
