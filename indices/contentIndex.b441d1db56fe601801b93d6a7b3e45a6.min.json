To make things more achievable some users will attempt to send only their perspective elsewhere, allowing them to acquire information while risking much less.\n\nThis magic is used with the intention of keeping ones mind continuous while the timestream is broken. This makes it very difficult to perform. Failures can be cataclysmic, or relatively harmless. In terms of harmless failure, you could go backwards in time, but lose all your memory of doing so effectively accomplishing nothing. Alternatively one could freeze time but also freeze themselves in the process immediately ending the spell, uselessly expending great deals of energy.\n\nMore commonly things could end up worse. A paradox could be created and cause the timeline to lash.

The Wandering gods swore an oath to prevent the Zolaen Gods from ever creating another Desolation.\n\nThis contest between pantheons paved the way for unending ages of religious confusion, debate, and war.  It also gave hope in a time of great fear. From this chaos, Zol rose from the ashes.\n\nAges passed for Zol. What was once a nation of refugees now resembled a society, but merely a sliver of what it once was. In these times, only the arcane and powerful had true agency, as the [[Untamed Wilds of Zol]] were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out, until the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.\n\nA powerful mage, named [[Mordenkainen]], devised a way for the common man to utilize and capture the magic of [[The Trinity]]. Complex practices and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs changed Zol forever.\n\n[[The Great Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and once unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were given the agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since the [[Desolation]].\n\nNow Zol sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity. A realm formed from the corpse of an infinite being. A developing world wrought with natural mystery, lost history, and unclaimed power. A world where anyone can claim their own destiny.\n\n## Where to begin\n- Read the [[Disclaimer]] to understand objectives this was written for\n- The [[Origin]], describing how this world came to be\n- [[Magic]], describing the forces that control this world\n- The [[Gods]], describing the beings who watch over everything\n- The [[Historical Timeline]], which describes major events that shaped modern times\n- The geography and cultures of [[Zol]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.521605244Z","tags":null},"/Iron-Light":{"title":"","content":"# Iron Light\nIron Light is a unique and efficient methodology used to simplify the usage of [[Arcana]] in the application of [[Enchantment]]. Named after the tell tale violet glow the application gives off, [[Iron Light]] was discovered by the great Arcanist and Academic, [[Mordenkainen]]. Its conception was what began the [[Second Age]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] revolutionized [[Zol]] by putting power in the hands of many who would be otherwise be at the whim of the world. Unfortunately, the technique has also introduced new dangers like new weapons of war, and the [[magic]] ailment known as [[Materiation]].\n\nIn its most simple form, [[Iron Light]] devices, also known as [[Apparatum]], are created via engraving special runes called the [[Ferric Alphabet]] into plates of Iron. These symbols channel [[Arcana]] similarly to how one uses their [[Vizir]], with the main difference being the user does not need to know the techniques required to harness [[Magic]]. They can achieve the very specific result allowed by the runes by lending their [[Vizir]] to it.\n\n## Examples of Apparatum\nSome devices made with [[Iron Light]] are quite simple. Blades that dull very slowly, stoves that heat without fire, lamps that glow without fuel, or even simple refrigeration.\n\nOthers are quite complex and powerful. Allowing for things like usage at range, multi-device cooperation, prosthesis, and mathematical estimation. Examples of this are long distance communication devices, flying machines, [[Warforged]], [[Automail]],weather and navigational systems, and even the [[Trains]] of [[The Great Tracks]].\n\n## Production and Economic/Societal Value of Apparatum\nThe creation of Apparatum is proportional to skill, quality of materials, and complexity of the design. Some designs take hours, while other take days or weeks. Individuals who create [[Apparatum]] are known as [[Artificers]].\n\nAs it takes much training to complete even a simple [[Apparatum]], they are costly. Those of the lowest economic status would be very lucky to own even a single [[Apparatum]], while those of common wealth will typically own one to three. For nobility, [[Apparatum]] are common place items. Their lavish homes are usually full of devices to increase their general quality of life.\n\nIn most civilized cities, there are common [[Apparatum]] that exist for use in business, or pubic benefit. These may be lamps that light the streets at night, or things like the [[Rift Smog]] filters in [[Tenzentak]]. Some civilizations have very particular views on [[Iron Light]]. The people of [[The Ward]] outlaw the usage of [[Apparatum]] based on spiritual beliefs.\n\n## Advancements in Iron Light\nIron light was originally limited to a small set of [[Ferric Alphabet]] runes, and slow production via iron engraving. Soon after the name was widely adopted, more symbols and compatible materials, and techniques were discovered.\n\nThe mediums to support Iron light spread to carpentry, glass working, alchemy, leathercraft, weaving, painting, smiting, and various other crafts. Each with their own pros and cons. The name, which references the purple light the runes emanate when active had already stuck. Fortunately, all techniques require some iron to be present to work. Be it metal inlay, infused materials, or special tools used in creation.\n\nA very popular and reliable technique was discovered for short term Iron Light solutions. A special material called [[Chalkstone]] was found to be very compatible with iron and allows for quick, and relatively accurate creation of [[Apparatum]] that last a small number of years. This is commonly used in novice work, prototyping, mass production, and education.\n\n## Discovery\nThe Arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] at the end of the [[First Age]]. He observed common patterns in the damage created by [[Magical Backfire]]. By intentionally increasing the damage of [[Magical Backfire]], he was able to spot runes amongst the damage.\n\nOne of these runes was found to appear elsewhere. In [[Necromancy]], a phenomenon called a [[Death Scar]] matched exactly to [[Mordenkainen]]'s findings. This led to many other successive discoveries of similar nature. These found runes would later be called the [[Ferric Alphabet]].\n\nAfter much experimentation with the runes, their interaction with iron was discovered. A decade of experimentation led to a single working lamp, and a basic theory of [[Iron Light]].\n\nLittle is known about why [[Iron Light]] actually works. It is widely accepted that there lies something within the properties of iron that mimics a living body, allowing it to share the powers of one's [[Vizir]].\n\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is assumed to be some product of [[The First Tongue]]. Since there is very little known about the origin of both subjects, the practice largely operates on assumption in this area.\n\n## The Ferric Alphabet\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is a wide set of runes that represent the aspect of [[Zol]] like [[Space, Matter, and Energy]] as well as the complex relationships between them. These runes are organized in an infinite amount of configurations to accomplish [[Enchantment]].\n\nThe alphabet is thought to be incomplete, and many academics spend their lives searching for more runes. Missing runes are symbolized by the combination of known runes, this is referred to as [[Imperfect Representation]]. For example, glass is represented with light and stone, along with a complex nexus of supporting runes to ensure the combination is successful.\n\n## Negatives to Iron Light\n[[Iron Light]] is revolutionary due to how accessible it makes [[magic]], but it is not nearly as powerful as [[Enchantment]] made from [[Grand Forces]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] also demands the usage of one's [[Vizir]], and in turn can be very exhausting if overused. Long term usage of complex [[Apparatum]] causes a rare magical disease called [[Materiation]]. This is only seen when the Apparatum in question requires an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. \n\n[[Materiation]] causes the afflicted's body to slowly change to a different material state. It is most often seen amongst [[artificers]] and those who operate complex [[Apparatum]] as a part of their career.\n\nThis could manifest as holes in the body that slowly pour out smoke, appendages that become plantlike, or famously like the Conductors of [[The Great Tracks]] who turn to iron. Though gruesome, the condition is painless and described by the victims as euphoric.\n\n## Iron Light in relation to Grand Forces\n[[Iron Light]] [[Enchantment]] is limited due to the fact it depends on the Vizir of an individual. Its more powerful counterpart, [[Grand Forces]], are not limited in this way. Objects of this nature are much more rare and powerful.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.521605244Z","tags":null},"/Jyrem":{"title":"","content":"# Jyrem\n*Wayward God of Vengeance, Minor Deity*\n![[Jryem.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.525605373Z","tags":null},"/Kahdinacht":{"title":"","content":"![[kahdinacht.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.525605373Z","tags":null},"/Kapesh":{"title":"","content":"Kapesh, The Human Kingdom of [[Zol]].

Kapesh is ruled by King Galliard from its capital, [[Kierketholl]]. Bordering [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]], Kapesh finds itself the most central kingdom in Zol.\n\nKapesh is the oldest kingdom in Zol, as it was founded shortly after [[The Undoing]]. The [[Humans]] population was scorned by the elves, dwarves, and gods. This made lives for humans more difficult at first, but quickly gave humans a reason to unify at a much faster rate than any other faction in all of Zol. \n\nKapesh's borders once included what is now the [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. When Kapesh first rose to power, all [[Off-Human]] races within its borders were heavily oppressed and many were forced to live as slaves. This was changed by The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. A civil war in which Kapesh lost its southern region to what is now known as The Free Cities of Alderun.\n\nThere is lots of superstition that regards humans as cursed, this belief is furthered by the problems that Kapesh has faced over the course of its existence. A kingdom located in a considerably inhospitable region filled with monsters, as well as a volatile population. It has faced unique and isolated plagues and famine. \n\nThey are also known for waging war in the past against [[Gethsemane]] multiple times. Known as The [[Triumvirate Battles]], the conflicts never amounted to much other than unnecessary deaths. The only territory that has ever changed hands in this exchange was [[Stalke Island]] and the city of [[Riverbridge]].\n\nKapesh is home to many practitioners of [[Arcana]], most notably at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. Little fact is written on what exactly occurs there. On its surface it is a scholarly place of magic. The rumor mill however, spins stories of arcanists who tamper with the dark unknown forces of Zol.\n\nThe Kapesh wilds are comprised of:\n- [[Thisper]]\n- [[Giant's Field]]\n- [[The Swamps of Viscera]]\n- [[The Godwood]]\n- [[The West Scars]]\n- [[Illpine]]\n- [[Stalke Island]]\n\nKapesh contains the Mountain Ranges:\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\nKapesh has coastlines on:\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]\n\nKapesh Borders the Regions:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Kathoor":{"title":"","content":"# Ka'thoor\n*Trade, culture, and loveable chaos*\n![[kathoor skyline.png]]\n\nKa'thoor, the Orcish City.

It manifests in 3 ways called [[The Wills]]. It is the poorly understood force that drives everything in [[Zol]].\n\n- [[Observance]], which is magic lent by beings of great power or derived from a spiritual bond formed with the soul of the world itself. Each individual who utilizes this will does so in a manner that is entirely unique to them. It can manifest as a radiant light that guides those who are lost, a dark power that draws in the vulnerable, and everything in between.\n- [[Viridescence]], which is magic found everywhere in nature. A source which requires great understating of, or domination over the natural world. This power allows anyone to bend nature to their will, and even bend their own form to that of the natural world.\n- [[Arcana]], the unbalanced, untied, and unknown chaotic power that saturates [[Zol]]. Arcana can be harnessed in an uncountable number of ways, but even scratching the surface of just one of these methods requires great knowledge, talent, and years of practice; however some gifted individuals can perform these acts based on their innate ability alone. Study of the Arcane can show one the great and wonderful secrets of the world, but can also drive some to madness.\n\n[[The Wills]] come from [[The Trinity]] and the rules that bind it called [[The First Tongue]]. This binding formed the very stone, sea, and sky of [[Zol]]. As well as the Magic that resides in it. By this rule, all magic in [[Zol]] must adhere to [[The Wills]] even if it hails from another world.\n\n[[The First Tongue]] itself is a power one can learn to control. It allows one to bend the rules of [[Zol]], as it is in its essence the rules themselves. Individuals who achieve full and uncontested mastery over a facet [[Zol]] may discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. In doing so they can perform wonderous feats of magic akin to that the [[Gods]]. This is extremely rare.\n\nAs use of [[The First Tongue]] is nigh impossible, other methods of harnessing the wills are utilized by the bulk of magic wielders in Zol. These other methods are:\n- [[Vizir]], a fragment of the Trinity that exists in all magic wielding beings. When harnessed it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way.\n- [[The Old Tongue]], the language that followed [[The First Tongue]]. While it is not nearly as powerful, it is much more diverse. It allows one to wield [[The Wills]] in a major way. Knowledge of this force may come with great secrets and dark truths about Zol.\n- [[Lent Power]], is power given by some wonderous source or great being other than [[The Trinity]]. When this power is bestowed upon an individual, it allows for them to circumvent the need for harnessing ones [[Vizir]] or learning [[The Old Tongue]]. This power cannot come from outside of [[The Trinity]] entirely. As all magic in [[Zol]] must be passed through it before reaching its intended target.\n\n![[Magic Diagram.png]]\n\n## Magic and Society\nThe people of [[Zol]] largely base their society and culture around some sort of magic. Safety and technology at a high level depend almost entirely on magic. This creates a strange dynamic for most of the population as only about 4% of individuals have the capacity to harness magic via gifts or training.\n\n[[Caster]]s are revered and feared because of this. The cultures and mythos of [[Zol]] are so intertwined with magic that no belief or practice is without mention of it.\n\n## Advancements in Magic\nFor almost of history, one could not access magical power unless they followed the specific known rules, or possessed an item that had undergone [[Enchantment]] via great magic. This was all changed when the great arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] and established the trade of [[Artificers]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] is a sub section of the minor will of [[Arcana]]. It allows one to extend their [[Vizir]] into an object, or channel [[The Trinity]] itself through the object. This is done by using rudimentary runes inscribed in iron plates, allowing for a more simplistic production of magical objects. This invention revolutionized [[Zol]].\n\n## Limitations and Weaknesses of Magic\nWhile powerful, Magic is not a boundless tool. In all cases, a [[Caster]] acts as a conduit for [[The Trinity]]. Acting as this conduit requires capacity and fortitude respective to the given task. All magic puts stress on a user, the amount of stress one can burden without hurting themselves is considered their limit. \n\nA body can only take so much stress before it needs rest. Stress can be mitigated by one's capacity. If an individual has great skill, or some innate gift they can use magic in more efficient ways to avoid damage to their mind and body.\n\nIf one does reach their limit, they are not cut off from magic. They are instead punished greatly by any further usage. This is called [[Magical Backfire]].\n\nMany magic users also have issues with nutrition. The stress magic creates on the body can cause food to metabolize very quickly. However, this is not the case for everyone. This is most common in the case of those who harness [[Arcana]].\n\n## Perspectives of Magic\nMuch of what is written and taught about [[magic]] comes from Academic Arcanists. In modern times, the public understanding of [[magic]] is somewhat biased towards certain perspectives. [[Clerics]], [[druids]], occultists, [[witches]], and many more have perspectives of magic that differ greatly, and even sometimes contradict the academic perspective. \n\nMost cases of [[magic]] usage outside of academic [[arcana]] are not recorded, tested, and debated like they are in Academic [[Arcana]]. This is because each usage is much more unique and personal. There is also much less need for it as these groups tend to being their journey with gifts, or help from an outside source.\n\n## Categories of Magic\nThe usage of magic gives off a unique informational [[energy]] signature no matter the source, will used, or the [[Caster]] themselves. These signatures are called the [[Schools of Magic]] and they tell much about the nature of the magic being used.\n\n## Forces Beyond Magic\nMany believe magic to be an all encompassing force to describe [[Zol]], but there are some who believe there is other power within the world that does not come from [[The Trinity]]. Any academic evidence of this is purely theoretical, and is largely viewed as some portion of [[The Trinity]] that is not yet understood. Some theologians however, claim to be quite sure of these sources of power. A large example of this is that of the [[Church of The Hum]] in [[Holyfield]]\n\nThe popularized theories for other sources are:\n- [[The Hum]] - a strange force that exists in [[Holyfield]]\n- [[The Mortal Coil]] - the force of life and death itself. Many Believe it to be part of [[The Trinity]], but others disagree based on the nature of the [[Planes]] and [[Necromancy]].\n- [[The Anger of the Stars]] - a strange phenomenon observed as power that radiates from somewhere deep in [[The Cosmos]].\n- [[The Anti-Trinity]] - a mythical force belonging to [[The Great Deceiver]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Magical-Backfire":{"title":"","content":"# Magical Backfire\nMagical backfire is the result of improper usage or over-usage of [[magic]].

In the case of damage to one's [[Vizir]], it results as a [[Caster]] having their magical capacity decreased, or lost entirely.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Maps":{"title":"","content":"# Maps of Zol\n[[Zol]] has many mapped regions\n\n## Region Maps\n\n## Mapped Wilds\n\n## Cities\n\n## Seas","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Necromancy":{"title":"","content":"# Necromancy\n[[Necromancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves meddling with a living or dead creatures life-force. It is considered to be the most controversial school as it possesses the power of healing wounds and disease, but can also extend ones life far beyond that of a normal mortal, or even bring the dead back to life.\n\nThis spawns massive ethical, and theological debate. The general population is made very uncomfortable by any usage of this magic that is not used for healing. All non healing magic is considered a crime in [[Laenwalde]], [[The Glassius Reach]], and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n## Effects of Necromancy on a User\nAny long term usage of this magic outside the realm of general healing seems to have a dark effect on ones mind and body. Physicality tends towards something monstrous in nature, and the individual's mind begins to lose the concept of empathy. It is not known why this happens. This does not seem to occur to those who revivify the dead using the will of [[Observance]] when reviving an individual who could be described as mortal.\n\nAny individual brought fully back to life via [[Necromancy]] permanently receives the mortality rune from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] somewhere on their body. This is commonly referred to as a [[Death Scar]] Successive revivals chain together It is not known as to why this happens, but there is a lot of superstition around these individuals. This contributed to the discovery of [[Iron Light]].\n\n![[Mortality Runes.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Observance":{"title":"","content":"# Observance\n[[Observance]] is the first of the three wills. It is [[Magic]] derived from another being, or conscious source of power. It is also referred to as [[Lent Power]]. The lending of this power comes from a bond between an individual and their source. Some examples of this bond are:\n- Devout Religious Belief\n- A Pact\n- A linked bloodline\n- Personal Bond\n\nAnd many others. This bond is not so easily gained.\n\nThe bond requires some direct connection to the source. A priest may spend his whole life devoting themselves to one of the [[Gods]], but that god may not see this person as a fit for their power and influence. Contrarily a priest may have been given a gift but choose to not use it.\n\nThese bonds typically come with visions, and sometimes the ability to speak directly to the source. \n\nThe power from a bond is only as strong as the bond itself, and gain become more powerful or weaken overtime. There are many records of individuals losing their bond entirely.\n\nAs is true for all [[Magic]] in [[Zol]], power from [[Observance]] must first pass through [[The Trinity]] before reaching its user. Many who utilize the will of [[Observance]] draw from [[The Trinity]] itself, and bear witness to some manifestation of it.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.529605503Z","tags":null},"/Ohlit":{"title":"","content":"# Ohlit\n*Zolaen God of The Sea, Major Deity*\n![[Ohlit the great jelly.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n![[The Great Manta Ohlit.png]]\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Origin":{"title":"","content":"# Origin\n[[Zol]] is the end of a cosmic cycle called [[The Circle]].

As he did, his body attracted a myriad of creatures from all across the cosmic sea. They gorged on his corpse for eons, forming The [[Sea of Monsters]]. Each and every being who partook in the flesh of the decaying god gradually lost their physical characteristics, devolving into worm like creatures. \n\nAt the heart of the writhing sea, lies the once core of the Great Old One. The core is a realm of its own called [[Oblivion]], and is home to The Great Old One's Soul. A Being called [[The Wretch]]. Since the defeat and imprisonment of the Great Old One, it has become the site of an everlasting duel.\n\nA fight between The Wretch, and the first being he ever consumed. The consumed man swore an oath to never let the creature return to its true strength.

Ordered from most common to least common:\n\n- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[Zolaen Gods]] created [[Zol]] and are the true and holy rulers of it. This belief system also subscribes to the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are malicious and that they caused the [[Desolation]]. It also entails that the [[Wayward Gods]] are dangerous and not to be trusted.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship one or many of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Regardless of their specific method of worship, it is generally thought that one should pay respect and worship to all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] from time-to-time.\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n- ### Trinity-Centric Belief\n\t- This belief system is based in the general idea that the pantheons of [[Gods]] are not the true ultimate power. They instead believe that [[The Trinity]] itself is the only thing deserving of worship. In this system, the [[Gods]] are either mere extensions of [[The Trinity]], or false gods. This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Great Deceiver]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship [[The Trinity]] as a whole or some specific manifestation of it. Like the [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[The Trinity]].\n\n- ### Wanderer-Centric Belief\n\t- Similar to Zolaen-Centric, this belief system is based on the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are more of guardians rather than [[Gods]]. They are thought to have come to [[Zol]] to protect civilization from the unchecked wrath of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. As per this belief system, the [[Desolation]] is seen as the fault of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Those who subscribe to this theory also believe that the [[Wayward Gods]] and [[Wordbearers]] are not all inertly bad.\n\t- Followers of this belief see [[The Wandering Gods]] more as companions rather than omnipotent rulers, guiding them in their struggles. Those who seek out [[The Wandering Gods]] may do so with just one, many, or to their leader [[All]].\n\n- ### Polytheism\n\t- This belief system recognizes each god as an individual being, and does not judge them based on their pantheon. Followers of this belief typically focus on a select god, or small group of gods based on the individuals selection. This system typically operates under the assumption that the [[Desolation]] was caused by the [[Gods]], but it is not know which gods. So judgement is not cast.\n\n- ### Atheism\n\t- This belief system operates based on the assumption that mortals need not revere [[Gods]], as they are merely beings. Their power does not make them holy, merely more present in [[Zol]]. The specific ideas differ from person to person, but largely revolves around skepticism towards information about the gods divined through worship.\n\n- ### Void Worship\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea of sacrifice in exchange for power from the [[Void Gods]]. A taboo practice in all of society, this belief is a dangerous and dark practice. Individuals who practice this faith are known for having twisted world views.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Religious-Organizations":{"title":"","content":"# Religious Organizations\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] is a complex thing.

These three concepts are all one and the same, merely in different states. These states can be bound and influenced, or shifted to another state using [[Sympathetic bonds]].\n- Academic Arcanists understand [[Zol]] an **infinite four dimensional grid of nodes**. Each one of these nodes are fragment [[The Trinity]], and exist in one of the three states: Space, Matter and Energy.\n\t- If you were to pick two points in space, each of these points could be represented as one node. In-between these two points there are an infinite number of other nodes.\n\t- One does not consider how they are acting on these states directly, this is merely a product of the used [[magic]]. Acting on nodes differs greatly given the state that the node is in:\n\t\t- **Acting on space** can modify gravity, teleport objects, and open portals.\n\t\t- **Acting on matter** can change the form, strength and mass of something.\n\t\t- **Acting on energy** is the most complex, useful, and common task of an arcanist. Energy can be applied, removed, transferred, and observed. The types of energy are\n\t\t\t- Kinetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that moves things. It is produced in a number of different ways, but largely is based around the motion of matter. Can be transferred quite easily with [[Sympathetic bonds]]. It used to both apply forces, and create/mask sound.\n\t\t\t- Heat\n\t\t\t\t- Different, but intersectional with the Elemental energy of fire. Heat energy is the energy created reactions, be it magical, biological, or alchemical. Heat energy can be channeled in and out of systems in large quantities with only a single bond.\n\t\t\t- Light\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that is produced by most alchemical reactions, and the presence of [[magic]]. It can both illuminate and darken. Used to create illusions, make things invisible, illuminate rooms,  and mask things in darkness.\n\t\t\t- Gravitational\n\t\t\t\t- The force of attraction between objects, and [[Zol]]. This is ever-present, but objects can be cut of from it partially, or entirely by skilled arcanists. This energy can also be synthesized or manipulated for interesting results.\n\t\t\t- Magnetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that gathers around, and interacts with metal. This is theorized to be responsible for the opportunity of [[Iron Light]].\n\t\t\t- Raw\n\t\t\t\t- [[Zol]] was essentially made from an endless well of power. When it was bound by [[The First Tongue]], much of it was turned into the world is understood to be. What wasn't changed is still present. This is Raw Energy, and it can still be harnessed.\n\t\t\t- Elemental\n\t\t\t\t- Within [[Zol]], there are certain substances or reactions that give off a unique energy which can be harnessed by arcanists. These elemental forces are:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: burning oil\n\t\t\t\t\t- Frost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: a blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t- Lightning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: static generated by rubbing wool against itself\n\t\t\t\t\t- Necrosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: rotting fruit\n\t\t\t\t\t- Radiance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: refined gold\n\t\t\t\t\t- Poison\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: death-cap mushrooms\n\t\t\t\t\t- Acid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: citrus\n\t\t\t- Cognitive\n\t\t\t\t- All minds emit and accept cognitive energy. This energy is extremely complex and difficult to understand or interfere with. A skilled arcanist can use this to communicate, create illusions, hurt, and even read minds.\n\t\t\t\t- Some academics believe this to be a subsection of Informational Energy.\n\t\t\t- Informational\n\t\t\t\t- All things emit a unique wavelength of energy based on the nature of their existence in [[Zol]] as a product of [[The First Tongue]]. This wavelength can be observed and translated into usable information in many different ways. \n\t\t- **Shifting states**\n\t\t\t- Changing a node's state to another varies in difficulty, but can be the most useful trick for an arcanist if done correctly. This practice is far out of reach for a beginner [[caster]], but is thought to be what makes an individual into a true arcanist.\n\t\t\t- Space can be turned to massive amounts of energy, the light of a candle can be used to form a suit of armor made from ice, an arrow flying for ones throat can be turned into nothingness.\n\t\t\t- Nodes changed eventually return to [[The Ethos]] to  revert back to their original state decided upon by [[The First Tongue]]. The amount of time before this reversion is based on the intention of the [[Caster]]. Once they return to their state they rejoin the planes to undergo this lifecycle again.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Spell":{"title":"","content":"# Spells\nA [[Spell]] is a repeatable method of harnessing [[Magic]] known to a caster.

This grants a [[Caster]] the ability to achieve multiple [[Sympathetic bonds]] at one time. These bonds can accomplish multiple separate tasks, or focus on the same task to amplify the effect.\n\n- Understanding this concept initially is extremely difficult, let alone learning it. To acquire this ability from the ground up, one must initially form the neural pathways to do so. This is done by very particular cognitive exercises such as:\n\t- Convincing ones self that a dropped object with fall upwards, then downwards, then to not fall at all. Then trying to convince ones self that combinations of these will happen simultaneously.\n\t- Sitting inside a warm room at a window with cold weather outside. Then convincing yourself you can feel the cold air, and that the exterior is heating.\n\t- Imaging that an unlit candle is emitting light in a dark familiar room, whilst trying to make the room itself fade from memory.\n\t- And other things of this nature\nAfter some time this practice will go from exhausting to second nature. At the point of this transition. One may begin to observe small, actual changes in their environment. At this point, practitioners can try to make small uses of [[sympathy]] like moving light similar objects, or lighting one candle with another at range.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Stigmata":{"title":"","content":"![[stigmata.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Sympathetic-bonds":{"title":"","content":"# Sympathetic Bonds\nA sympathetic bond is a mental connection formed by a [[Caster]] between Space, Matter, Energy and their own cognition. It operations on the principal of Likeness.\n-  A simple example of the usage of [[sympathy]] would be a [[caster]] with 2 copper coins on a table. The coins are in no way magical, but if the [[caster]] convinces a part of their brain beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are the exact same coin, they become sympathetically bonded. The [[caster]] can now convince an separate part of their brain in the same way that if one coin moves, the other will move as well. These 2 parts of the brain need to be entirely separated, almost as if they were separate minds on their own. This is called [[Splitting]]. When done successfully, any force can move one coin to affect both coins.\n\t-  If you were to lift this coin, you would feel that it weighs about twice as much as it should. This is because overall the coins are about 98% alike. They are the same material, shape, and carry the same significance. This is the principal of Likeness. In actuality, the coin would weigh slightly more than double, as [[Sympathetic bonds]] are imperfect.\n\t- One could also split their mind to bond them thermally. Tossing one coin in the fire would cause the other to glow red with heat sympathetically.\n\t\t- Other more complicated bonds could be formed. For instance, a feather of a raven could be used to hunt a partridge by snapping the birds neck. This is however extremely inefficient as they are only about 20% alike, and would require a great deal of [[Splitting]] and [[energy]].\n\t\t- Academic [[Arcana]] is based on finding very efficient, practical, and replicable bonds to create a [[Spell]].\n\t- The usage of these bonds in an ad hoc manner is sometimes referred to as prestidigitation.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.533605633Z","tags":null},"/Tellab-the-Wise":{"title":"","content":"# Tellab, The Wise\n*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*\n![[Telab The Wise.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.537605763Z","tags":null},"/Tenzentak":{"title":"","content":"# Tenzentak\n*The Rift City*\n![[Tenentak.png]]\n\nTenzentak, the Rift City.

[[The Alktree Haven]], is located on the southeast border of [[The Witchlands]] near [[Viscera]]. It is meant as a place for anyone of any belief to congregate. Within the safe-haven individuals can enjoy open-minded discussion, art, philosophical debate, sermons, and lectures.\n\n## Values (Neutral Good)\n*\"A place where any person, of any creed, can come to eat, drink, and think freely\"*\n\nAbove all else [[The Alktree Haven]] values peace, and the celebration of individuality. Its reputation is known all across [[Zol]] despite its small size. It is known as a place where anyone can seek refuge, knowledge and companions. So long as you bring good intentions to the tree, you will be met with open arms. \n\n## Origin\nThe haven began as a place of refuge during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Many who did not want to fight fled into the dangerous [[The Witchlands]]. So many of these people, driven from their homes, were lost to the dangers of the wilds. However, a small few discovered the haven guarded by a [[magic]] tree that warded off monsters.\n\nIt became a home for many, shared experiences amongst its residents drove them to aid anyone who needed it. Slowly but surely it grew in size and reputation. Its was given the name of a lost friend who had died protecting its grounds from bandits.\n\n## Structure\nThe haven has few rules and a very loose hierarchy.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- Two individuals act as the head of the organization. [[Hal Draen]] a soft spoken, old and powerful druid, and the eccentric [[Poldan Rike]] a gifted sorcerer. These two are well respected by many-a-traveler.\n- ### Size\n\t- The haven itself does not have any formal membership, but at any given time there are typically a few hundred people on its grounds at any given time. There are however a few thousand who have considered it a home at some point in their life.\n- ### Rules\n\t- All violence (verbal or physical), discriminatory behavior, and nationalism is banned within the grounds of [[The Alktree Haven]]. Violation of these rules results in banishment from the grounds, further infraction results in execution. This violence is only allowed when done in defense of the Alktree.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- A white mangrove tree on blue backing\n\n## Assets\n- The Alktree itself is a colossal mangrove tree with a hollow interior. The void within the tree has been filled with a large structure that is used by those who reside in the haven. The grounds around the tree contain a small village, all of which is considered the domain of the haven.\n- The haven has no formal defenses, but the tree itself magically wards off monsters\n- In times of bloodshed, any members capable of fighting would lay down their life to protect the haven.\n- Everything within the haven is given freely. Food, shelter, medicine, knowledge, and tools.\n\n## Relationships\n- The nearby nations respect the sanctity of [[The Alktree Haven]], but in past times there have been instances of bounty hunters causing a stir in search of their mark.\n- Many powerful witches of [[The Witchlands]] have sworn to protect it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.537605763Z","tags":null},"/The-Astral-Sea":{"title":"","content":"See [[The Ethos]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.537605763Z","tags":null},"/The-Bloodshed-Presence":{"title":"","content":"# The Bloodshed Presence\n*Void God of War, Minor Deity*\n![[The Bloodshed Presence.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.537605763Z","tags":null},"/The-Castle-of-Bodies":{"title":"","content":"# The Castle of Bodies\n*Void God of Wrath and Madness, Major Deity*\n![[The Castle of Bodies.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.545606022Z","tags":null},"/The-Coilwalker":{"title":"","content":"# The Coilwalker\n*Wayward God of Life and Death, Major Deity*\n![[The coil walker.png]]\n\nSummary\n\n## Depiction\n\n## Symbolism\n\n## Behavior\n\n## Realm\n\n## Worshipers","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.545606022Z","tags":null},"/The-Ethos":{"title":"","content":"# The Ethos\nThe space in-between the planes of [[Zol]].

This language is what binds [[The Trinity]] into all of existence within Zol. It is referred to as a language for lack of a better term. Unlike modern language, The First Tongue must be spoken with more than just words and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The First Tongue must be spoken with uncontested knowledge, unbound emotion, iron will, perfect artistry, exact movement, unwavering faith, and a [[Vizir]] like no other. The words of The First Tongue are so complex they cannot be recorded in any useful manner.\n\nThe First Tongue is thought to be a collection of names an rules for all things in [[Zol]]. As a result it is a broad language, but is theorized to have limits in this way. It is generally accepted that the only being to know the full span of The First Tongue is [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Despite the omnipotence this would give a being, his scripture claims he does not utilize this power as it would be unjust. This sparks debate among scholars and theologians.\n\n## Relation to The Old Tongue\nThe First Tongue is the predecessor of [[The Old Tongue]], and is much more powerful. An individual who knows a word from The First Tongue has full dominion over that element of [[Zol]]. This grants [[Magic]] power akin to that of a god. Acquiring a word from The First Tongue is arguably the single most difficult thing one can achieve as an individual in [[Zol]].\n\n## Discovery and Possession\nLittle is known about how to actually acquire a word from The First Tongue, and those who do know keep it a well guarded secret. It is thought that before [[The Undoing]], there were many who possessed words. In modern times, there are only 5 publicly known individuals who possess a word. They go by the title of [[Wordbearers]]. Rumors and legends tell of many more than 5, but that remains to be proven.\n\nDiscovering a word in The First Tongue is said to feel like witnessing the whole universe itself for a single moment. A second spans into an eternity and the truths held behind the word you have discovered come as no surprise to you, as you are their champion. They instead come as a comfort, a tool for you to shape [[Zol]] like no other.\n\nOne the major differences The First Tongue has over [[The Old Tongue]] is words from The First Tongue can be passed down to a worthy apprentice. This requires that the apprentice has studied for a lifetime under the [[Wordbearers]], and has a mastery over the subject beaten only by their master. This allows for individuals to complete a challenge far less great than discovering a word on their own. The word is passed upon death given the Wordbearer wills it so, and the candidate is worthy.\n\nThis has allowed some words to stay amongst the population for many generations, and has defined history in many ways. The words publicly known and available in the modern world are:\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- [[The Word of Shadow]]\n- [[The Word of Iron]]\n- [[The Word of Rage]]\n- [[The Word of Growth]]\n- [[The Word of Storms]]\n\nThere has never been a record of an individual possessing more than one word, nor 2 individuals possessing the same word. It is suspected this is a principal of The First Tongue, but it also may just be a product of its rarity.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.545606022Z","tags":null},"/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun":{"title":"","content":"The Free Cities of Alderun are comprised of 7 Cities.

Similar to its parent, The Old Tongue is for lack of a better term, a language. Unlike modern language, The Old Tongue must be spoken with more than just words, and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The Old Tongue must be spoken with knowledge, emotion, will, artistry, movement, faith, and a strong [[Vizir]]. There are words in The Old Tongue, but they are fathoms more complicated than a mere dialect.\n\nThe Old Tongue can be used to harness great [[Magic]] via access to [[The Wills]]. Those who know even a small fragment of it are called [[Speakers]]. Access to this power is rare in [[Zol]], but most people encounter at least one Speaker in their lives.\n\n## Usage and Learning\nBinding [[The Wills]] with the power of The Old Tongue is a step above binding them with one's [[Vizir]]. While the former requires great focus, and convincing ones mind of a reality different than that of what is occurring around them, The Old Tongues feels more akin to that of fairy tale magic. Rather than forcing ones will to bleed out into reality, reality naturally bends to fit to ones will. Almost as if it is doing what it is told. It is theorized The Old Tongue temporarily re-binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] itself.\n\nLearning The Old Tongue in any capacity changes a person. From their emotions to their very brain structure and physiology. Especially in the case of [[Arcana]]. Many who study in this field lose themselves to madness. Any being that possesses a Vizir may learn The Old Tongue.\n\nAdditionally, learning The Old Tongue does not come from books or lessons like other language. An individual must discover pieces of it on their own, almost like rediscovering forgotten memories. Great practice with one's [[Vizir]] is known to increase the likelihood of discovery. It is found by great willpower, dedication, craft, study, acts of heroism, and even traumatic experiences on occasion. Every individual uses it in a manner unique to them.\n\nNo one person knows the entirety of The Old Tongue, and it is theorized to be boundless. It is only referred to as a language as many [[Speakers]] have described it as such. Due to its nature it is very hard to record. Some [[Speakers]] have tried to make records, and collections of it, but they are kept very secretively. A runic language called [[Ralldung]] was developed for the purpose of this. \n\nMany also do not wish to share their secrets, as the power takes much to wield, and could do wrong in unprepared hands. Others merely do not want the unworthy to benefit from their hard work.\n\n## Individual Experience\nMany individuals describe their first experience with the Old Tongue as something unlike anything else. It brings you into a state where you feel for first the first time in your life, you are existing fully. A euphoric feeling is said to flood your mind. Your senses and emotions amplify to new heights. Colors are seen in their true forms, the edges of solid objects appear more defined. The air itself is said to feel like a sea flowing all around you, where all movement sends waves that can be felt all across your being. It has been called a 'drug like no other' by some. \n\nEvery account of it has these commonalties, but with a unique difference from person to person. Some say they are able to harness magic in a way only possible during the first encounter. Others say they witness events from the past, future, or other worlds. Some even claim to hear the words of the gods, or strange secrets spoken by [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAfter the feeling leaves, may people are left feeling emotional or lost. The feeling never returns with the same intensity. As one masters their craft in The Old Tongues their normal experience of reality begins to grow closer and closer to that of the first time.\n\nIt is believed that knowing something in The Old Tongue is the first step in learning it in [[The First Tongue]], but this is based more on intuition than fact.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n[[Speakers]] are both revered and feared across [[Zol]]. Many people believe they are the ideal of the sapient world, while others claim they are a large problem to be feared and avoided. The sheer amount of myth and legend alone that revolves around speakers is enough for common folk to acquire very opinionated stances on [[Speakers]].\n\nSome [[speakers]] hide their abilities while others wear it with pride. Sporting special jewelry and clothes to denote their status. Some cultures like that of [[Kapesh]] treat speakers as the highest degree of nobility.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.56560667Z","tags":null},"/The-Rings-of-Tarot":{"title":"","content":"# The Rings of Tarot\nThe Rings of Tarot are a set of magically forged rings created by the [[The Tarot]] people, during the founding of [[Zessgorn]].

He created the pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]]. The Watcher was also the first being ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], the being who's corpse became [[Zol]].\n\nThe Watcher is seen as [[Zol]]'s founder, protector, and visionary by his followers. He guides [[Zol]] through chaos and suffering to a true and perfect paradise. Those who follow him and his will be reborn in the perfect world, and those who stray into sin will be left to fall in darkness.\n\n## Depiction\nThe Watcher is depicted in 2 ways. The first and more simple is as an ordinary man. This may be of any age or creed. His skin is covered in scars from his battle with [[The Wretch]]. His sword, [[Voidbane]], is always present in some form.\n\nHis second form is one of legend. Described as an endless sea of celestial light and power. Scripture tells of mortals who were blinded when they gazed upon this form in the flesh. Clergy who claimed to have seen this form in dreams or visions describe an experience of passion, awe, and fear beyond that of anything else.\n\n## Symbolism\nThe Watcher's symbol is an empty arched door, matching that of the planar [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for divinity.\n\n## Behavior\nThe Watcher is known for being kind and protective to his followers, but direct and wrathful to those who would oppose him. The Watcher seeks to uphold his laws for the greater good of [[Zol]].\n\n## Realm\nThe Watcher resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], a celestial landscape above the clouds.

When harnessed, it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way, granting [[Magic]] power. It is largely thought to be the very essence of ones soul, and can be trained like a muscle.\n\nUtilizing one's Vizir is no simple task and can be very exhausting. It is typically accomplished in one of three ways for each of [[The Wills]] respectively.\n- **Faith**, for [[Observance]]. It requires that one believes in the power of their source, and that they themselves are a worthy candidate for it. Any shred of doubt weakens the channeled power significantly. The closer the bond between [[Caster]] and source, the stronger the [[Magic]]. This belief opens them up so the power of their source can pass through them, and be transformed by their will.\n- **Understanding**, for [[Viridescence]]. It requires one to mentally blur the line between self and nature, and allow for their will to bleed into the surroundings. This allows one to work with nature, or bend it to their will.\n- **Conceptualization**, for [[Arcana]]. The most abstract of the craft. Requiring a user to have a full image of the reality they are trying to create in their mind. It can be done in an infinite amount of ways, but is typically thought of in terms of [[Arcanists]]. \n\t- Take the example of an arcanist using a [[Spell]]. It requires one to visualize [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. These visualizations differ greatly from practice to practice, and even [[Caster]] to caster. These bonds can be relatively simple or immensely complex. For instance, the [[Spell]] Mage Hand (when taught academically) is performed by an arcanist who is visualizing a space near them to be directly connected to their hand, or the part of the mind that controls their hands. Even though the bond is non-existent, they must fully convince themselves of it mentally. On top of that they must utilize another part of their mind to draw [[energy]] from [[The Trinity]] to make the hand move and manipulate objects. This is called [[Splitting]]. Splitting is extremely difficult and gets very complex very quickly. Skilled [[Arcanists]] can split their mind dozens of times for complex spells, convincing themselves of non-existent realities that sometimes even contradict one another.\n\n## Other Methods\nAlternatively to that, other individuals have been known to use entirely unique methods to access any of the three wills. Like use of artistry to conceptualize the effect of a [[Spell]]. Some warriors will use their own blood to infuse their weapons with their [[Vizir]]. Others may not even view what they are doing as magic. Warrior monks will use great focus, breathing, and movement techniques to empower their physical body with Vizir, or [[Ki]] as they call it. Some are known to even surge with [[magic]] in the heat of battle, charged by rage or determination.\n\nThis has lead to intense debate amongst scholars and theologians. Many believe they have the true understanding to the shape of [[Magic]] and [[The Trinity]], but others argue only a sliver of information is known about the true nature of [[Magic]] and [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAnother practice of [[Vizir]] is the utilization of [[Iron Light]]. [[Iron Light]] involves inscribing runes on plates of iron to allow magical power to pass through them. The magic is source by a user's [[Vizir]]. The difference between this and all other aspects of [[Vizir]] is utilization of an object created with [[Iron Light]] requires no magical knowledge.\n\n## Connection to The Old Tongue\nGreat practice with one's [[Vizir]] is thought to lead to discovery of [[The Old Tongue]]. This leads to theories by some scholars that [[The Old Tongue]] binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] temporarily. Which largely increases magical power, and makes accessing it less exhausting.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.613608227Z","tags":null},"/Void-Gods":{"title":"","content":"# Void Gods\n*Fear the depth of Zol, for not even the Gods know what horrors lurk in its void*\n\nThe Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]].

If a ring bearer would die, their patrons would go to their successor.","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.617608356Z","tags":null},"/Zol":{"title":"","content":"![[Titlecard.png]]\n\n*Welcome to the world of [[Zol]]*\n\n# Quick Links\n*Before beginning, please read the [[Disclaimer]]*\n- [[Introduction]]\n- [[Origin]]\n- [[Magic]]\n- [[Gods]]\n- [[Historical Timeline]]\n- [[Planes]]\n- [[Notable Individuals]]\n- [[Notable Objects]]\n- [[Races]]\n- The Regions of Zol\n\t- The Three Corners of Civilization\n\t- Lorelhiem\n\n\n# The Regions of Zol\n## The Three Corners of Civilization\nBefore exploring this content please read the [[Introduction]] and [[Disclaimer]].\n\nThe Three Corners of Civilization are comprised of:\n\n8 Kingdoms\n- [[Laenwalde]]\n\t- [[Arcadia]]\n\t- [[Eucaren]]\n\t- [[Saen]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n\n6 Wilds\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]\n- [[The Kulpis Desert]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n- [[Holyfield]]\n- [[The Grand Nothing]]\n- [[The Underdark]]\n\nand 4 major seas\n- [[The Vast Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n\n![[Zol World Map v1.png]]\n\n\n## Lorelhiem\nA Distant and strange feudal land rumored to be far east of The Three Corners of Civilization, beyond the reaches of nautical technology and teleportation magic.\n\n(Note: This is the first planned future expansion of [[Zol]])","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.649609394Z","tags":null},"/Zolaen-Gods":{"title":"","content":"# Zolaen Gods\nThe pantheon of [[Gods]] that created [[Zol]] from the [[Sea of Monsters]].\n\nName | Domain\n------------ | ------------\n[[The Watcher in the Door]]| Light\n[[The Night Empress]] | Moon, Night\n[[The Lifeweaver]] | Nature\n[[Yanneran]] | Art, Wine\n[[Tellab, the Wise]] | Knowledge\n[[Giriam]] | Agriculture, Fertility\n[[Ayamot]] | Justice\n[[Ohlit]] | Sea\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.649609394Z","tags":null},"/energy":{"title":"","content":"See [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.717611598Z","tags":null},"/nodes":{"title":"","content":"see [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.885617045Z","tags":null},"/space":{"title":"","content":"see [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.961619509Z","tags":null},"/sympathy":{"title":"","content":"See [[Sympathetic bonds]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T12:20:55.989620417Z","tags":null}}
