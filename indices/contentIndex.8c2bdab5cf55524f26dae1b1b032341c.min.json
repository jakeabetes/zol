The surrounding kingdoms were oblivious to its existence. This was only until the mid [[First Age]] when some curious pirates noticed light beneath the waves, and dove down to discover a whole city of Triton. \n\nThe discovery of such a magical place is a wonderous thing, however no one initially benefited from [[Abdjadan]]'s discovery. [[Abdjadan]] immediately took to attacking any outsiders that approached, and the surrounding kingdoms were not happy to learn they had a potential enemy beneath the surface of [[The Archsea]]. \n\nThis tension only lasted about a hundred years, and some curious members of both surface and deep sea society began to try and explore each other's worlds again. Eventually, envoys from both worlds were able to cross over, but [[Abdjadan]] decided to remain disconnected. Triton who have entered surface society are the descendants of these envoys. What little is known about their society came from these few interactions, and the discoveries about the underwater city made by the surface only continue to prove more mysterious, strange, and even disturbing at times. \n\n![[abdjadan.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Abdjadan is an extremely well ordered city. Its citizens are devout followers of [[Ohlit]]. There is little problem with disorder and crime isn't a factor in the city's daily life. The city appears as a thoroughly planned out, and complete machine that serves [[Ohlit]]'s will. |\n| Main Challenge | The few who have been fortunate enough to enter [[Abdjadan]] claim that the city has a feeling of vacancy. It feels as if something within it is missing. Society is well ordered, but its people do not have the freedom to explore life beyond the city. This all stems from the well guarded site at the city's center. By the best guess of scholars, [[Abdjadan]] was built at [[Ohlit]]'s will overtop the most shallow fissure to [[The Void]]. Beneath the district of Saraxan lies a sea cave, called The Jaert'n Breach that is fortified by the vast majority of the city's forces. Here, warriors of the city fight of dark creatures who try and climb their way out of [[The Void]] |\n| Climate | Undersea |\n| Cuisine | Fish, sea vegetation |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Small |\n| Outer Villages| None |\n| City Leader | Queen Piton Amashal |\n| Primary Language(s) | Triton |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | [[Triton]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Followers of [[Ohlit]] |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Underwater City |\n| Architecture | Radially symmetric buildings, strings of round lanterns, glass domes filled with air |\n| Color(s) | None |\n| Symbolism | None |\n| Defenses | Army of [[Abdjadan]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group             | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Those of The Ring | Social Class | The city's royalty, or nobility.

Especially those who defend The Breach.                             |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is ruled by Queen Piton Amashal, a young Triton woman who has recently inherited the throne due to the unfortunate passing of their father, a previous beloved ruler. Queen Amashal is an ambitious but na√Øve ruler, and seeks to open channels of communication with the surface. This has created discourse amongst the city's people. However the first and foremost mandate is still upheld by the city: defend The Jaert'n Breach. This requires that nothing comes through the breach, and no one comes to tamper with it from [[The Prime]]. \n\n### Laws\nThe city does not have formal law because of its well ordered people, however the local authority would surely respond to anything most other kingdoms consider a crime.\n\nThe city also does not allow outsiders.\n\n## Modern Importance\nThe city holds little modern importance, but is commonly mentioned in stories and rumor. Particularly those of sailors.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city has little historical importance. The most notable thing about it is how long it kept itself hidden before it was discovered by surface dwellers.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Some believe that the city holds a great treasure, making it a common place of interest for pirates. This is based largely on the information the surface worlds knows about its currency.\n\t- The city does use currency, but exclusively gold coin. The conversion rates here are also not in favor of surface dwellers. A simple meal would cost 15 gold coins.\n- Beyond treasure, the city does contain a unique resource. The Jaert'n Breach emits unique magical energy, which draws in very unique sea life. The most consequential of which, is Riftshells. A cast of mollusks which feed off of microbes who thrive in the environment near rifts to [[The Void]]. Their shells are comprised of a unique material that is called Nacrem. When crushed, Nacrem combusts violently. It releases a great deal of air, light and heat. Some Riftshells hold very rare stone called Riftpearls. These pearls are extremely useful for artificers who wish to craft lasers, and transdimensional tools.\n\t- The people of [[Abdjadan]] utilize Nacrem reactions for many things such as illumination, heating, forging, and filling underwater spaces with air to be used as various types of infrastructure like temples, meeting places, restaurants, and spaces in which tools are created or used.\n\t- Nacrem and Riftpearls are very rare outside of [[Abdjadan]]. Many artificers on the surface would pay a great deal for these resources.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.64923277Z","tags":null},"/Abjuration":{"title":"Abjuration","content":"[[Abjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

It is unknown exactly what made [[Absurdia]], which only deepens the strangeness of the realm.\n\n![[Absurdia 1.png]]\n\n[[Absurdia]] is filled with whacky cities and strange individuals. The population native to [[Absurdia]] are known as the Absurd. They all seem to have an air about them that makes them feel like characters from a book.\n\nQuests, squabbles, feuds, parties, monster attacks, festivals, battles, and prophecies emerge on the daily within the odd realm. To the locals, the constant bombardment of events is entirely normal and no one seems to tire of it.\n\n[[Absurdia]] seems to contain many cities, all of which have very strange names like *Yorfinshire*, *Boogsley*, or *Gumpins*. Each city seems to have a stark rivalry with all other cities. It is not known how many cities exist, or how large the plane is. Many travel to [[Absurdia]] to see its strange wonders, and some even make a home there. \n\nThe few stories and texts that exist about it tell of wonderful adventures, and strange characters. However there does seem to be something *wrong* with the plane, a strange darkness that lies at its center which none of its residents will acknowledge.\n\n## Death in Absurdia\n[[Absurdia]] is not on [[The Mortal Coil]]. When a being native to [[Absurdia]] dies, they occasionally reappear after a short period of time that can be as short as one hour, or maybe as long as two weeks. When they return, they have no memory of their death, or the events leading up to it. To the Absurd, it is considered impolite to talk about the fact someone has died to their face. \n\nIf one is not native to [[Absurdia]], they are usually banished from the plane and sent to some random location on another plane. The few records of this tell of individuals being sent to the [[Prime Material Plane]], but there has been records of people ending up as far as [[The Moons]].

A type of [[Apparatum]] that uses Iron Light for long-distance communications. These apparatum are expensive, sensitive, and require direct connections to one another. These facts make complex communication networks a challenge. Adjuncts compensate for this challenge by acting as an third party during communications between individuals and organizations who interact via Span Read. Messages can be passed to other known clientele, or even passed to distant couriers who will attempt to hand deliver messages in the recipient's city.\n\nAdjuncts keep some of the most comprehensive civil records across [[The Three Corners]]. They track registered citizens, businesses, political organizations, noble houses, temples, churches, and outer villages with great verbosity. Their records aren't always up to date, but Adjuncts do their best to keep them relevant. Adjuncts are also very generous with their records, at least to other Adjuncts.

It involves the deconstruction and combination of substances in a scientific processes to create products that are greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThese creations may be medicine, dyes, inks, metals, cures, waxes, adhesives, solvents, acids, bases, beverages, cements, psychoactives, [[Pneumoactives]], potions, and poisons.\n\n## Mechanism of Alchemy\nAlchemy operates using what are called *Principals*. Principals are, in essence, the abstract pieces of a substance which emits the substance's Informational [[Energy]]. That is to say, they are the smallest, distinct arrangements of [[Nodes]] within a substance other than [[Nodes]] themselves. To break a principal down further, would just result in individual [[Nodes]].\n\nPrincipals are extremely unique in the fact that they exhibit a single magical trait based on what principal they are. Principals are extracted by exposing a substance to specific chemicals and magical processes. This breaks the substance down into what are called *Unbound Principals*. Unbound Principals seek to bind themselves to anything they can. Upon binding to another substance, the resulting product will be a new substance. However, not all reactions are favorable, and the vast majority are not useful or dangerous.\n\nThis is because the likely create something volatile, or the inert substance *[[Phlogiston]]*. [[Phlogiston]] (sometimes called Anti-Material), is the product of any reaction which causes loss. For example, when a log burns the material products are charcoal, ash, and a handful of various gases. However, there is also a great unaccounted for loss of material. This is because a great deal of the material is converted to [[Phlogiston]]. [[Phlogiston]] is wholly unreactive. As a solid, it appears as a very dark glass-like stone. As a liquid, it appears as very clear water. As a gas it is entirely invisible, but has a distinct sharp, fresh smell. The empty space within [[The Cosmos]] is actually very saturated with [[Phlogiston]].\n\nTo avoid this, alchemists will add their refined principals to substances which won't react with the given principal. An alchemist's goal is to combine principals with other principals and substances to create something new and useful. \n\nUnbound principals within one's body are extremely dangerous. They can cause a [[Curiosity]] known as [[Alchemist's Blood]]. [[Alchemist's Blood]] is a wide range of symptoms, all originating from a singular cause: the random binding of unbound principals to one's body. It can cause things as minor as a change of eye color, or the temporary curling of one's hair. More often, they are major symptoms like the fusing of teeth, losing the ability to lie, or delirium. Death is considered one of the better outcomes where [[Alchemist's Blood]] is concerned.\n\n## Examples of Principals\nThere are said to be an infinite amount of potential principals, any many are constantly being discovered. Every object is made up of a finite, but large number of principals. What follows is a list of various famed principals:\n- Fire\n- Water\n- Mass\n- Reflectiveness\n- Toxicity\n- Flexibility\n- Remembrance\n- Wine\n- Wake\n- Sleep\n- Protection\n- Vegetation\n- Age\n- Salt\n- Structure\n- Death\n- Purity\n- Cess\n- Healing\n- Memory\n- Strength\n- Concentration\n- Love\n- Digestion\n- Psychic Potential\n- Courage\n- Banishment\n- Flesh\n- Blood\n- Positivity\n- Negativity\n- Passion\n- Chaos\n- Attraction\n- Perpetuity\n- Spirituality\n- Renewal\n- Exorcism\n- Focus\n- Weather\n- Abundance\n- Soothing\n- Explosivity\n- Remedy\n\n## Similarities between Principals and Iron Light's Ferric Alphabet\nAcademics and Philosophers have sought a connection between [[Iron Light]]'s [[Ferric Alphabet]] and Principals since the discovery of the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. However a clear connection has not been found. The Majority believe that there is no *direct* correlation between the two, but rather the two sciences lead the the same end location; a set of low-level magical concepts used to control [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].\n\n## Grand Alchemy\nGrand Alchemy is a term used within alchemy to describe the creation of substances so potent that their effects are permanent. The ingredients used are exceedingly rare and extremely dangerous.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.660232826Z","tags":null},"/Aldem-King-of-all-Hells":{"title":"Aldem, King of all Hells","content":"*Void God of Hell, Major Deity*\n![[Aldem king of all hells.png]]\n\nLord of [[Fiends]], Conqueror of [[Damnation]].

After [[Goh'zul]] devoured their world, he would leave the Hells, for lack of a better term, undigested within his body.\n\nThis created a unique occurrence after the defeat of [[Goh'zul]]. More than a thousand hells drifted amongst his inner void. These unbound planes would collide with one another and fuse, eventually forming a single, unimaginably large realm of [[Damnation]].\n\nEach of these realms had their own unique environment, [[Fiends]], and rulers. These differences sparked a massive war amongst the [[Fiends]] within primordial [[Zol]]. After an eon of fighting, Aldem emerged as the victor.\n\n## Depiction\nA towering being of a stony black skin that houses an  ethereal red substance that flows all about his form. He bears no discernable face on his head and his voice emanates powerfully from him in all directions. \n\n## Symbolism\ncurved horns cradling a skull.\n\n## Behavior\nAldem is in his essence, a conqueror. He seeks any method possible of expanding his domain. He rules over all the layers of [[Damnation]] with an iron fist.\n\nAldem is thought to have a close relationship with [[The Coilwalker]], taking the unclaimed souls of the dead, or souls who have been marked for damnation.\n\nWhen one thinks of eternal damnation, the think of torture, pain and horror. Much of [[Damnation]] is defined by this idea, but [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] does not punish all souls he comes into possession of. Some souls end up in the higher levels of [[Damnation]] where the environment is more like that of a strangely beautiful city. While others are sent to the lower levels to atone for their crimes.\n\n## Realm\nAldem resides in [[Damnation]], a sub-plane of [[The Void]]. It exists at the border between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Void]]. It clings to [[The Underdark]], the stony foundation of [[Zol]].\n\nSome natural fissures to [[Damnation]] exists in the darkest depths of [[Zol]].\n\n## Worshipers\n[[Aldem, King of all Hells]] is praised by many dark cultists and other forms of villainy who seek his power, or favor in death.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.663232841Z","tags":null},"/Alderian-Council":{"title":"Alderian Council","content":"The [[Alderian Council]] is the governing body of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. Within their own city, they have the authority similar to that of a foreign city lord. However they are expected to uphold the mission of the whole council: maintain order and individual freedoms. Their station is gained by election from the public, and organizations from the region. Each member of the council represents one of the region's cities. \n\nThe [[Alderian Seat]]s are:\n- [[Tenzentak]] - Lady Helseena Trodak\n- [[Rails]] - Grand Artificer Janeesa Query\n- [[Holocene]] - Lord Leonell Vanveld\n- [[Deepspell]] - Lady Zed Dion\n- [[Zessgorn]] - Lord Esartes Hald\n- [[Hanen]] - Lord Poe Abbarand\n- [[Ka'thoor]] - Elder Err'del Raeshik\n\nEach city has a slightly different method of electing their officials. In some cities, the polls of individual citizens are prioritized. In others, the greater organizations like industries, political groups, guilds, and things of the like are more valued. However in each city, an individual does get a vote regardless of the exact weight.\n\nVotes are cast when an [[Alderian Seat]] leaves the position. This can be by retirement, death, or being ousted by the rest of the [[Alderian Council]] or their city. Polling is done by individuals queuing for Cast Stones. A Cast Stone is a small [[Chalkstone]] pebble with a small hole drilled in it. At the depth of the hole is character from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] that is randomly selected each time a vote is had.\n\nThe chosen symbol is random and not made public in advance of the polling. This serves two functions:\n- Fraud is much more difficult. The informational [[Energy]] of [[Chalkstone]] is hard to falsify as it is already minorly magical. It is also hard to drill and inscribe without cracking. Fraud does occur, however it is infrequent and on a relatively insignificant scale. Historically, fraud usually happens in favor of each candidate with the same relative frequency. This balances out the damage that would have been done. Modern [[Apparatum]] can also detect if multiple stones have been dropped by a single individual, however these are not often seen in small communities like [[Gate Town]]s and [[Outer Villages]].\n- Tallying votes is very simple as [[Arcanists]] can simply count the number of information [[Energy]] signatures that a collection of the Cast Stones would emit.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.663232841Z","tags":null},"/Alderian-Laws":{"title":"Alderian Laws","content":"This set of laws contains many of the main crimes that one could commit within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Slavery | High | No person is allowed to own slaves.

Most of the kingdoms resources were allocated to the coast of [[The Narrow Sea]] defending its borders against [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThis left South Kapesh without much of its normal defenses. Distant from the conflicts in the north east, a young [[Half-Orc]] man named Eirmond was born. Son of a prostitute, Eirmond was forced to watch the mistreatment of his mother and many others his whole life. When his mother was killed by an enraged human customer, he decided to begin a rebellion of his own. A campaign that would earn him the name [[Eirmond the Brave]].\n\n[[Eirmond the Brave]] and many other [[Off-Human]] slaves, primarily [[Orcs]], took [[Ka'thoor]] with great bloodshed. Despite the losses, it was the first time rebels had taken a city in [[Kapesh]]. Rumors spread quickly, and another rebellion was sparked in [[Hanen]]. After much fighting, and aid from rebels in [[Ka'thoor]], [[Hanen]] was taken as well.\n\nHuman nobility were executed, but the lower class human population was largely spared by Eirmond's mercy. These individuals were given a choice, aid the rebellion or face exile. Many resisted and some chose exile, but a sizeable group decided to stay and fight alongside rebels.\n\n[[Deepspell]] was the next strategic foothold to take, it was a difficult city to seize, especially with the aid of [[Kerketh Academy]] and their mages. It is likely the city never would have fallen, if not for a group of open minded students led by Alex Laro-Rissan, a charismatic noblemen's son who began a movement to stop the mages of the academy from fighting the rebels. Some say it was an act of honor, while others believe it was done in defiance of his parentage. Eventually it broke out into infighting within the academy. Ultimately rebels prevailed and the border between north and south [[Kapesh]] was secured.\n\nIt was at this time, the city of [[Holocene]] surrendered without prompt. The city and their nobles were kept safe and it became one of the rebels cities. This annexed the southern half of the region off from north [[Kapesh]].\n\n[[Rails]] and [[Zessgorn]] were taken soon after. [[Zessgorn]] notably by a group of slaves already within the city. This only left [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, this was when [[Kapesh]] began making headway with their counter-attack. [[Ka'thoor]] was retaken, and the human forces then moved on to [[Hanen]].\n\nRemarkably, [[Hanen]] held out against 3 major attacks by [[Kapesh]] with no support, and almost no resources. This one in a million chance forced [[Kapesh]] to retreat to [[Ka'thoor]]. They were ambushed by the forces of [[Holocene]] during this retreat, and [[Hanen]] was secured once again.\n\nThe rebels eventually retook [[Ka'thoor]], and all attention was turned on [[Tenzentak]]. The city's rough outskirts and defensible position made it for a long drawn out battle. It wasn't until a well trained group of [[Tabaxi]] rebels scaled the edge of the cliffs that overlook [[The Grand Nothing]] in great numbers and broke the outer walls defenses from the inside. In this victory the rebels took south [[Kapesh]] in its entirety. \n\n## The Founding of The Free Cities of Alderun\nAfter [[Tenzentak]] was taken by rebels, [[Kapesh]] attempted to retake [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Deepspell]], but were unsuccessful. The region was in a state of chaos, but had a hopeful air to it.\n\nEirmond and representatives from the cities met in [[Rails]] to establish a new government. The [[Alderian Council]] was formed for this purpose. A group of representatives, one from each of the cities, to serve the purpose of maintaining each city, and upholding the laws and values. The region was renamed [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Alderun meaning *hope* in Orcish.\n\n[[Kapesh]] did not recognize them as a kingdom for many years, but eventually caved to political and military pressures.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.663232841Z","tags":null},"/Alderian-Seat":{"title":"Alderian Seat","content":"See [[Alderian Council]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.663232841Z","tags":null},"/Amplidation":{"title":"Amplidation","content":"[[Amplidation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

The latter takes an extremely high degree of accuracy and training to perfect.\n\nMost commonly, Amplidation is used to manipulate gravitational [[Energy]]. There are 4 different types of gravitational bindings using [[Sympathetic bonds]]. These are:\n- Objective Ties\n\t- Causing a target to have gravity towards another\n- Directional Ties\n\t- Causing a target to have gravity in a set direction\n- Wells\n\t- Causing a target to pull or repel everything in its vicinity\n\nOther manifestations are\n- Frictional Manipulations\n\t- Causing a target to experience increased or decreased effects of friction\n- Inertial Flip\n\t- Causing a still object to begin moving with ease, or stop a moving object. The mass and energy behind an object increase the difficulty of this.\nIn all of these cases, a [[Caster]] can control the amount of forces that are influencing their target based on their skill.\n\nThese bindings are temporary, usually lasting minutes unless maintained by a [[Caster]] or some artificed mechanism.

Individuals can send messages over a great distance by writing on one surface, causing its counterpart to automatically make the same movements. It is crucial both implements are level so movements are transmitted accurately. This means that span reads do not operate well in the sea or sky unless gyroscopic mechanisms are included in their design. Devices are connected to each other via signets. Simple span reads have a single hard-set partner signet, while the more intricate ones have swappable signets or ones that can be configured to fit the user's needs. Many who utilize span reads will do so through a third party operator (usually a business) that will ensure their message reaches the intended target, assuming their recipient is included within their extensive archives of contacts. These businesses are called an [[Adjunct]]. |\n| Iceless            | A sealed box with an iron rod that moves heat along it from the inside of the box to the outside to preserve foods within.

Description |\n|-|-|\n| Sending Stone | Devices that have the capability of transmitting voice messages to other sending stones over great distances. Operating similarly to Span Reads, but transmitting sound rather than pen strokes. These devices also require signets in their implementation. |\n| Holdings | Containers that are larger on the inside than the outside, allowing for great storage |\n| Automail | Prosthetic limbs that give sense of touch, and sometimes abilities greater than that of its biological counterpart |\n| [[Warforged]] | A race of beings formed from [[Iron Light]]. These individuals can be made to very specific specifications to excel at specific tasks. In modern day, these individuals are constructed to be servile. |\n| Archival Index | A terminal device that can be used to index information within a library for easy retrieval. These devices are extremely expensive, and difficult to up-keep. Less than 15 are used across [[The Three Corners]]. |\n| Spacial Engines | Devices that can convert empty space into motion. The method of motion used in [[Trains]] and [[Airships]]. These devices are known to create extremely low temperatures so they typically use coal heat to prevent ice crystals (which could damage the ferric runes) from forming. |\n| Mass Reducers | Devices that are integrated into the whole of greater Apparatum to reduce their overall mass. Used in [[Airships]]. |\n| Firearms | A classification of projectile weaponry that leverages [[Iron Light]] for destructive capabilities. These devices can launch many types of ammunition depending on how they are made. In most hands these are far more efficient than bows or crossbows, but are expensive to acquire and maintain. In modern times a non-magical equivalent that uses black powder has been used widely, but these are not nearly as effective as Iron Light Guns. |","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Arcadia":{"title":"Arcadia","content":"See [[Laenwalde]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Arcana":{"title":"Arcana","content":"[[Arcana]] is the third of the wills.

Unlike its rival, [[Kerketh Academy]] which looks to innovation and a better future, the Assembly looks to gain the lost secrets of the past. This is done by uncovering secrets from before [[The Undoing]] and unraveling the mysteries of [[The Old Tongue]].\n\n![[archaic archives.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Home to [[The Kybis Assembly]], the city is known to hold secrets of the past that the institution seeks to unravel. These unlocked secrets tell us much about [[Zol]] and [[The Old Tongue]]. Within the city lies [[The Archives]], holding texts from all over [[Zol]] since the undoing, and rumors of ones from possibly even before that. |\n| Main Challenge | Sometimes secrets should stay hidden. [[The Kybis Assembly]] occasionally discovers something destructive and evil. On top of that, the Assembly is very secretive and protective of their information.

These students gain entry to the school via very high tuition costs and recommendation letters, or by direct invitation from an Insightor or reputable Preceptor. There is a comradery amongst students but it is usually overshadowed by the competition between peers. |\n| Preceptors | Social Class/Academic Station | The second highest level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are researchers given resources by the academy, and act as the professors of the more entry-level classes. This rank is typically granted when a student has learned a few words of [[The Old Tongue]].|\n| Insightors | Social Class/Academic Station | The masters level within [[The Kybis Assembly]].

This place of study is very secretive, exclusive, and expensive. Known to produce some of the most powerful mages in all of [[Zol]]. The college's focuses on unlocking the deepest, most powerful secrets of [[Zol]]. Located in the center of the city. |\n | The Grand Archives       | Library              | The largest, and oldest archives in all of [[The Three Corners]]. The Grand Archives contain more tomes than one could read in two dozen life times. Despite its central location to the city, its access is limited to assembly members. Furthermore many sections of text are off limits to most assembly members as well, as they contain forbidden knowledge. Located in the center of [[The Kybis Assembly]]'s campus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by Lord Philen Boran, servant to [[King Galliard]]. Lord Boran is an old and sickly human man that is fiercely loyal to the crown.\n\nNotably within the city, [[The Kybis Assembly]] does not respond to the authority of Lord Boran, but instead only listens to the [[Galliard Crown]] itself. Some within the city believe that the Grand Insightors have more authority than the city lord himself.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]], but many say the Assembly does not have these laws forced upon them like other organizations within the city.\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day [[Archaic]] is seen as a powerful resource to [[Kapesh]]. This is due to the influence of [[The Kybis Assembly]] on the grand scale. The assembly is much smaller in numbers than [[Kerketh Academy]] or [[The University]], but its members are statistically much more skilled and dangerous.\n\nEntry into the assembly is very difficult as it is extremely expensive and requires recommendation from an upstanding member of Kapeshian society.\n\nThe Assembly is mostly made up of [[Humans]]. Some claim this is just because of its location while others believe that it a product of racism. However the university has been accepting more and more students of various backgrounds over the years.\n\n## Historical Importance\nArchaic is the oldest city in all of [[Zol]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Those cast out from the Assembly are typically executed publicly if there is due cause, or die under mysterious circumstances if their departure does not merit execution.\n- The [[Fey]] city of [[Hymnal]] and the [[Fell]] city of [[Dislimn]] are located in the same place as [[Archaic]] in their respective planes.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Archaisms":{"title":"Archaisms","content":"See [[The Grand Nothing]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Archon":{"title":"Archon","content":"The name for a ruler within [[The Ward]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Arkian":{"title":"Arkian","content":"*In life we are impure, but in The Watcher's gaze we are seen anew.*\n![[Arkian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Arkian]] is a Zolaen-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that [[Zol]], and [[The Trinity]] by extension were created by [[The Watcher in The Door]] through [[The First Tongue]]. It views the [[Zolaen Gods]] as absolute in their power, and that all other forms of divinity are not truly holy.\n\nIt also views ancient people as sinful, most notably [[Humans]]. This sin is largely based around the idea that ancient people caused [[The Undoing]]. The defining characteristic of [[Arkian]] belief compared to other Zolaen-Centric belief is that the people of [[Zol]] are guilty of crimes so great and horrible, that the [[Zolaen Gods]] had to destroy the old world and birth it anew. Its scripture says the people of [[Zol]] must pay penance for the sins of their ancestors. It is why so much was lost, and why modern life is so dangerous and challenging. Only through overcoming the challenges of [[Zol]], and following [[The Watcher]]'s guidance can one find forgiveness. \n\n## Values\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The Trinity]] as an extension of [[The Watcher]]'s power\n- Atonement\n- Overcoming adversity\n- Purity\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[The Watcher]]\n\t- [[The Night Empress]]\n\t- [[The Lifeweaver]]\n\t- [[Yanneran]]\n\t- [[Tellab, the Wise]]\n\t- [[Giriam]]\n\t- [[Ayamot]]\n\t- [[Ohlit]]\n- Lesser [[Gods]] allied to the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[Bethar]]\n\t- [[Ellyon and Aradon]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Arkian]] scripture tells of [[The Watcher]] defeating [[Goh'zul]], then speaking [[The First Tongue]]. [[Arkian]] belief states that by speaking it in that moment, [[The Watcher]] created [[The First Tongue]]. Though this power he bound the other [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[The Trinity]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Arkian]] scripture teaches that ancient society was advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Arkian]] belief dictates that the [[Zolaen Gods]] enacted [[The Undoing]] as punishment to the people of [[Zol]] for heinous crimes.\n\n## Church Structure\n[[Arkian]] churches can manifest in one of two ways. The first being places of worship which are structured to worship all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] as a whole. These are called Octainiaries, after the eight gods. The second are places of worship structured to follow a specific member of the [[Zolaen Gods]], called Moniaries. The latter still pay respect to the pantheon as a whole, but they focus on the specific teachings and domain of a singular god.\n\nChurches may form as an individual organization, but often they are part of a larger collection of churches. Most commonly this is limited to the scope of a whole city, but sometimes they exceed that boundary.\n\nChurches are headed either an **Octavian Priest**, or a **Monian Priest** based on the type of church. Churches with a wider network are headed by **Zoltrum Octavian**, or a **Zoltrum Monian**. Beneath an Octavian or Monian Priest there are usually **High Priests**, and **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and being forgiven through devout worship to the [[Zolaen Gods]]. To a modernist, forgiveness is something that is easily obtained from [[The Watcher]] if it is sought out with honesty and humility. However, forgiveness is not held in perpetuity. One must live as a servant to the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief is similar to modernist belief in the sense that it focuses on the idea of inherited sin. However, fundamentalist belief tends to view the sin as far more abhorrent. Fundamentalists see themselves as pure, and above the \"scum\" of those who are sinful.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n[[Arkian]] worship is extremely widespread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]]. Most notably in the eastern kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n## Other Information\n- The specific nature of the crimes committed by the final generations of ancient peoples are not known. [[Arkian]] scripture mentions things like fraternizing with [[Gods]] other than the [[Zolaen Gods]], fraternizing with dark forces, attempting to surpass the [[Zolaen Gods]], and other things of similar heretical nature.\n- Sin is a widely debated topic within the scope of [[Arkian]] scripture. Though it it mostly associated with criminal activity, poor care of ones self/home/city, violence (that is unapproved by the church), wrath, promiscuity, over-indulgence, fraternization with [[Gods]] not approved by [[Arkian]] scripture, and things of the like. \n- [[Arkian]] worship is very similar to [[Dorian]] worship, however they differ in the sense that [[Arkian]] belief focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and atonement. [[Arkian]] belief sees the modern world as an opportunity for atonement. [[Dorian]] belief instead focuses on the idea of the modern world being a second chance at life. The two churches were once a single denomination, but diverged long ago. This divergence occurred before razing events like the [[Beast Ire]] Plague, and possibly even [[The Dragon War]]. The true nature of this divergence has been lost to time, and is largely debated.\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- The Temple of Doors, in the East of [[The Three Corners]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.665232851Z","tags":null},"/Artificers":{"title":"Artificers","content":"Magical crafters who bend the fundamental powers of [[Zol]] into their own creations.

This creation may manifest as a tool, pharmaceutical,  transportation, weapon, or defense.\n\nThe typical forms of artificery are:\n- Engineering - utilizing craftsmanship, natural materials, and mathematics to create technology.\n- [[Alchemy]] - utilizing magical and scientific techniques to break down, and re-combine substances to create something greater than the sum of their parts.\n- [[Iron Light]] - the most common craft. Iron utilizes simple runes formed into complex designs to leverage a user's [[Vizir]].\n- [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] - the most complicated and powerful form of artificery. It involves permanently imbuing an object with magic far beyond the power of [[Iron Light]]\nThese methods are frequently used together for superior results, but the resulting component is usually identified by the most difficult aspect of its making.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.669232871Z","tags":null},"/Ashian":{"title":"Ashian","content":"*In his hands he held the gift of three fires.

It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god. It also deifies [[Wordbearers]] as small [[Gods]].\n\nThe [[Ashian]] denomination is known for its worship of [[The Word of Fire]]. It is named after those who witnessed the snapping of [[The Word of Fire]], ash covered priests who witnessed the [[Wordbearer]] discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. The religion originally stemmed from [[Trinaism]]. Though through its close connection to [[The Word of Fire]], the denomination transformed rapidly, and broke off of [[Trinaism]].\n\n## Values\n- Sacrifice\n- Hierarchy\n- The Kingdom of [[Kapesh]]\n- [[Galliard Crown]]\n- [[Wordbearers]]\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- Fire\n- Order\n- Rebirth\n- Excellence\n- [[The Wills]]\n- [[Magic]]\n- Fate/Destiny\n- Prophecy\n- Divinity of the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[The Old Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n- [[Humans]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Trinity]]\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Ashian]] scripture believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[Ashian]] scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]], allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Ashian]] scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Ashian]] scripture views [[Humans]] as a sacrifice in the context of [[The Undoing]]. [[Ashian]] belief says that [[Humans]] fought alongside the [[Zolaen Gods]] against [[The Shroud of the Void]]. In the later stages of the battle, [[The Shroud of the Void]] began to take over the minds of [[Humans]]. So the [[Humans]] willingly gave up their [[Great Magic]], giving the [[Zolaen Gods]] the upper hand to seal the [[Void Gods]] away permanently within [[The Void]]. However, this was at a great cost. In an attempt to evade imprisonment, [[The Shroud of the Void]] used all of the power it had stolen from the [[Humans]] in an attempt to destroy [[The Watcher]]. [[The Shroud]] was unsuccessful in killing [[The Watcher]], but his destruction still caused [[The Undoing]].\n\n## Church Structure\nSimilar to [[Trinaism]], the [[Ashian]] church has a strict adherence to the idea of hierarchy. However, unlike [[Trinaism]], [[Ashian]] worship is not segmented into many smaller churches across [[The Three Corners]]. Instead, The [[Ashian]] church is a single organization, The [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\nAt the churches head exist two individuals. [[The Word of Fire]], and **The Grand Conflagrator**. [[The Word of Fire]] holds a unique role within the church. This is because he is seen as a piece of divinity himself. [[The Word of Fire]] does not lead the church in teachings, but instead exists as a messiah. [[The Word of Fire]] is seen as a royal, holy protector and a source of wisdom. [[The Word of Fire]] appoints a Grand Conflagrator. The Grand Conflagrator leads the whole of the [[Church of Three Fires]] in religious matters. The Grand Conflagrator is responsible for directing the teachings of the church, maintaining hierarchy, and resolving issues of faith.\n\nThe Grand Conflagrator leads the headquarters of the organization, The Cathedral of Three Fires in [[Stigmata]]. Beneath The Grand Conflagrator are **High Conflagrators** and **Conflagrators**. Individuals of these ranks are permitted to oversee churches of their own. Beneath them are **High Priests** and **Priests**.\n\nThe church also sees the [[Galliard Crown]], and the kingdom of [[Kapesh]] as holy.\n\n### Notable Organizations\n- The [[Church of Three Fires]]\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on worship and reverence of [[The Trinity]], [[The Wills]], [[The Word of Fire]], [[Galliard Crown]], and [[Kapesh]] as a whole. It views [[Humans]] as the brave sacrifice which saved the world from total antihalation. It is thought that only [[Humans]] can only restore their [[Great Magic]] through the church's wisdom. It also holds the belief that all things are intended, and that [[The Trinity]] will see [[Zol]] reach an age of glory once again, so long as its followers stay true.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief focuses on the ideals of sacrifice, hierarchy, and Human Sovereignty. It has a reputation of being the most brutal Trinity-Centric belief system within [[The Three Corners]]. Fundamentalist [[Arkian]] belief is is known for supporting one-sided societal structures like high nobility and [[Slavery]]. \n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[Stigmata]]\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Ashian]] belief supports [[Great Magic]] and the [[Triumvirate]].\n- [[Ashian]] belief is similar in many ways to Zolaen-Centric belief. However, it holds [[The Trinity]] above the [[Zolaen Gods]]. It also views\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- [[Church of Three Fires]] of [[Kapesh]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.669232871Z","tags":null},"/Attunement":{"title":"Attunement","content":"[[Attunement]] is the process by which an individual is able to use a magical object.

[[Audran]] was once the prosperous capital of [[Laenwalde]]. Seen by all of [[Zol]] as a beacon of light and wonder. So large you could not walk from end to end in a day, not counting getting lost or stopping. Its wonderous empire stood proud for many generations, until one of the darkest days in [[Zol]]'s history: The Day of Madness.\n\nThe Day of Madness was a sudden event that involved [[The Castle of Bodies]] suddenly attacking [[Audran]]. Until that point, no one even knew [[The Castle of Bodies]] existed. Its presence drove the vast majority of the city's people into a blood frenzy. People blindly fought, killed and destroyed anything they could. The whole event only lasted a short while, but wholly ruined the city and its people.\n\nThe capital was abandoned, but slowly over time people returned and sought refuge in its ruins. Disorganized and ramshackle rebuilding began. Eventually, the combined efforts of many created a new and unique place where the great city once stood. It would never become the capital again, but is now home to a very unique, rich, and diverse culture.\n\n![[audran.png]]\n\nOne part ruined, one part rebuilt, one part ramshackle slum. The city is fast paced crowded, overpopulated, exciting, dangerous, and full of opportunity.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city was re-founded by individuals who chose to make a new life in the ruins of what once was. It is a city by the people, and for the people. Despite the many attempts by the crown to instill order within [[Audran]], it remains chaotic and free. It is a place where anything, good or bad, can occur. |\n| Main Challenge | Governing the city is extremely difficult. Its ever-sprawling, overcrowded streets make a perfect environment for crime and chaos. Straying where one should not within [[Audran]] is very dangerous. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Cultivated Fruits, Farmed Goods, Flatbread and rice based meals |\n| Export | Investments, medicine, coffee, dyes, textiles, paper, books, and ink |\n| Size | Massive |\n| Outer Villages| Many |\n| City Leader | High Lord Beld Bordana |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | None |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | A massive lakeside city, textured with aged destruction that has been used as a foundation for new structure. |\n| Architecture | A ramshackle, half-destroyed city. New buildings of differing materials and styles have been erected using the ruins of the ancient destruction as foundations. Some buildings have a strange half old stone, half new lumber look. Others are entirely new, and many remain with entire sections missing. To accommodate the large population, tents and other makeshift structures can be found everywhere one can logically (and sometimes illogically) be placed. |\n| Color(s) | Purple, Grey, and Blue |\n| Symbolism | A tower with a window in the shape of an arched door |\n| Defenses | High walls |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The wealthy members of [[Audran]] society. However these nobles are not like nobility of other cities half made up of conventional nobles of good rapport, and half made up of eclectic individuals who made some great success in the city. These two types of nobles blend in court to create a fast paced, gossip-filled knot within society. |\n| Commoners | Social Class | The working class of the city. Poverty can move like waves through the fluid economy of the city. It is always a challenge for the common folk to keep their heads above water. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Individuals who could not keep up with, or getting a foot hold within the city's merciless environment. Many beggars exist within the city. Life is hard and competitive amongst this class. |\n| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |\n| Criminals | Criminal | A massive criminal network exists within the city. Many gangs, alliances, and rivalries fill the alleys of the city with violence and thievery. The underbelly of [[Audran]] is a world of its own, and must be traversed carefully. Its structure is nearly as complex and ever changing as its noble courts. Some of its major players are: The Roving Gang, The Tiefling Mafia, The Unruly, The Nakaza, and many more. |\n| Inquisitors | Law Enforcement | A class of highly trained individuals from [[The First Bastion]], sent to bring order to the city. These high ranking members of the city guard aim to clean up the streets and eliminate crime. However they have been at it for quite some time with little net change. |\n| Students | Academic Station | Students who attend [[Jhenbridge]], an academic institution of the [[Arcanum]], a branch of [[The University]]. These individuals are known to come from all backgrounds (usually low born) as [[Jhenbridge]] admits all students and does not charge tuition. |\n| Professors | Academic Station | Staff who teach at [[Jhenbridge]], an academic institution of the [[Arcanum]], a branch of [[The University]]. These individuals vary from practiced writers, to skilled and deadly [[Arcanists]]. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Castle Defiance | Keep | The city's main keep |\n| Audran Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n| Audran Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle. Located within the keep. |\n| Upper District | Inner-walled District | An inner walled section of the city that has been entirely restored. Home to the highest degree of nobility, shops, and taverns. |\n| [[Jhenbridge]] | College | An academic institution of [[The University]] that exists as the most well-known manifestation of the [[Arcanum]]. At this institution, anyone can obtain an education at no cost for their first year. However if they wish to have a long and fruitful academic career, they must perform well in their classes, and commit many hours of work to [[The University]]. Located in Charside. |\n| Pulp Markets | Market | A market frequented by students |\n| Port Squares | Market | The markets located closet to the lakeports |\n| Tent Alleys | Market | The many many markets located all over the city in narrow alleyways that sell things that would surprise even the [[Gods]]. |\n| The Upper Market | Market | The fine market located in the upper district |\n| Zalp's | Tavern | A tavern loved by many-a-student |\n| The Surviving Inn | Tavern | A tavern built in a structure that withstood The Day of Madness. Very beloved amongst commoners |\n| The Adorian | Tavern | A fine alehouse in the upper district where many skilled performers will attend |\n| Quiet Peter's | Tavern | A shady tavern located in the basement of a mostly ruined building in Catyard. Known as a sort of demilitarized zone amongst the local criminal groups where fighting of any sort is not allowed. |\n| The Dens | Tavern | A name for the many pop up tent based taverns one finds only in [[Audran]] |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is ruled by High Lord Beld Bordana. A young dwarven ruler who many feel is incompetent. He is charged with taming the untamable city of [[Audran]]. Luckily for him he has the Inquisitors at his disposal.\n\nThe crown does what it can to strike order within the city, but it is like herding cats. No matter the rules and efforts put into stilling the chaos, someone finds a way around it. Or if there isn't a way around it, they make one.\n\nIn some parts of the city, the criminals are as much of a ruling force as the crown, if not more. It does citizens well to keep their noses clean in regards to both parties.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn current day and age, the city is a massive place where anyone can slip away into. They will find some notch or corner they fit into within its wall. It may not be a good palace, but they will fit in somewhere.\n\n## Historical Importance\nOnce the beacon of prosperity within [[The Three Corners]], the city was struck with a horrible destruction during an event called The Day of Madness. \n\n*For more information on this please read the below section named: The Destruction of Audran - The Day of Madness*\n\n## The Destruction of Audran - The Day of Madness\nIn the late [[First Age]], [[Audran]] was the largest and most prosperous city in all of [[Zol]]. As the capital of [[Laenwalde]], it acted as a hub of commerce, politics, academia, and culture. This beacon of hope changed instantly when [[The Castle of Bodies]] suddenly appeared in the sky on The Day of Madness.\n\nBefore the event, none knew of [[The Castle of Bodies]]' existence. One of the strange [[Void Gods]], with a particular goal of random destruction.\n\nWhen it appeared, it blocked out the sun and exercised its influence on the minds of [[Audran]]'s people. Almost all who were exposed to it were immediately pushed to madness and violence. The city quickly became a bloody riot. Friend turned on friend as everyone within began to do all they could to destroy the city and its people.\n\nBrave heroes dispatched themselves as quickly as they could, luckily none of which were driven mad upon arrival, as it seemed the cognitive effect from the Void God was only exercised at its moment of arrival. They fought the Void God, as it dispatched an army of monstrous demons with horrific physiology from within its body.\n\nThe heroes did all they could to wound the strange being, in a manner similar to razing a city. Then without warning, the city vanished.\n\nThose who were driven mad by it suddenly regained their senses, but the damage had been done. In a matter of hours [[Audran]] was put to ruins. The memory of the event left the city with the brand of being cursed.\n\nThe vast majority left the city, and it remained a ghost town for generations. However, a fair portion of its buildings were reasonably intact. Eventually, the wounds turned to scars, people began to return to the city.\n\nOriginally only unorganized factions of bandits, forlorn, and nomads. As more people arrived a society naturally began to reform. After a few generations, the governing bodies of [[Laenwalde]] recognized it as a city once again.\n\nIt had been rebuilt to a degree. Fallen down sections of stone walls were rebuilt with lumber, rubble piles were stacked and reused as building material, and waterways were cleared of pollutants.\n\nLater research and divination revealed [[The Castle of Bodies]]' nature. The attack was deemed as a freak occurrence, and people began to call [[Audran]] home again. However it scars would never be forgotten and it was no longer the capital. [[Kahdinacht]] had taken its place as the defacto capital, and [[Heliodor]] would later be its successor.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- It has the largest city population within [[The Three Corners]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.674232897Z","tags":null},"/Automail":{"title":"Automail","content":"Automail is a unique form of [[Apparatum]] that is used to replace or enhance portions of an individual's body.

He spilled his own blood into the lakes and rivers of [[Zol]]. Those who drank of the waters were granted whispers of power, and strange dreams.\n\nSome did not notice, or even undergo the effects. Those who did felt a strong urge to follow their new bestial instincts, and abandon their societal bonds. It manifested as pulling sensation to the wilderness. Those who gave in abandoned their old lives to seek the source of this yearning.\n\nThey lived like primal people: hunting, scavenging, and howling under moonlight. The more they gave in, the more they grew in their strength. Bestial blood began to fill their veins. It increased their physical abilities, senses, and furthered the odd dreams.\n\n[[Kerndall]] meant for these people to be a legion of strong beings, true to his ways. By his ideals, they could defend themselves with no need for society and laws. Directly experiencing the wonder of nature day in, and day out.\n\nFor a time it was a sort of paradise for these people. The towns and cities they abandoned were left in shock and fear for their vanished loved ones, but it only created mass panic, rather than full blown pandemonium. Though it was not long before the habits of mortals began to reemerge in these bestial peoples.\n\nSome of the changed individuals sought more than the life of a simple beast, they hunted larger and larger prey. Eventually they began hunting each other, consuming them, and gaining much more of [[Kerndall]]'s essence through biomagnification. Their greed began to drive the transformation down a dark path. Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city's outskirts.\n\nEventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name [[Bloodhunters]], and the hunted were called [[Beastmen]]. The affliction itself was dubbed [[Beast Ire]], a [[Curiosity]].\n\nThe [[Beastmen]] were extremely powerful, and their minds had devolved to madness. It took warriors of equal strength and great determination to slay them. Many warriors began consuming small doses of blood from slain [[Beastmen]] to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over-usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of [[Beast Ire]].\n\nThe affliction was furthered by thralls of powerful [[Beastmen]]. Their power had grown so great, they could overpower the wills of weak mortals, and turn them into beast-like monstrosities that were loyal to them. The thrall's affliction was a strangely contagious thing and it spread quickly as viscous plague. \n\nThe exact method of transference was never determined, but over-exposure to beings that bore the affliction would occasionally cause individuals to succumb to the sickness. Bites and scratches from [[Beastmen]] seemed to accelerate this, however merely being in proximity to them for too long could cause it. The weaker one's will was, the more likely they would fall victim to the disease. Eventually the condition mutated enough to affect regular beasts as well. [[Bloodhunters]] that fought well seemed largely resistant to the transformation, however they were plagued by maddening thoughts. Academics debated about it being some bloodborne or airborne pathogen. Other's believed the method of transference was magical in nature.\n\n[[Bloodhunters]] who were interviewed by academics spoke of eldritch, nigh incomprehensible knowledge being revealed to them in dreams and visions. However they couldn't put the concepts to words efficiently. This sparked small academic branches, and churches who were obsessed with prospects of beast blood.\n\n[[Kerndall]] sought to stop the affliction, but it had taken on a life of its own. [[Zol]] was tainted by the plague, and the conflict between mortals and [[Beastmen]] had turned [[The Prime]] into a nightmarish world since [[Beast Ire]] had become contagious. As the crisis progressed, the people of [[Zol]] went into hiding. As the [[Curiosity]] spread into the cities. The only solace that the mortal world had, was sunlight. [[Beastmen]] feared the light of day, and only stalked during the night.\n\n## Symptoms\nThe symptoms of [[Beast Ire]]:\n- The earliest symptoms are typically nightmares and a feeling of power\n- Increased strength, constitution and speed\n- Heightened senses\n- Extreme hunger\n- Aversion of water and sunlight\n- Obsession with lanternlight\n- Madness\n- In its most advanced state, the afflicted will develop any number of beast like traits\n\t- Fur, scales, amphibian traits, insectoid traits, or feathers\n\t- Glowing eyes\n\t- Sharp teeth\n\t- Horns or antlers\n\t- Claws or hooves\n\t- Elongated limbs\n\t- Quadrupedal mobility\n\t- Extra limbs\n\t- Increase size\n\t\t- Some rare cases an afflicted will be over 15 meters in length\n\t- In its most powerful state, beings will take on a nightmarish appearance. Long strange hair, many eyes, dark tendrils, exposed bone and viscera, an aura of madness, and unique magical abilities are just some examples of what powerful [[Beastmen]] manifest.\n\n## Societal Impact\n- The people of [[Zol]] had to hide in their homes save for hours around midday when the sun was at its most intense.\n- Proximity to the afflicted caused nightmares which haunted the population, and supposedly turned them to thralls on occasion.\n- Many brave individuals had to become [[Bloodhunters]] to defend the cities and cull the numbers of [[Beastmen]]\n- Some [[Beastmen]] became so powerful they gained worshippers\n- Some cities fell completely and were left to ruin. Others only fell for a time like [[Little Triumph]], [[Zessgorn]] or [[Reach Run]]\n- Races of beings who already bore beast-like traits faces great discrimination during these times. They segregated, exiled, and even executed for their beast-like heritage. These races were:\n\t- [[Harengon]]\n\t- [[Tabaxi]]\n\t- [[Aarakocra]]\n\t- [[Owlin]]\n\t- [[Kenku]]\n\t- [[Grung]]\n\t- [[Triton]]\n\n## Resolution\n[[Bloodhunters]] were able to kill off all of the known powerful [[Beastmen]] after years of vigorous labor. However the affliction was still present as thralls roamed [[Zol]]. It was thought that [[Zol]] would never be rid of [[Beast Ire]]. But one day the spread seemed to halt. Druids later discovered that [[Kerndall]] had struck a deal with [[The Wasp Eater]]. [[The Wasp Eater]] had seemingly played a hand in the plagues contagious nature, and had bested [[Kerndall]]. Their deal would have the remaining affliction transferred into [[Kerndall]]'s body, and the spread would cease. [[Kerndall]] would then become the servant of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] was maddened by the affliction, and was dubbed [[Kerndall, the Feral King]]. His son [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] took his throne. Slowly, [[Zol]] began to return to normalcy.\n\nSome of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed and prospects of beast blood. They instead hid in remote locations, maintaining [[Kerndall]]'s original ideals. After the resolution of [[Beast Ire]], they were granted new forms by [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]]. A cast of peoples now known as the [[Beastfolk]].\n\nIt is thought that [[Beast Ire]] is a dark thing of the past, however some believe that powerful [[Beastmen]] are still out there.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.675232902Z","tags":null},"/Beastfolk":{"title":"Beastfolk","content":"*The descendants of those untempted by the [[Beast Ire]]*\n![[Beastfolk.png]]\n\n## Description\nThe [[Beast Ire]] plague began as boons of power from [[Kerndall]]. However the lust for power that burdened many mortals turned it into a corrupting force of darkness. However not all succumbed to the temptations of power. Those who stayed true to themselves became [[Beastfolk]] when the [[Beast Ire]] plague was overcome.\n\n[[Beastfolk]] are a very diverse cast of people who share traits with beasts. Some beast folk appear very animal-like, called *Full-Bloods*. While others appear more akin to the more ordinary races of [[Zol]] (dwarves, elves, humans, halflings, et cetera) and can change their form to be more animal like at will. These are called *Shifters*. The range of these bestial forms is very broad. Given compatible sexual characteristics, [[Beastfolk]] can mate with an person. The resulting offspring will also be a [[Beastfolk]] of one of the parents bestial heritages. The chance of it being a full-blood or a shifter is fifty-fifty.\n\nSome of the known bestial heritages are:\n- Canine\n- Ursidae\n- Cervidae\n- Reptilian\n- Rodent\n- Et Cetera\n\nOften the name [[Beastfolk]] will be adapted to better fit the charactristics of an individual such as: Ratfolk, Bearfolk, et cetera.\n\nThere is however a common confusion that causes much discourse in [[Zol]]. [[Beastfolk]] are a product of [[Speciatum Magica]], the product of magical happenstance that produces a whole race of beings. Before [[Beastfolk]] came to exist, many other animal like beings existed. These races now get commonly referred to as [[Beastfolk]], but are in fact physiologically, culturally, and historically different from [[Beastfolk]]. These [[Races]] are:\n- [[Harengon]]\n- [[Tabaxi]]\n- [[Aarakocra]]\n- [[Owlin]]\n- [[Kenku]]\n- [[Grung]]\n- [[Triton]]\nSome [[Beastfolk]] may even bear forms that appear similar to one of these races. However they are still biologically different.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 80-100 years |\n| Height | Varies widely based on bestial heritage |\n| Significant Locations | [[The Witchlands]] |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Beastfolk]] are often called [[Beastmen]] by ignorant, or racist individuals. This is a term of great offence to them. [[Beastmen]] were the monstrous evil that created the [[Beast Ire]] plague. [[Beastfolk]] are the descendants of the brave, and stalwart individuals who did not give into a lust for power.

Few churches exist to Bethar in comparison to many other gods, and those that do are humble in their scale. \n\nCommunion with Bethar usually takes place whilst performing an act of craftsmanship.  This act itself is usually seen as the equivalent of worship or prayer.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.677232912Z","tags":null},"/Bloodhunters":{"title":"Bloodhunters","content":"See [[Beast Ire]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.682232937Z","tags":null},"/Brass-Taldora":{"title":"Brass Taldora","content":"See [[Ryze]] or [[The Brass Hall]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.682232937Z","tags":null},"/Cadence":{"title":"Cadence","content":"*Wandering God, Moral of Adaptability*\n![[Cadence 2.png]]\n\nHe who is known by Manu Modica, Clausula, Cade, Ence, and Mao Leve. Known by many names and many forms, [[Cadence]] is the Wandering God of Adaptability. An ever-bending, forever-changing miasma that seeks harmony for the world.\n\n## Depiction\n[[Cadence]] is said to create a form for himself from the environment. A constellation of stars and a nimbus of clouds bending to appear as a leporine being. Distant hill top trees aligning to rabbit ears that perk up upon your notice. Steam rising over a pot of soup amalgamating to form his celestial silhouette.\n\nWhen not tampering with the manifestation of the physical world, [[Cadence]] appears similarly to a [[Harengon]]. His body has an ancient yet powerful appearance, but his face maintains a youthful appearance.\n\n## Moral\n[[Cadence]] teaches the Moral of Adaptability. At its core, this ideal teaches one to seek harmony with all things through acceptance of any given circumstance. Stretching ones limit to not only seek survival, but prosperity. Overcoming obstacles by redefining what an obstacle is.\n\n## Associations\n[[Cadence]] is associated with:\n- Music\n- Culinary Arts\n- Pirates\n- [[Harengon]]\n- Mischeif\n\n## Realm\nWhen travelling into [[Cadence]]'s reaches of [[The Unknown Realm]], the ground gives way to a strange cosmic space. Moving in this space is akin to swimming in air. \n\nThe area is jumble of strange but enticing objects floating in the odd vacuum as far as the eye can see. Food, instruments, statues, works of art, books, furniture, even entire buildings constructed with *Non-Euclidean Geometry* bob about the air.\n\n[[Cadence]] is said to spend his time here crafting these oddities. Academics are not sure as to why he would do this, and largely assume it is for his own enjoyment.\n\n## Behavior\nTo the uneducated eye, [[Cadence]]'s behavior seems erratic and even chaotic at times. He is known to be a trickster who throws mortals into strange situations. His behavior may turn on a dime between generous or demanding.\n\nFollowers of [[Cadence]] claim that is is done to *challenge* mortals. it is thought that putting the world in a place where unexpected, but great things can occur sews seeds for Adaptability.\n\nThe scripture and beliefs around [[Cadence]] make him the most dramatic of [[The Wandering Gods]]. This increased drama can be seen in the demeanor of his followers.\n\n## Worshipers\nCadence's followers are known to be erratic, but endearing. They follow his example, and never let the world predict their next move. They set about the [[Zol]], ever-chaotic, looking to find the most unexpected ways they can serve the greater good.\n\nSome call these folk *Yes-men* (the only named group of followers that worship [[The Wandering Gods]]). They are known to do random acts like leaving a baked pie on someone's doorstep, or completing unfinished construction projects overnight. Once a group of Yes-Men in [[Arcadia]] shredded every ledger of tax collector in broad daylight, then turned themselves in to law enforcement.\n\nYes-Men organize themselves in regular secret meetings called *The Determining* where goals are set foreword and decided upon by the Yes-Men. These set goals may involve small local projects or large pilgrimages.\n\nYes-Men are proselytizers, always sharing the word of Cadence in the most unexpected manner. Skeptics see them as ne'er-do-wells seeking to disrupt the balance of their preferred systems, while others think they are kind hearted oddities who bring good luck wherever they go.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.683232942Z","tags":null},"/Calendar":{"title":"Calendar","content":"A calendar year in [[Zol]] is defined by 4 seasons, each 100 days long, with days being 24 hours.

This uniqueness has brought them many gifts, but equally as many challenges. [[Changelings]] look similar to elves, with stark white hair, skin and dark eyes. However they are not bound by this appearance. They may choose to adapt their form to any other form of their choosing, given it is of similar relative height and mass to their own body. This means they can appear as any person they choose, allowing them to create perfect disguises. Alternatively they can take a form entirely of their own creation, making their skin look like it was formed of moving crystal, and their hair of spun gold.\n\nAn individual changeling has much control over their identity. They can even willingly control their sexual characteristics. Their culture has adapted around this and two forms exist as ones identity:\n- Pure Form - The way one looks upon birth, the characteristic white hair and skin of [[Changelings]]. This form is a personal and sacred thing\n- True Form - A form that exists as an expression of self. It is designed by [[Changelings]] in their youth and is the form [[Changelings]] express for the majority of their lives. A True Form does not look like a typical body. An individual may make themselves look as if their skin was made of carved and stained wood, painted porcelain, and anything one can feasibly imagine.\n\n[[Changelings]] live almost exclusively within their own remote northern kingdom of [[The Glassius Reach]], where they worshiped powerful objects called [[The Oldshards]]. When the outside world learned of their ability to do this, fear an worry filled their minds. Non-changelings began to worry their neighbors had been replaced with [[Changelings]], sent to steal from them, or worse. The mystery and fear surrounding them eventually spiraled into the [[Western War]], a war that cost [[The Glassius Reach]] many losses. The greatest lost was that of one of [[The Oldshards]], [[The Apex]].\n\nThe loss of [[The Apex]] has not only caused religious and cultural trauma, but biological trauma as well. In modern day, 1 in 100 changelings born of [[Yorn et Gaul]] do not posses the ability to alter their body, locking them in their Pure Form. These [[Changelings]] are often referred to as *still*, and many see them as outcasts or freaks. The life of a still changeling is a very difficult one as most feel as if they have no place in [[Zol]].\n\nThis war was so damaging to [[Changelings]], it has politically divided them from the rest of the outside world, save for the occasional merchant relationship with [[The Ward]]. [[Changelings]] would not find themselves welcomed in most cities. Luckily for them, most can present themselves in any way they choose.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | 80-100 years |\n| Height | 5'5-7' |\n| Significant Locations | [[The Glassius Reach]] |\n\n## Additional Info\n- The way [[Changelings]] adapt their form is not an [[Illusion]], but an actual [[Transmutation]] of their bodies. These changes take time to adopt (usually a few minutes), depending on the skill of the changeling\n- Those who believe in [[Great Magic]] think [[Changelings]] hold the aspect of ancient [[Humans]] that caused them to commit the ultimate sin which sparked [[The Undoing]]. It is said by these individuals that [[Changelings]] hold ancient human's deception.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.689232973Z","tags":null},"/Chorn":{"title":"Chorn","content":"*Wandering God, Moral of Patience*\n![[Chorn.png]]\n\nAll things that have occurred, and will occur are the products of seeds sewn in time.

[[Chronomancy]] allows one to move backwards, foreword, or even stop time. In all instances movement along this dimension is directly proportional to the users skill. To make things more achievable some users will attempt to send only their perspective elsewhere, allowing them to acquire information while risking much less.\n\nThis magic is used with the intention of keeping one's mind continuous, while the timestream is broken. This makes it very difficult to perform. Failures can be cataclysmic, or relatively harmless. In terms of harmless failure, you could go backwards in time, but lose all your memory of doing so effectively accomplishing nothing. Alternatively one could freeze time but also freeze themselves in the process immediately ending the spell, uselessly expending great deals of energy.\n\nMore plausibly, things will end up worse. A paradox could be created and cause the timeline to lash. A lashing timeline could manifest as something simple like dozens of surges of wild magic, summoning horrible beasts from the cosmos, or create tears in the planes. They could also manifest as something worse like mile long tendrils of raw energy tearing through the environment, or removing the caster existence entirely.\n\nBecause of these high stakes, divine beings, such as [[Kaszu]], are known to intervene and punish those responsible. Academia holds very little knowledge about [[Chronomancy]] for all of these reasons. Only the mad pursue this practice.\n\n## The Chronomantic Wall\n[[Chronomancy]] is a relatively unexplored field due to the dangers involved.

It is done by moving the space from one location to another. It can be used to make a room much larger or smaller.

A room made smaller will have furniture, shrink, restyle or disappear to accommodate. A forest expanded will have plants emerge from the ground instantly in the newly opened expanse.

It is magic that involves folding space for the purposes of teleportation, or bringing creatures and objects to, or away from a [[Caster]]. These usages of magic can span great distances, or even cross borders between [[Planes]]. It requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.\n\nUsers of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying. Evidence shows this to be some product of [[The Mortal Coil]], but scholars frequently debate this.\n\n## Teleportation\nTeleportation is an extremely valuable skill to the society of [[Zol]]. It costs a great amount of gold to hire a [[Caster]] for teleportation. Teleportation is the fastest method to move about [[Zol]], but it does pose a unique set of risks.\n\nBefore [[The Iron Tracks]], teleportation was the only consistent and safe way to get from once city to another. Making it only accessible to the rich or powerful [[Caster]]s. Maximum teleportation distance is determined by skill, most who are capable of it can move themselves anywhere within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. \n\nThis limit on teleportation does make it ineffective for long distance expeditions into places like [[The Vast Sea]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. One may argue that you could teleport very far, rest, then teleport again. This strategy however is unfortunately ineffective.\n\nTeleportation is based on familiarity of the current location, and the destination. The less familiar you are with either of these, the more dangerous the operation. If you are intending of teleporting one thousand miles east, you may end up one thousand feet into solid ground if you are not careful.\n\nThere are methods of mitigating and even completely removing these risks of teleportation. [[Teleportation Circles]] can be constructed and used as origin points or destinations when travelling. These circles take a long time to create. They are highly commodified pillars in society, and well guarded by their owners. They are commonly referred to as Convergences.\n\n## Dangers of Teleportation\nAs mentioned, one may end up teleporting to somewhere they do not intend if they are unskilled, or unfamiliar with the destination. However, the risks of teleportation do not end there. It is possible for others to tamper with an individuals teleportation attempt. An individual skilled with [[Divination]] can usually tell information about where a person has teleported from, or where they went.\n\nSome dangerous [[Caster]]s can even lay traps called *Mage Snares* that can change a teleportation's destination without the original caster knowing. This makes teleportation very dangerous for high profile individuals.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.690232978Z","tags":null},"/Corinth":{"title":"Corinth","content":"*The Unmarred Changeling City, home to one of [[The Oldshards]]*\n![[Corinth Skyline.png]]\n\nA towering city of sleek black stone, and sharply accented structures.

This level of control is managed through policing, political debates, bureaucratic process, public forums and things of the like.

All people of the city from ages 8-15 participate in learning at [[The Eelynn]]. The school provides many levels of education, and is a repository of some of [[Zol]]'s most obscure knowledge due to its influences, and removal from the rest of the world. Some members of [[The Eelynn]] are rumored to be tasked with making long pilgrimages to distant lands, bearing changeling disguise, to return with knowledge not yet possessed by [[The Eelynn]].

Every citizen of [[Corinth]] studies here for at least some part of their youth, and some even go further to become full fledged members. These members go on to study magic, philosophy, and various other branches of academia. All of this study is viewed through the lens of [[The Oldshards]], and the world's relationship to the relics.                                                                      |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is ruled by Shardcaller Osieur Xetac, an extremely well respected leader of advanced age. Osieur is a very wise ruler and has maintained the order of [[Corinth]] for many years. The Shardcaller of [[Corinth]] has a formidable army at their command, and has secured the region well in the years after the [[Western War]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Glassian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, the city is viewed by foreigners as a city of evil and deception. There is no race that faces more stigma than [[Changelings]]. Many outsiders believe them to be deceptive monsters who will wear the faces of your friends, steal your gold, and eat your young. In reality, this is a result of propaganda and fear of the unknown. While Changeling society is much different from many foreign cities, they are not evil by nature.\n\nSince [[Yorn et Gaul]] was gravely damaged in the [[Western War]], [[Corinth]] is seen as the last true Changeling city. It is also the only place that possesses one of [[The Oldshards]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nIn the past, [[Corinth]] sat comfortably separated from the rest of [[Zol]]. The city's existence was known by the outer kingdoms, but they kept their distance. This peaceful privacy only lasted until evidence of changeling spies interfering with the western kingdoms of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] was discovered. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims of interference, but the chain of events led to the [[Western War]].\n\nThe war never fully reached [[Corinth]], and only its sister city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] was damaged.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Most outsiders that come to the city are merchants from [[The Ward]] who make long treks to reach [[The Glassius Reach]]. These traders have respectful relationships with [[Changelings]] and are allowed to come and go from the city.\n- The city does utilize [[Apparatum]], however its disconnection from the outside world has made it difficult for [[The Glassius Reach]] to keep up with the advancements in technique and skills involved in the [[Artificers]] practice.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.692232988Z","tags":null},"/Curiosity":{"title":"Curiosity","content":"Curiosities are afflictions caused by the influence of magic.

Those who take a stance against [[Daetro]]'s rule are cast out or pursued by his envoys.\n\nDespite the similarity in domain, [[Daetro]] has a particular distaste for the [[Church of Three Fires]], and the beliefs around it.

Still seeking to fulfil their original quest, their Ire now threatens [[The Prime]] as it is formed from what remains of their original nemesis. One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence.* \n\nThe land of the dead, and the punishment of [[Zol]]. [[Damnation]] is a subplane to [[The Void]] and home to [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] along with his legion of [[Fiends]].\n \n![[Damnation.png]]\n\n[[Damnation]] is divided into an unknown amount of layers. The known structure of [[Damnation]] is largely gained from reports given by the rare resurrected dead who were able to recall pieces of their time there, and Academics who have utilized magic to divine information about the horrifying place.\n\nDamnation is home to [[Fiends]], and the souls of the dead. These beings exist in all over Damnation in many different environments, all ruled by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]].\n\n## Apolyatum, The City of The Dead\nThe resting place for souls not fit for punishment. It is the highest layer of [[Damnation]]. Manifesting as a vast city in a colossal cavern. An ever present grey fog looms overheard. The fog sheds a faint yellow light when it nears the ground providing the only natural illumination in Apolyatum.\n\n![[Apolyatum.png]]\n\nMortal souls placed here are all given a very similar, grey toned, physically healthy body that echoes their appearance from the middle point of their lives.\n\nAll are given a chance at making a comfortable, eternal life in Apolyatum. Everyone arrives in the city with 3 stone coins and simple clothing.\n\nHere they can live lives similar to that of the mortal world. Making friends, eating food, and experiencing niceties. They also face class discrimination, brutality, and other inconveniences similar to life.\n\nMany odd jobs unique to Apolyatum are available to the souls here, but mostly consist of excavating the cave walls, constructing new homes, and agriculture.\n\nA group of [[Fiends]] known as *The Regal* act as the nobility and policing force of Apolyatum. Many souls spend their days serving them, but some successful souls rise to noble ranks as well.\n\n## The Tomb of Stone\nThe maze of pain. A seemingly endless labyrinth of punishment and monsters. Souls guilty of crimes not quite worthy of eternal punishment are sent here.\n\n![[The Tomb of Stone.png]]\n\nIndestructible monoliths are scattered all over the maze. Glowing with faint green marks that house the souls of those who trapped within the labyrinth.\n\nBeings sent to the labyrinth are forced to play in a horrible, endless game. They wake up in bodies at the base of the strange monoliths, with the knowledge that there are exits at the far reaches of the labyrinth that lead away from the Tomb.\n\nTo reach them, the must make their way through the dangerous maze filled with torturous traps, mechanical monsters, and fiendish abominations. When the damned are inevitably killed within the Tomb of Stone, they wake up in a new body at the base of a monolith, rather than facing the effects of [[The Mortal Coil]]. It is not known how this works, but it is assumed that the bodies used by the punished are not their true form which is instead held within the monoliths.\n\nThis creates a society of beings who live in constant fear. Always running, hiding, fighting, and dying. Factions of these people rise and fall, and even social or political hierarchies form.\n\nSouls are made to reside here for a unknown amount of years based on their punishment. They are only allowed to leave once their sentence is complete, or they make it to one of the impossibly far doors leading to other layers of [[Damnation]].\n\n## Zaereza\nOnly two things are known about Zaereza. It is a vast and expansive collection Damnation's layers, one of which contains the palace of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is also the grounds upon which souls are punished for an eternity.\n\n![[Zaereza.png]]\n\nIt is likely full of many distinct layers all with their own properties. However, the details of this remain unknown to the mortal world.\n\n## Obliteration\nWhere souls, too dangerous and horrible, are sent for destruction.\n\n![[Obliteration.png]]\n\nThe lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. Obliteration is an infrequently used tool, possessed by [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. A place so grim and terrifying, its existence was once thought to be an impossibility.\n\nObliteration is completely devoid of color, and contains unnamed titans that wield colossal tools used to destroy souls.\n\nIt is not known why [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] destroys dangerous souls.

Known for selling rare magical objects and a wide plethora of [[Apparatum]]. |\n | Three Springs | Residential | A large swathe of rental properties mostly populated by students. |\n | Slot Alley | Market | A nexus of narrow alleyways filled with shops and taverns. |\n | The Rablavan | Tavern | The drinking establishment most popular with the students. Known for being very rowdy. |\n | Ostilles' | Tavern | A quiet cousin to The Rablavan. Frequented by students and professors who look to share drinks and conversations of magic, history, and philosophy. |\n | The Hidden Nook | Tavern | A dark and dingy tavern that the far end of Clay Crest. Known for being a place where you can hire the services of one of the Discredited. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city itself is governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] Lady Zed Dion, a very efficient and beautiful elf woman. Lady Dion is well liked by both the city and the academy as she manages the chaos that a population largely made up of foreign, magical students can bring.\n\nThe academy itself has its own rules and restrictions, and is overseen by The Arch Mages and The Magnate. The city and the academy work in harmony to keep a careful balance between the two entities. This functions well for the most part, but there are the occasional conflicts that vary in intensity.\n\nThe city is well protected by its garrison and vast magical resources.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws. Note that any crime already existing within the [[Alderian Laws]] that could are committed more efficiently via the usage of magic (assault, thievery, detrimental [[Necromancy]], etc.) are punished with a much higher severity than the other free cities.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Discredited Services | High | Those discredited by the academy are not allowed to sell their magical services, nor are individuals allowed to hire them. |\n| Restricted Production of Apparatum | Medium/High | Those who produce [[Apparatum]] of categories deemed dangerous by the academy without documented permission are punished. |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the current day and age, [[Deepspell]] is known to create the best [[Apparatum]] in all of eastern [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city is extremely hard to take by siege due to its location and mages. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]] the city was only able to be taken by rebels because of students within the school that sympathized with their cause.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Many conspiracy theories exist about the academy. Some of which have truth to them:\n\t- The towers of the university reach up far beyond what you see from the outside. Containing 'pocket dimensions' that only the high ranking members of the school can reach\n\t- The academy is secretly connected to [[The Kybis Assembly]]'s campus in [[Archaic]] via underground tunnels that travel through [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]].\n- The academy has a long standing rivalry with [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.699233023Z","tags":null},"/Demodemacht":{"title":"Demodemacht","content":"![[Demodemacht.png]]\n\nThe grandest mountain range in [[The Three Corners]]. [[Demodemacht]]'s perilous peaks are the largest in all the realm. Their grandeur is the setting for many-a-tale in the eastern culture. Known for its unique and treacherous terrain, including narrow passageways, complex caves, steep cliffs, and deep canyons. The range is also home to a variety of powerful creatures, including massive birds the size of houses, [[Giants]], griffins, and of course [[Dragons]]. The peaks of [[Demodemacht]] are said to be so high that they touch [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]].\n\nSome say the range is also home to a powerful and ancient order of monks who reside in secluded monasteries on the peaks. They are said to possess great wisdom and spiritual power, and are rumored to be able to control the world around them through physical power and mental fortitude.\n\nThere is no end to the folk lore around [[Demodemacht]]. Claims of it being the resting place of [[The Trinity]] itself, or it being a battleground for the [[Gods]]. Tales of crystals found deep within its caves that can grant immortality, or parables about a hidden valley, deep within the range, where a sleeping, forgotten god is said to dwell. Much of this is likely the prattling of common folk, but some of it may be based in truth.\n\nIt is also home to many odd and powerful individuals who reside within [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Location\nThe range extends across:\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.699233023Z","tags":null},"/Demons":{"title":"Demons","content":"The unknown horrors of [[The Void]].

They hope to return [[Zol]] to the once chaotic and deconstructed state of The [[Sea of Monsters]].\n\n[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.700233029Z","tags":null},"/Diaphanous-Magic":{"title":"Diaphanous Magic","content":"An informational [[Energy]] signature given off by very basic magic.

Famed for its finely made firearms, and infamous for its crime. [[Diddan]] faces constant challenges of roving gangs, draught, and corrupt leadership. The city is not a hospitable one, but it has a unique feeling of undeniable freedom that is hard for some to resist.\n\n![[diddan.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Main Opportunity         | [[Diddan]] is a city founded by those who fled normal society to create a place of their own, where the influence of outside politics and law would not have the draining grasp it has on so much of [[Zol]]. Where the ideals of The Badlands could continue to thrive. Here, infamous rouges called *Cowboys* posses agency not bound by the crown's will. |\n| Main Challenge           | A place once founded as an escape from society has become a society of its own.

The surrounding sands contain trace metals which can be used for creating all manner of ranged weaponry. Some are simple, such as rifles that do not jam. Others are intricate and magical, firing rounds that can go around corners or release an explosion on impact. Many [[Artificers]] and craftspeople attempt to make facsimiles of these, some are non-magical mechanical guns, others are reasonably well made artillery. However no place within [[The Three Corners]] possesses such a collection of fine ranged weaponry as [[Diddan]]. |\n| Sifter               | Occupation   | Prospectors who use special equipment to sift rare metals used by [[Artificers]] out of the local sands. Typically done by the poorest members of the city. A weeks worth of work may only fill the bottom of a small vial with a given metal. The act of sifting was originally done with naturally occurring magnetic Lodestones that drew in specific metals, but has since progressed to using specifically designed [[Apparatum]] to accomplish the same task. The metals found are typically used by local gunsmiths or exported to distant [[Artificers]] at very steep prices.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Lawmen               | Occupation   | Local enforcers of the law, usually equipped with firearms. These individuals are charged with upholding the crowns will. While they do a reasonable amount of this, locals know them to be more concerned with filling their pockets by catering to the whims of the Gentry and corrupt throne within the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Cowboys              | Outlaw       | Local criminals, known to be equipped with firearms.

However it is famed for the quality of its exported firearms and rare metals.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Diddan]] is thought to be the cumulation of all old and near-lost cultures from The Badlands, the era before the found of the three kingdoms of [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Surrounding the city are many tiny communities that are under the jurisdiction of [[Diddan]], they typically consist of a few homes, farms, businesses, a general goods store, and a saloon. The names of these communities are:\n\t- Larshen\n\t- Dont\n\t- Blackwater\n\t- Pitts\n\t- Cryde\n\t- Mendin\n\t- Brackettsford\n\t- Quarry Sound\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.705233054Z","tags":null},"/Dimeritium":{"title":"Dimeritium","content":"See [[Magical Metals]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.705233054Z","tags":null},"/Disclaimer":{"title":"Disclaimer","content":"This is a fantasy world I originally created for hobbyist purposes. Primarily as a TTRPG campaign setting.\n\nThings to note:\n- I require that everyone who wants to use [[Zol]] for their own purposes credit me in their project. To acquire Zol for usage in for-profit scenarios, please contact me.\n- The main concept I wanted to play with when writing the world of [[Zol]] is *agency*. For a common person in [[Zol]], life is very dangerous. There are many forces, gods, monsters, and people who are much more powerful than the average individual. For most people, the main obstacle in their life is to achieve some sort of agency so they can make a life for themselves. This is a great challenge in [[Zol]] as the world is extremely dangerous. Even if one is able to overcome threats of death, there are many political and social challenges as well.\n- This collection of information was written as if it was from the perspective of an academic within [[Zol]]. With a few tid-bits of information added that would not necessarily be known by the people of [[Zol]] for the sake of storytelling/explanation. This means that almost all of the information in here could be known by an extremely smart person within the world.\n- There are gaps intentionally left for the sake of speculation, expansion, and creative addition for anyone using this for their own purposes (Ex: TTRPGs).\n- The world is provided in a way where there are many locations, characters, historical accounts, and other things of the like, however it is not meant to give one everything that they would need for something like a TTRPG campaign. [[Zol]] is meant to be added to beyond that of the material here. If I were going to write a TTRPG campaign in [[Zol]], I would create 70-80% of the things that are going to go within it and use this as a skeleton for the story.\n- There are some more controversial topics within [[Zol]]. I have included them to explore stories around overcoming these issues. **For someone using [[Zol]] for their own purposes, you do not have to include any of these. The are not integral to the core of [[Zol]] and are to be seen as narrative tools rather than a foundation.**\n\t- In [[Zol]] there is no transgender or sexual discriminations of any kind in its cultural history. However there is the inclusion of:\n\t\t- racial (in the context of [[Zol]], [[Races]] are fictional species of humanoids. It is not based on skin color, or other physical traits) and religious discrimination. This is done for narrative device only. The discrimination is between fictional species of humanoid races and fictional religions and is not based on things like hair, skin, eyes, or anything else that would reflect a more real-world scenario. **In the case of [[Zol]] if there is a racist character, or one who would suppress religious freedoms, they are ALWAYS meant to be an antagonist**. There are no exceptions. \n\t\t- There is little-to-no gender discrimination. I originally had the idea of no gender discrimination, but I had changed my mind on this after a good deal of thinking. It is included because I think stories of people overcoming these societal barriers are really important (Not that the stories of people overcoming the issues I have intentionally excluded aren't, I just didn't feel educated enough yet on those topics to include them in this way). I hope to tell similar ones within this world. The extent of the social issues regarding this topic would be things like: a specific gender identity being expected to act a certain way, or a career/field of study being dominated by one gender. It does not include things like the systematic oppression, or other great mistreatments of one gender. Again, anyone who would suppress one's freedoms or act in a sexist manner is always meant to be an antagonist, there are no exceptions.\n\t- There is also [[Slavery]] within [[Zol]]. It is meant to be viewed within the same lens as other injustices included, where slave owners, or other characters who perpetuate [[Slavery]] are **always** to be considered villains. The inclusion of such an inhumane practice is done with the intention of highlighting the vast differences of agency individuals have in [[Zol]], and provide challenges for the characters of the stories to overcome.\n\t- There are allusions to modern day Christianity with topics like [[The Trinity]] being a major part of [[Zol]]. I personally am an atheist who grew up in a Christian household. I used the religious frameworks I was exposed to as a child to create a world where characters can explore the concept of agency and religion in a way where I felt like I could do it justice. There are parts of [[Zol]] that may seem very pro-religion or anti-religion. I am in no way aiming to make a blanket statement of the rightness or wrongness of modern day Christianity with [[Zol]]. I personally aim to illustrate the wrongness of suppression of personal freedoms or beliefs through religion, specifically in a way I am familiar with.\n\t- No people groups within [[Zol]] are meant to represent real-world people groups. Any connection is coincidental.\n\t\t- One thing that I have included in the world that has cultural significance outside of this piece of fiction is [[The Tarot]]. A tradition of reading tarot cards to divine information about the future. My reasoning for this inclusion is I have experienced many TTRPG players wanting to explore this concept. My efforts here were to create a unrelated history of tarot so that its connections to European traditions would not be carelessly appropriated. This was done with the hopes that anyone utilizing the setting who wished to include this concept didn't have to base it on real-world cultures if they did not have good reason to. In short, this fictional representation was meant to honor it rather than appropriate it.\n\t- No events within the world are supposed to be representations of real-world events. Any connection is coincidental.\n- To create many of the image assets of the site I used Midjourney AI. I personally feel that the usage of AI to replace artists is a bad thing, however for a project of this nature I decided to use it. This is a 100% hobbyist, and I would never want to use AI art for profit. The time investment for me to create my own art for this would have made the vision I had for it impossible.\n- There are some things in the [[Zol]] which are directly based on other pieces of media. This is because I enjoy running my Dungeons and Dragons sessions with parallels to the stories me and my friends enjoy. Some examples of this are: The [[Greatwinds]] and The Highstorms of The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson, and the [[Beast Ire]] plague and Bloodborne. This isn't done with the intention to steal from other creators, but instead create an environment where my Dungeons and Dragons party can explore elements of other pieces of fiction we enjoy.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.705233054Z","tags":null},"/Dislimn":{"title":"Dislimn","content":"see the [[Fell]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.708233069Z","tags":null},"/Divination":{"title":"Divination","content":"[[Divination]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

There are many interpretations of the cause of the event. Regardless of personal belief [[Dorian]] worship sees the [[The Awakening]] as a second chance for [[Zol]] granted by the [[Zolaen Gods]]. The defining characteristic of [[Dorian]] belief is the focus on perfection in the eyes of [[The Watcher]], or more accurately the Church's interpretation of [[The Watcher]]'s vision.\n\n## Values\n- Perfection\n- Striving for a better world\n- [[The Watcher]]'s vision for a second world\n- Forgiveness through [[The Awakening]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n-  The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[The Watcher]]\n\t- [[The Night Empress]]\n\t- [[The Lifeweaver]]\n\t- [[Yanneran]]\n\t- [[Tellab, the Wise]]\n\t- [[Giriam]]\n\t- [[Ayamot]]\n\t- [[Ohlit]]\n- Lesser [[Gods]] allied to the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\t- [[Bethar]]\n\t- [[Ellyon and Aradon]]\n- [[The Trinity]]\n\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Dorian]] scripture tells of [[The Watcher]] defeating [[Goh'zul]], then speaking [[The First Tongue]]. [[Arkian]] belief states that by speaking it in that moment, [[The Watcher]] created [[The First Tongue]]. Though this power he bound the other [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[The Trinity]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Dorian]] scripture teaches that ancient society was advanced and holy. However, it is thought that some darkness overtook the world in the later ages, which eventually lead to [[The Undoing]]. The specific nature of this darkness varies widely across various [[Dorian]] churches, and individual interpretation.\n\n### The Undoing\nAs a whole, [[Dorian]] belief does not agree much on the exact nature of what caused [[The Undoing]]. Though this has not caused too much discourse within the denomination because much of [[Dorian]] belief focuses on the idea that [[The Awakening]] was a salvation for the people of [[Zol]]. Though the main belief's within [[Dorian]] worship regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]] are:\n- Some great sin was carried out by all, or most of ancient civilization that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world.\n- Some great sin was carried out ancient [[Humans]] that caused the [[Zolaen Gods]] to destroy the old world. This belief is largely what is accepted within the [[Dorian]] churches of [[Gethsemane]].\n- An imbalance within [[The Trinity]] caused [[The Undoing]], but the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]]. This theory is particularly known for having many specific interpretations, and being particularly vague.\n- Some dark force such as [[The Anti-Trinity]] or [[The Shroud of the Void]] attacked [[Zol]], and caused [[The Undoing]]. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] saved the people of [[Zol]].\n\n## Church Structure\n[[Dorian]] churches can manifest in one of two ways. The first being places of worship which are structured to worship all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] as a whole. These are called Octainiaries, after the eight gods. The second are places of worship structured to follow a specific member of the [[Zolaen Gods]], called Moniaries. The latter still pay respect to the pantheon as a whole, but they focus on the specific teachings and domain of a singular god.\n\nChurches may form as an individual organization, but often they are part of a larger collection of churches. Most commonly this is limited to the scope of a whole city, but sometimes they exceed that boundary.\n\nChurches are headed either an **Octavian Priest**, or a **Monian Priest** based on the type of church. Churches with a wider network are headed by **Zoltrum Octavian**, or a **Zoltrum Monian**. Beneath an Octavian or Monian Priest there are usually **High Priests**, and **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on the idea of betterment, and rediscovery of the world. By making [[Zol]] a better place, and comprehending it, one takes strides towards [[The Watcher]]'s true vision of [[Zol]].\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief largely focuses on the ideas of perfection, and living the *correct* way. This manifests as doing everything in ones power to excel at the things one dedicates themselves to, and present themselves as exemplary in the eyes of their peers, and [[The Watcher]]. In doing so, they become a piece of [[The Watcher]]'s great plan for [[Zol]]. Fundamentalist belief is also directed outwards. Fundamental Dorians often cast judgement on others, especially those who live sinful lives, or worship other gods.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[Dorian]] worship is extremely widespread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]]. Most notably in the western kingdoms of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Other Information\n-  [[Arkian]] worship is very similar to [[Dorian]] worship, however they differ in the sense that [[Arkian]] belief focuses on the idea of inherited sin, and atonement. [[Arkian]] belief sees the modern world as an opportunity for atonement. [[Dorian]] belief instead focuses on the idea of the modern world being a second chance at life. The two churches were once a single denomination, but diverged long ago. This divergence occurred before razing events like the [[Beast Ire]] Plague, and possibly even [[The Dragon War]]. The true nature of this divergence has been lost to time, and is largely debated.\n- Theologians and sociologist believe that in the coming centauries, more branches of Zolaen-Centric belief will break off [[Dorian]] worship due to differences in beliefs regarding the cause of [[The Undoing]].\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- The Church of The Watcher, in the West of [[The Three Corners]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.708233069Z","tags":null},"/Draedon-the-Ascended-Wizard":{"title":"Draedon, the Ascended Wizard","content":"*Wayward God of The Arcane Arts, Minor Deity*\n![[Draedon.png]]\n\nThe uncontested, He who has unraveled the secrets of [[Arcana]].

They are few in number, but posses both a power and culture unlike any other. There are many types of dragons, each with its own unique traits and dispositions. The presence of [[Dragons]] shaped [[Zol]] in its early days after [[The Awakening]], and their influence continues to this day.\n\n[[Dragons]] come in many shapes and sizes. Most commonly they are known for their large scaled bodies, giant wings, toothy maws, and magical influence. Most are known for their intelligence and capacity for speech. However, not all dragons fit into this categorization. Some have strange physiology like massive turtle shells, smooth skin or serpent like bodies. Others do not posses the high intelligence or speech commonly associated with [[Dragons]]. \n\nTheir species itself is actually made up of a wide range of many unique subspecies. Plenty have been categorized and documented, but there is still much to be learned about [[Dragons]]. Most fit into the species that academia has indexed, but others are referred to as Dracis Obscura, as they possess unique, poorly understood characteristics.\n\nDragons relate to each other in strange ways. Most are solitary, however they do interact with each other more than one would expect. Each has their own unique name, and place in dragon society. Those who have spoken with dragons have discovered that they surprisingly know many of their peers. Most dragons have friends, rivals, and love interests. Dragons largely view the people of [[Zol]] as lesser, however they pay quite a bit of attention to the world's civilizations. Most see them as prey, others see them as friends, some merely find them entertaining. Some ignore mortals entirely.\n\nSome traits are shared amongst all [[Dragons]]. The first is an affinity for [[Magic]]. The degree with which this occurs varies greatly based on the type of dragon, however all seem to exude and influence over [[Magic]] not seen in other creatures. The other is increased power with age. Most [[Dragons]] are thought to be immortal, and if they are not they typically live for hundreds of years. As they age, both their magical and physical power increases. Ancient Dragons are typically around 1000 years old, and their magic is so powerful that it can actually effect the environment near to their lair.\n\n## Chromatic Dragons\nSpawned from the body of [[Zelatt]], [[Chromatic Dragons]] are the most common type of Dragon. They are known for their evil and chaotic nature, as well as their connection to [[Energy]] and tell tale colors. \n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are infamous for hoarding treasure, and sewing chaos. They are the offspring of [[Zelatt]], the Void God of Chaos. From her form she is able to create powerful [[Chromatic Dragons]]. These dragons go on to reproduce on their own, but they all connect back to her essence. They do not serve her directly, but their behavior tends to serve [[Zelatt]] well. The dark being is said to feed off of chaos, and [[Chromatic Dragons]] are usually well entertained by this concept. However not all [[Chromatic Dragons]] are evil, some take on very unique personalities.\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are categorized by color, and corresponding energetic affinity. Offspring are known to take on only a single color of their parentage at random.\n\n- Red Dragons - Fire [[Energy]]\n- White Dragons - Frost [[Energy]]\n- Blue Dragons - Lightning [[Energy]]\n- Grey Dragons - Necrotic [[Energy]]\n- Yellow Dragons - Radiant [[Energy]]\n- Green Dragons - Poisonous [[Energy]]\n- Black Dragons - Acidic [[Energy]]\n- Purple Dragons - Cognitive [[Energy]]\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] which are born directly from [[Zelatt]] are called Fractal Dragons. They are extremely powerful, and have unique powers.\n\n[[Chromatic Dragons]] are known for their hate towards [[Metallic Dragons]]\n\n## Metallic Dragons\n[[Metallic Dragons]] are the acolytes of [[Ayamot]]. They are the rare, good-willed counterpart to [[Chromatic Dragons]]. No one truly knows if [[Metallic Dragons]] were created to defend the people of [[Zol]] from [[Chromatic Dragons]], but many believe that this is the case. They first appeared to the people of [[The Three Corners]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Some say they manifested from light, others claim they broke free of their slumber from deep within [[The Underdark]]. Regardless of their origin, they are a very rare cast of dragons who largely seem concerned with the concept of order and justice. However some have strayed from this, and act on their own accord. Some even live more similarly to their evil cousins, the [[Chromatic Dragons]].\n\nThe Draconic names for their various subspecies are long complicated phrases, but academics categorized them based on the metallic content of their scales. The latter names stuck better than the former. The types of [[Metallic Dragons]] are: \n- Gold Dragons\n- Silver Dragons\n- Bronze Dragons\n- Copper Dragons\n- Brass Dragons\n- Mercury Dragons\n- Steel Dragons\n- Platinum Dragons\n\n[[Metallic Dragons]] are rivals with [[Chromatic Dragons]], however they do not seek their destruction. They only seem concerned with enacting justice when a line is crossed.\n\n## Gem Dragons\nThe extremely rare offspring of [[Metallic Dragons]] and [[Chromatic Dragons]]. These [[Dragons]] are known to be quite powerful, and exceptionally rare. They are easily distinguished by their crystalline scales. So little is known about these dragons that academics hesitate to define their behavior. However from what is known, it seems that their disposition varies greatly amongst the specimens recorded. The recorded types of Gem Dragons are:\n- Amethyst Dragons\n- Emerald Dragons\n- Sapphire Dragons\n- Topaz Dragons\n- Obsidian Dragons\n\nTheir rarity is likely a product based on the divide between Chromatic and Metallic Dragons.\n\n## Lesser Dragons\nMany species exist that have some of the physical and magical characteristics of greater dragons like [[Chromatic Dragons]], or [[Metallic Dragons]]. Some of them exhibit high intelligence, but few posses the capacity for speech. As a whole, Lesser Dragons are not nearly as powerful as some of their more magically inclined cousins. Some examples of Lesser Dragons are:\n- Drakes\n- Wyverns\n- Pseudodragons\n- Faerie Dragons\n\n## Dracis Obscura\nThe Strange, and obscure dragon specimens academics have made note of over the years which do not match up with other [[Dragons]]. They are exceedingly rare, and thought to be exceptionally powerful. Many believe that some members of this category are entirely unique manifestations of magic, and not part of a greater species. Some examples of these creatures are:\n- Dragon Turtles\n\t- Colossal sea dragons who posses shells as large as small islands.\n- Pink Dragons\n\t- Strange dragons some believe to be a type of Chromatic Dragon, however they are said to have a unique, *dumb* appearance. Those who claim to have encountered them say that they are unconcerned with the concept of violence and greed, and are much more interested in having fun and telling jokes.\n- Sea Wyrms\n\t- Wicked and powerful sea monsters who are frequent mentions in the stories of sailors. Said to have long, serpent like bodies, and seek pirate treasure.\n- Brain Dragons\n\t- A folk legend dating all the way back to [[The Illithid Invasion]]. It is said that the parasitic nature of [[Illithids]] was able to take over the bodies of dragons, converting them into unimaginable horrors.\n- Dracolich\n\t- Said to be dragons who have willingly undergone the effects of powerful necromancy, making them fearsome and undead.\n- The Draxolotl\n\t- A legend of [[The Witchlands]]. A supposed legendary dragon who lives within the lakes of the regions, and appears similarly to an axolotl or salamander. A benevolent being who grants wishes to those who find him.\n\n## Stages of Dragon Maturity\nDragons increase in power as they age. Lesser Dragons experience this on a much smaller scale, but Chromatic, Metallic, and Gem Dragons move through quite the range of power.\n\n- Hatchling - 1 to 5 years\n\t- Small and very influenceable creatures. A hatchling would be a fairly dangerous threat to a commoner. However one encountering one should be more concerned with their mother who would likely be nearby.\n- Young Dragon - 5 to 100 years\n\t- Proud temperamental beings. Young dragons are quite dangerous, but they lack the wisdom, size, and magic of their elders.\n- Adult Dragon - 100 to 800 years\n\t- Powerful, and fearsome creatures. An attack from an adult dragon would spell many casualties for a city. In their advanced age, they posses a wisdom that is rarely seen in most beings.\n- Ancient Dragon - 800 to 1200 years\n\t- Some of the most dangerous, and awe inspiring beings in [[Zol]]. Ancient dragons posses an understanding of the world that many academics would give their right leg to document. An attack from an Ancient Dragon would leave permanent scars on a city.\n- Wyrm - 1200 to 1600 years\n\t- Extremely rare, and spectacularly powerful beings. Few Wyrms have even been documented. Their power would be great enough to possibly destroy a small city on their own. However beings of this capacity would likely not trouble themselves with the pitiful world of mortals.\n- Great Wyrm - 1600+ years \n\t- There are no records of encounters with Great Wyrms, however some Dragons have spoken of these beings. It is not know what power they hold, but they are understood to essentially be small [[Gods]].\n\n## Historical Significance\nThe most notable impact of [[Dragons]] in [[Zol]]'s history is [[The Dragon War]].\n\n## Dragons and Society\nIn modern day, [[Dragons]] are often feared and revered in [[Zol]]'s stories. Few dragon sightings occur, and even fewer attacks. It is thought that most dragons spend their time in hibernation. It is not known why this is, and [[Dragons]] asked of it refuse to answer.\n\nTwo races bear charactristics, and by extension the prejudice of [[Dragons]]. These [[Races]] are [[Dragonborn]] and [[Kobolds]]. The connection between [[Dragons]] and these races are not understood, however it is known that neither race possesses the strength and magic that greater dragons do.\n\nSome believe that the Greater [[Dragons]] are a dying thing of the past. Other say they walk amongst the people of [[Zol]] in magical person-like forms.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.71823312Z","tags":null},"/Dragonstalkers":{"title":"Dragonstalkers","content":"See [[Hoss]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.71823312Z","tags":null},"/Dreadslayers":{"title":"Dreadslayers","content":"*Bearing the burden of Iron and Silver*\n![[Fort Bramble.png]]\n\nAn enclave of skilled monster slayers who protect the northern regions of [[Kapesh]] from dangerous monsters who migrate down from [[The Witchlands]]. Members join at a young age, and are typically those who are left on the wayside by society. They are taught the sword, bow, and magic. But combat is not the full extent of their expertise. They are also educated on history, [[Alchemy]], and monsterology.\n\nThey are not a very well known group, even within their region. This is due to their small numbers, and intentionally low profile. However, those who do know of them usually identify them by their mutations. [[Dreadslayers]] are given enhanced physical and mental abilities through Alchemical Mutations and unconventional magic. A process known as **The Transaction**. This gives them a few identifiable physical traits such as: taste buds on the pallet of one's mouth, purple tinted keratin debris under the fingernails, honey comb like patterns forming under the skin during bruising. Though most notable are their orange-yellow eyes.\n\n![[Danray.png]]\n\n## Values\n*\"Our predecessors picked up the sword long ago, fighting for a way of life within North [[Kapesh]].

They acts as the line of defense which protects North [[Kapesh]] from getting overrun by monsters from [[The Witchlands]]. Their task is one without end. Culling monster populations. It is a dangerous, and weighty task. They are trained to make highly educated decisions on how to best deal with crises involving monsters. They are also known to loyally support their allies, especially in a fight. Lastly, they are not allowed to involve themselves in political matters. [[Dreadslayers]] see themselves as a necessity to society, and putting a barrier between the people and [[Dreadslayers]] would jeopardize their mission.\n\n## Origin\nIt is not precisely known when or how [[Dreadslayers]] came to be. Many speculate that they originated during the [[Beast Ire]] plague.\n\n## Structure\n[[Dreadslayers]] do not have a very structured hierarchy. The chain of command that is in place is based on experience. Those with 50+ years of experience are all sort of seen around the same level of authority. Though all [[Dreadslayers]] fall under the command of a single individual, Danray.   \n- ### Leadership\n\t- Danray (no surname) is one of the oldest and most skilled [[Dreadslayers]].\n- ### Size\n\t- Approximately 40 members\n- ### Rules\n\t- Loyalty to ones compatriots, political agnosticism, upholding of one's duty.\n- ### Admission\n\t- [[Dreadslayers]] are adopted at a young age. Usually from orphanages, or purchased out of [[Slavery]]. This is because **The Transaction**, the process which mutates one into a **Dreadslayer** must be done during adolescence.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- An emblem of a cat-like eye.

Geographically within [[Eucaren]], but considered under the jurisdiction of [[Heliodor]], Elysium station was originally constructed with the express purpose of acting as a commerce and transportation hub for the capital. Being so centrally located and associated with the capital, it quickly grew into a small city in its own right. However it is extremely young for a city, and faces many issues that Heliodor does not due to its privilege as a flying city. These issues manifest as bandits, monsters, and overpopulation. Many people view it as part of the capital itself, but it has its own distinct citizens and culture that make it a unique city.\n\n![[elysium_station.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city breathes in and out with the flow of the capital above. In the morning, workers flood out of the city to serve in [[Heliodor]], and return to their homes at days end. Resources and important individuals flow through the station like a river. The humble city has an atmosphere of importance despite its size. |\n| Main Challenge | The city lives in the shadow of [[Heliodor]]. Figuratively and literally. As much opportunity exists within [[Elysium Station]], sometimes citizens can't help but feeling lowly in comparison to the capital above. The desires and consumption of the grand capital can have unfortunate biproducts for the city below. Being an extremely young city, it is incapable of handling many of its problems with grace.  |\n| Climate | Temperate/Dry |\n| Cuisine | Farmed good, fish, breads, and pastries |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Medium |\n| City Leader | Lord Segume Maude |\n| Primary Language(s) | None |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, Riverside, Forested |\n| Architecture | Timber Frame, white stone, red clay tile roofs |\n| Color(s) | Purple, Grey, Gold |\n| Symbolism | A simple balloon based airship above a symmetrical city |\n| Defenses | Walls, proximity to well defended capital |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group     | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Nobility  | Social Class | The wealthy members of the city, charged with the operation of the station. A small group of very proud individuals who see themselves as very important. However outside parties view them as those who either 'didn't quite make it' to the capital, or those who are unfavored by more important nobility and are pushed out of the capital as punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Commoners | Social Class | The vast majority. Those who either work to keep the station functioning, or are employed within [[Heliodor]] in some humble profession. Shop keepers, farmers, servants, guards, performers, airship crew, maintenance, janitorial, gardeners, and things of the like. Most people leave the city via the [[Skyferry]] at morning and return at dusk, but some face more complex shift work coming and going at odd hours. To work in the city above, one must acquire a special certification called a [[Flatkey]]. Which are small brass keys provided to workers who can go in and out of the city. |\n| Beggars   | Social Class | The few who have fallen on hard times, or come to the city in hopes to receive aid from generous nobility. Be it donation or employment. There are fanciful rumors about the great golden city where anyone can get help from the flying capital. However these were merely rumors stemmed from propaganda. Most who beg within the city are mistreated or ignored. They are pushed from view of coming and going nobles to the slum of Wide Side.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Slaves    | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense.

Lord Maude is notably not a High Lord. The city is under the jurisdiction of the capital, [[Heliodor]]. Making the true power of the city [[King Tatelak II]]. However this is technically the case for all city's of [[Laenwalde]], so it doesn't make much of a functional difference here. However the public opinion of the ruling powers within [[Elysium Station]] is that they do not posses true political sway. Many view them as if they are lowly compared to other nobility.\n\nLord Maude himself does well with the stations management. However he is surrounded by many rumors of him being resentful towards his position and the king. \n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, the city is merely seen as a waypoint. Most don't even consider it a true city.\n\n## Historical Importance\nIt is the youngest city in all of [[The Three Corners]] even more so than [[Heliodor]] itself. Built to serve as a proxy and gateway for the flying city, [[Elysium Station]] finds itself growing slowly but surely as more and more opportunities emerge.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.72623316Z","tags":null},"/Enchantment":{"title":"Enchantment","content":"A term often used to describe the utilization [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] or [[Iron Light]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.72623316Z","tags":null},"/Enchantment-School":{"title":"Enchantment (School)","content":"[[Enchantment (School)]]is one of the many [[Schools of Magic]].

They were aware of the existence of outsiders, but knew they bonded no [[Sylfs]]. This fact, and the guidance of the [[Sylfs]] kept [[Ep Drukar]] hidden away from the rest of the world for more than 2000 years. When it was eventually discovered, the following relationships between [[Ep Drukar]] and its neighboring cities were peaceful in nature. However their long standing disconnection has made it difficult for the city and its people to integrate with the outside world. Outsider's who visit [[Ep Drukar]] will find unique culture, vast wisdom, and strange magic. However they will also find stubbornness, a lack of modern technology, and naiveite regarding the outside world. |\n| Climate                  | High altitude

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| The Five       | City Elders      | A group of five leaders made up from each type of [[Genasi]]: Water, Fire, Air, and Earth. As well as an unbound [[Genasi]], also called a *Halcyon* [[Genasi]]. This council is charged with guiding their city's decisions, and ensuring daily life is maintained. Each member of the five selects their successor, unless they perish suddenly. In that case the successor is chosen by the remaining four. |\n| Water Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Mistings, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of water. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be very well balanced individuals. Putting a lot of effort into personal growth, relationships, hobbies, and work they do.                                                                                                                                       |\n| Fire Genasi    | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Cindrins, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Fire. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be extremely passionate individuals. Separating logic and emotion is quite difficult for a Fire [[Genasi]]. They are known as dedicated go-getters, die hard friends, and also to be a bit of a pain in the ass.                                                 |\n| Earth Genasi   | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Stalegs, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Earth. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be very thoughtful, and intelligent individuals. They have a reputation of taking their time with everything they do. They are known for being always considerate, and always late.                                                                              |\n| Air Genasi     | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who bond Typhis, which are [[Sylfs]] of the plane of Air. While each one is individually unique, they are known to be wild and care free. Their flippant attitudes can be frustrating at times, but their fun loving ideals, and excitable personalities tend to outweigh their wandering focus.                                                                                    |\n| Halcyon Genasi | General Populace | [[Genasi]] of the city who do not bond [[Sylfs]]. There are many opinions of this type of [[Genasi]], but the most prominent one is that they are lesser or simple. This is an unspoken thing, and very frowned upon to say aloud. However many who bind [[Sylfs]] find it difficult to not feel this way. The fact of the matter is they are no more simple than their bound neighbors, they merely did not find a sylf with a compatible personality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name               | Type   | Description                                                                                                                    |\n| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Temple of Tsarde'n | Keep   | The city's central structure. Home to the Five and the monastic teachings of wisdom and combat within the city.                |\n| Lazzul's Tavern    | Tavern | The city's most notable drinking establishment and lodging. A very humble establishment, but a staple by the city's standards. |\n| Midern Market      | Market | The city's market square                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by The Five. A group of elders responsible for the city's well being. They lead the Temple of Tsarde'n and posses a very small, but capable group of fighters. Members of the five give up their old name when taking the mantle of elder, they instead use the name given to the position.\n\nThe Five are as follows:\n- Hilaen, Elder of Water\n- Sidoren, Elder of Fire\n- Yimir, Elder of Earth\n- Aesudon, Elder of Air\n- Kaldeg, the Halcyon Elder\n\nThe elders maintain a city where everyone is treated as equals, and has their needs met to the best of the cities abelites. However the city's remote nature, and mountain top location does mean that they fall on hard times on occasion.\n\n### Laws\nThe city does not posses a written set of laws. Disputed matters are decided by The Five. Things like: murder, theft, trespassing, fraud, and things of the like are almost always lead to sever punishment. [[Genasi]] culture simply views these things as so obviously wrong they do not need specific rules, merely the wisdom of elders to deal with.\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Ep Drukar]] is one of the many cities who has an almost mythical reputation. It is extremely remote, and no teleportation circle, or train can take you there. To reach it one must venture very very far.\n\nThe city has almost no impact in the grand scheme of [[The Three Corners]]. However some [[Genasi]] leave the city on pilgrimages, bringing stories of their strange homeland with them. \n\n## Historical Importance\nLong ago, the city's existence was not even known to outsiders. It was only in the year 2811 that elven scouts discovered it. At the time, [[Gethsemane]] was at war with [[Kapesh]] and did not wish to have an enemy on multiple fronts. Peace treaties were quickly put in place and [[Ep Drukar]] was allowed to continue its way of life uninterrupted.\n\nThis neutrality was maintained during the [[Western War]]. [[Ep Drukar]] sits very close to the border of [[The Glassius Reach]] and [[Gethsemane]]. However all the involved cities knew their peaceful ways, and allowed [[Ep Drukar]] to maintain a neutral party in the conflict.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The surrounding region, called Tsarde'n by the [[Genasi]] is not thought to be a geographical region. Its borders are more fluid, and defined only by the guidance of [[Sylfs]]. It is said that Tsarde'n is where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is the thinnest.\n- There are many rumors about an ancient and horrible secret located in the center of the Temple of Tsarde'n, and that the real reason for the [[Genasi]]'s isolation is to protect this secret. It is also thought that this thing is the reason for the easily obtained peace treaties with its neighboring cities. \n- There are no slaves in [[Ep Drukar]]\n- Education within the city is typically done through monastic tradition conducted at the Temple of Tsarde'n.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.72823317Z","tags":null},"/Eptro":{"title":"Eptro","content":"*Wayward God of Ice, Minor Deity*\n![[Eptro.png]]\n\nLord of the frost, Eptro is the spirit of ice and the frozen expanses that exist in [[Zol]].

Academic evidence found in [[The Grand Nothing]] indicates that [[Eptro]] is one half of a greater being that was fractured into two parts. Its other half being [[Daetro]], who it seems to act opposite to.\n\n## Depiction\nWitnessed as a giant humanoid form of ice that forms and shatters constantly as it moves. Its presence causes the surrounding environment to freeze over almost instantaneously.\n\n## Symbolism\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol of frost.\n\n## Behavior\nActing more like a force of nature rather than a conventional god, [[Eptro]] cares for its domain of [[The Korus Arctic]]. It defends its sanctity like a sort of sentinel, making it very hard for explorers to venture deep into its mysterious realm.\n\nKnown for sending beasts and envoys after those who travel too far north, [[Eptro]] does occasionally form bonds with mortals granting them guidance and powers.\n\n## Realm\n[[Eptro]] is one of the few gods who resides on the [[Prime Material Plane]].

Its thorn covered forests are filled with disturbing monsters, and it is constantly under the cover of night.\n\nThe [[Fell]] is infamous for its influences on the [[Prime Material Plane]]: like the afflictions of Lycanthropy and Vampirism.\n\n![[fell 2.png]]\n\n## Citizens of the Fell\nWithin the Fell, there is a sole city known as [[Dislimn]]. The city itself has a frightening appearance, but they never turn anyone away.\n\n![[Dislimn skyline.png]]\n\nThe City is by no means safe, and newcomers are typically prayed upon. However it is quite easy to find work and the cost of living is quite low. On top of that it is know for having delicious foods served at low prices.\n\nThe *local* population is made up of beings who fled the [[Prime Material Plane]] to escape their old lives, or beings who were born there.\n\nThe higher classes of society are typically high vampires, powerful lycanthropes, or [[Shades]] which are descendants of beings whos family has lived in the [[Fell]] for many generations. These beings are very rare and appear almost as dark tears in reality in the shape of their lineage's race. There is also a rare population of [[Fairies]] that reside in the [[Fell]], these are often referred to as *Foes*.\n\nStrangely, silver is hated amongst those native to the [[Fell]]. Academics do not know why this is, but [[Fell]] natives experience great pain when in contact with the substance and can even claim to smell a putrid scent off of those who have worn silver recently.\n\n## Travel to the Fell\nSince the [[Fell]] is an echo of the [[Prime Material Plane]], travel between these planes is much simpler than most other cases.

Each one of these is a unique symbol directly relating to a property of [[Zol]]. Theorized to be a product of [[The First Tongue]], these runes allow for the utilization of [[Iron Light]].\n\nThere are 10 classifications of runes\n\n### Infra-Runes\nRunes that reference the world outside of the topic of magic\n- Connective\n- Material\n- Spatial\n- Elemental\n- Energetic\n- Philosophical\n- Bodily\n- Planar\n\n### Meta-Runes\nRunes that reference magic itself\n- Scholarly\n- Magical\n\n## The Ferric Table\n![[Ferric Alphabet.png]]\n\n## Signets\nA signet is a special pseudo-rune that does not subscribe to the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. A signet is a unique shape included in an [[Apparatum]]. It is either a piece of inlayed iron, or a symbol deeply carved into iron. It is grouped with an informational rune as well as an objective rune. This structure can be used as a unique identifier for an [[Apparatum]], or to communicate between devices if made in sets. Sets must be as identical as possible, typically made via [[Magic]].\n\nIt is imperative that signets are completely unique or they risk interacting with others that are they are not intended to. Some malicious individuals will exploit this weakness, and create devices that will interact with [[Apparatum]] they were not intended to. This can be used to listen in on communications, open doors, and sabotage devices. Some [[Artificers]] counter these attacks by embedding their signets deep within the devices, or hiding false signets.\n\nSome devices implement a modular signets so they can be configured to communicate with many devices. This is difficult to operate skillfully, and even more difficult to create. The shape of a signet only seems to matter upon 2 dimensions, rather than 3. It is not known why this is, likely because of the 2 dimensionality of the [[Ferric Alphabet]], but it makes modular signets much more achievable.\n\nDue to their need to be unique, many [[Artificers]] adopt a unique style to their signets, using them almost like a signature. Hence the name.\n\n## Runic Common\nRunic Common is a cypher originally from [[The Ward]] and has been popularized by philosophers and artists. It creates a one-to-one relationship between the common alphabet and the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. It bears no magical significance and was largely developed for religion and arts. Many scholars have great distaste for it, but it bears a cultural significance to many all across [[Zol]].\n\n![[Runic Common.png]]\n\n## Relation to Iszertion\nMany have sought to form a connection between [[Iszertion]] and [[Iron Light]].

There are an evil cast of heinous creatures. They are either the descendants of, or the very beings who were created long ago to destroy [[Goh'zul]]. \n\nLong before The [[Sea of Monsters]] even existed. [[Goh'zul]] was a being who had the power to create worlds, grow them, and devour them to satiate his endless hunger. Many of the worlds he made were aware of his existence, and tried to stop their destruction. A strange, repeating phenomenon occurred in many of these realms. Legions of [[Fiends]] were made by the gods of these long dead worlds in a futile attempt to strike back at [[Goh'zul]]. They would be given a realm of their own, called a *Hell*. It is not know why this phenomenon happened so regularly. Perhaps it was part of [[Goh'zul]]'s design, or perhaps it was just convergent evolution of these worlds.\n\nAs a method of payment, the gods would often send the souls of sinners to the fiends as payment. It is not known why this transaction was made, but many assume it was for sustenance or to entertain them. Regardless, the exchange largely kept them at bay.\n\nDespite the efforts of these worlds, it was never enough to defeat him. When he would consume them, he would leave the hells undigested (for lack of a better term). They sat trapped in his body for eons. Eventually, they began colliding and merging. When they all formed into one singular, colossal realm, a massive war amongst them eventually left [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] as their ruler.\n\nNot all [[Fiends]] are evil, supposedly some of them in [[Apolyatum]] are quite reasonable and person-like. However the vast majority are nefarious and horrifying. Their once mission to destroy [[Goh'zul]], and their hatred towards him for trapping them in his body like a prison has only fortified their original mission to destroy him. However, since he is dead that hate is instead aimed at the world of [[Zol]].\n\n[[Demons]] are distinctly different from [[Fiends]]. [[Fiends]] are forced to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they resist him, they are destroyed. [[Demons]] are largely unbound, and can do what they wish. This makes many [[Demons]] prideful over [[Fiends]], fueling a rivalry between the two casts of horrible creatures.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.734233201Z","tags":null},"/Fike":{"title":"Fike","content":"*The Largest city of The Ward*\n![[Fike Skyline 2.png]]\n\nSurrounded by hilly farmland, [[Fike]] is the most populated of the north-eastern cities.

It is the largest city, and most of the regions exports that are sent to foreign kingdoms come from it.\n\n## Historical Importance\nDuring [[The Dragon War]], Fike was the stage for the final weeks of the war. Most of [[The Ward]]'s cities had been destroyed. Of the remaining three, it was the only city with the farmland to sustain the kingdom. If its infrastructure were lost, it would spell doom for [[The Ward]]. All those who fought under [[The North Honor]] gave their all to protect it.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Many call [[Fike]] the Driftwood city. This is because the ocean currents carry storm-thrown driftwood from The Storm Isles to its shores in great piles.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.736233211Z","tags":null},"/Firbolgs":{"title":"Firbolgs","content":"*Peaceful and Brave*\n![[Firbolg.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Firbolgs]] are known to be generally agreeable people.

Each team has a raft held 100 feet above water that is 2 feet by 25 feet, called a **Rung**. Each team has 5 **Beams**, and 3 **Catchers**. **Beams** are not allowed to fly, and stand in a row upon their raft, each armed with 2 sandbags wrapped in a buoyant material called **Bells**. Their goal is to knock their opponents off their raft suspended 20 feet away from their own by throwing their **Bells**.\n\nThe **Catcher** comes in if a **Bell** misses its target, or a **Beam** is knocked off. **Catchers** are armed with a **Crosse**, a long stick with a wicker scoop that can be used to throw a **Bell** far and accurately. **Catchers** use their **Crosse** to return missed **Bells** to their team for reuse. Their team is rewarded by their speed. However **Catchers** are not allowed to strike **Beams** with returned **Bells**. **Catchers** are allowed to catch their team's falling **Beams** and return them to their **Rung** given the falling **Beam** never touched the water.\n\nIf a **Rung** has no **Beams** upon it, that team loses.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.736233211Z","tags":null},"/Form-Art":{"title":"Form Art","content":"The performance art of [[Changelings]] that involves altering ones body in an artistic display.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.736233211Z","tags":null},"/Galliard-Crown":{"title":"Galliard Crown","content":"See [[King Galliard]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.740233231Z","tags":null},"/Gate-Town":{"title":"Gate Town","content":"A [[Gate Town]] is a portion of the city that is constructed outside the main wall. [[Zol]] is an extremely dangerous place; bandits, monsters, and war have shaped the nature of cities in very clear ways throughout [[Zol]]'s history. Walls were constructed to protect cities from these threats. However, walls hinder the expansion of a city. This limits the amount of people who can live within the safety of a city's walls.\n\nIdeally, one wants to be within the walls if they fear the dangers of [[Zol]]. However, the next best thing to living within the walls is to live just outside of them. As these regions are patrolled by city garrisons, and most can take refuge inside the inner city during a siege. Additionally, the proximity to a city allows for one to benefit from its economy and living in a [[Gate Town]] is much more accessible to most commoners. Due to these factors, [[Gate Town]]s have consistently popped up all over [[Zol]] as soon as city walls are constructed.\n\nA similar phenomenon to this is [[Outer Villages]], which are more a product of agriculture than [[Gate Town]]s are a product of other forms of commerce. Both are populated almost exclusively by lowly commoners, and are usually the first to feel the wrath of warfare when it finds a city. Additionally, since there is no physical barrier stopping bandits and monsters from entering, these communities often find themselves at the mercy of these dangers.\n\nAnother related concept is [[Estates]] which are walled properties of land outside of the city, usually owned by the rich.

I think it mostly comes from the fact that I as a person have a hard time wrapping my mind around these concepts. I wanted to leave it up to the user (Like a Dungeon Master running a game in D\u0026D 5e deciding how many people live within an area, rather than me telling it strictly beforehand). I think that adjusting the population to better fit the story being told, rather than applying firm numbers is better.\n\n*Similarly for distance, I don't like to think about how many days by train, horse, or foot it takes to get from A to B until it makes sense for the pacing of the story that is being told.*\n\n*However, there are a few things I intended for these concepts which will help define relative numbers when storytelling in Zol.*\n\n## Population\n[[Cities]] are meant to feel very populated, even small cities should feel like they are relatively dense in their population. A city, and its surrounding area should feel like province of its own. Cities are ancient and massive, overflowing with history and culture. This is because the wilderness is quite dangerous, and it has forced people to all flock to the safety of cities. [[Outer Villages]] should feel much less dense in their population.\n\nThe most populated city is [[Audran]] and the least populated city is [[Little Triumph]].\n\n## Distance\nZol is meant to feel very large. The distances between cities are quite far, and travelling between them is dangerous when not done by train. \n\nTo give a baseline for distance, a trip from [[Rails]] to [[Tenzentak]] would take:\n- 4 days travel on foot\n- 3 days travel on horseback\n- 24 hours via train","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.741233236Z","tags":null},"/Gethsemane":{"title":"Gethsemane","content":"![[Gethsemane.jpg]]\n\nThe Viridescent Kingdom of [[Gethsemane]]. The land of [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and the peaceful [[Genasi]]. [[Gethsemane]] is an old and unvarying kingdom. Outsiders have a difficult time navigating these lands, and [[The Iron Tracks]] are barely present here. This makes the whole kingdom feel almost mythical to outsiders. Each city rules itself with its own unique laws. The region as a whole operates under an allegiance between Elven and Dwarven kingdoms, with the peaceful [[Genasi]] as their neighbors.\n\nTraditions of art, craftsmanship, and magic that date all the way back to [[The Awakening]] are visible all throughout its cities.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Xerul]]\n- [[Mod Dranor]]\n- [[Laelanor]]\n- [[Jerda'll]]\n- [[Ep Drukar]]\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\n[[Gethsemane]] is a lush and beautiful land. It's dominated largely by The Forest of Yan Nalora. A wood of massive trees, crystal streams, as well as strange and dangerous creatures. Tucked into the north are its two mountain cities. The peak city of [[Ep Drukar]], and the subterranean city of [[Mod Dranor]]. These cities are located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]], a grand and perilous range of mountains overlook the garden kingdom.\n\nA second subterranean city is located near central [[Gethsemane]]. [[Jerda'll]] is a kingdom of [[Drow]] built within the colossal caves that wind beneath the land called [[The Underdark]]. A mysterious natural world filled with underground lakes and rivers.\n\nWhile glorious, the wilds are quite dangerous. There is only a single train in [[Gethsemane]] which runs from [[Laenwalde]] to [[Mod Dranor]] for trade purpose. All other travel is by forest road. Outside travelers are urged to move through the region with the help of a well trained guide, lest the find themselves attacked or lost in the wilderness.\n\n## History\nAfter [[The Awakening]], the people of [[Gethsemane]] found themselves in consolidated groups made up of members of their own races. These individuals initially met the same hardships as everyone else, however after a short while they learned that they could live symbiotically with the wilds through knowledge, [[Magic]], and a mutual respect for the environments they lived in.\n\nThe [[Dwarves]] mined into the mountains to construct their kingdom of [[Mod Dranor]], and the [[Elves]] built grand cities highlighting the natural beauty which was already present. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered the presence of one another quite early on. These groups were cautious at first, but found that through mutual respect the cities could coexist.\n\nTo the south was a region known as The Badlands. A feudal realm that would eventually go on to become [[Laenwalde]]. There were many skirmishes at the borders with gangs of roving bandits and small armies of feudal kingdoms. [[Gethsemane]] played an instrumental hand in the forming of this kingdom through support of troops and resources during particular hardship. [[Gethsemane]] is especially to thank for the current state of [[Eucaren]], the north-eastern, and neighboring third of [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] are close allies to this day.\n\nAcross [[The Narrow Sea]], lies the kingdom of [[Kapesh]]. They would go on to become a rivalling kingdom for more than a thousand years. [[Gethsemane]] battled [[Kapesh]] on and off in a conflict known as the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. A war incited by racial and religious differences.\n\nIt wasn't until much later (the year 2811) that the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] discovered that there was a whole city of [[Genasi]] located within the far west peaks of the mountains. This came as a surprise to all parties involved, but there was no major issues that arose as the [[Genasi]]'s lifestyle and demeanor was already very on par with the rest of the kingdom. The [[Genasi]] were determined to be [[Off-Human]] by the elves, a label problematic within the conflicts surrounding the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. However [[Gethsemane]] decided to let the city be as they had remained in the mountains for over two thousand years without ever causing even a quarter of a problem.\n\nIn the late [[First Age]], [[Gethsemane]] and their ally [[Laenwalde]] faced a great deal of political infighting. When investigated, the source of this infighting seemed to stem from [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] masking as important members of their society. This sparked a conflict known as the [[Western War]] where [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] led a counter attack on The Reach. It amounted to one of The Reach's cities, [[Yorn et Gaul]], nearly being destroyed. The conflict stopped when a very powerful [[Wordbearer]] called Ehmalog, Word of Wrath entered the fray to the defense of [[The Glassius Reach]].\n\nEventually in the early [[Second Age]] [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] set aside their differences and formed the [[The Triumvirate]] Concord to end their fighting. [[Gethsemane]] was now focused on its new enemy to the North.\n\n## Inhabitants\nLargely populated with [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], and a small population of [[Genasi]].\n\nSave for the [[Genasi]] city of [[Ep Drukar]], [[Gethsemane]] is an extremely proud and xenophobic kingdom. Each city holds a very strong identity and its citizens do not respond well to anything that may harm it. The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]] live long lives and spend most of them focused on upholding or improving their society.\n\nThere are members of other [[Races]] sprinkled throughout the kingdom, but these individuals are seen as outsiders. At best, they may be welcomed in if they have something special like a well honed skill or gift to offer elven society. However they are more often ignored, or disliked.\n\n[[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] have a mutual respect but tend to view each other as *lesser*. Elves think dwarves are bull headed, slow witted, and do not have appreciation for beauty and art. Dwarves think elves are weak bodied, frivolous, and unproductive beings. They do cohabitate in some cities, but usually in neighborhoods dominated by members of their own race.\n\n[[Genasi]] are people of tradition. They reside high in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Rarely leaving their territory, they went undiscovered for many many years. When they were found, the cities of [[Gethsemane]] determined that they were a peaceful group and would be welcomed into their borders. In reality, very little changed. The [[Genasi]] remained in their home and the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] didn't bother them for the most part. A few curious members from each population did mingle and explore each other's cities. This behavior sparked a small movement of [[Genasi]] who venture out on pilgrimages into the far kingdoms.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom of [[Gethsemane]] are not governed by a single figure. Each city governs itself and its surrounding territory. The kingdoms do not operate as a council like [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], but rather a very strong, millennia old alliance.\n\nEach city cares for its citizens in its own way. Those who have legitimate citizenship do not go without. Even if they are not financially stable. In Elven society it is very rare someone does not strive to contribute in some way to their city. Those who are unable to contribute still easily find food, shelter, and medicine (but its likely they would be looked down upon if they are able bodied). In dwarven society, work is assigned if it is not sought out. Disobeying these assignments is seen as greatly offensive and even criminal at times. The [[Genasi]] have a socialist approach to their city and their slow way of life rarely raises issues. In all cases the sick and elderly are taken care of without question.\n\nEach city is responsible for creating and upholding their own laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt and culture is very deep seated within the cities of [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThe [[Elves]] are known for creating nature-inspired majesty. They practice nearly every craft one could imagine. Individuals spend their entire lives honing their abilities to great heights. This is visible all throughout their societies. Grand architecture, beautiful clothing, fantastic sculptures and paintings, even their armor and weaponry is awe inspiring.\n\n[[Dwarves]] treasure strength, quality, and practicality. This is visible in their cities, homes, tools, and general ways of life. Known for carving their homes and building directly from [[Kalamdola]], their home mountain. Powerful square architecture, engineered with comprehensive mathematics and geometry.\n\nEchoes of their grand city are seen in their smaller works of craftsmanship as well. The precise support pattern upholding the grand bridges that span over the city are sewn into the hemming of garments. The layouts of crucial buildings are embossed onto their army's shields.\n\nMost important to the [[Dwarves]] is the craft of smiting. The tools, weapons, and armor crafted within the city of [[Mod Dranor]] are the finest in all [[The Three Corners]].\n\n[[Genasi]] are people of the four elemental planes:\n- Invigorant, water\n- Immolation, fire\n- Temperament, stone\n- Tempest, air\nTheir art and beliefs surround the poetic ideals that surround these natural phenomena.\n\nAlmost all the people within the kingdom all follow some version of Trinity-Centric or Zolaen-Centric belief.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademics and Magic within [[Gethsemane]] are taught exclusively through mentorship. Nearly all individuals the kingdom spend the first centaury of their life under the mentorship of a set of teachers who specialize in different crafts. Individuals will go on to specialize in craftsmanship, art, magic, academics, or some other career. They will typically go on to spend the majority of their lives in this profession.\n\nNotably, [[Gethsemane]] does not implement [[Iron Light]] as abundantly as the rest of [[The Three Corners]] does. This is due to a deep seated pretention around the concept of [[Great Magic]], a highly debated racial issue regarding [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] being more magically gifted than [[Off-Human]] races. This held belief has made it so [[Artificers]] of [[Gethsemane]] utilize [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] for the production of their magical implements. [[Iron Light]] does exist within the kingdom, it is just uncommon and looked down upon.\n\n## Political Climate\n[[Gethsemane]] appears to have a very static inner political structure. The people of the cities have great love for their rulership, and the rulers themselves maintain good relationships with each other. There is no one ruler or capital, but outsiders tend to view [[Xerul]] as its defacto capital due to its resources, size, grandeur, and mythos around the [[Elves]].\n\nThe resources and cooperation shared between cities makes [[Gethsemane]] a powerhouse of a kingdom. All who have trifled with them have paid the price. Historically, [[Gethsemane]] has gone to war with all of its surrounding regions and has never lost. In modern day it is on good terms with all its neighbors, save for great tensions with [[The Glassius Reach]] since the [[Western War]].\n\nThe people of the kingdom are largely xenophobic, or racist towards outsiders. This is due to old beliefs held regarding [[The Undoing]] and [[Great Magic]]. A sizeable portion of the population does not support these beliefs, but millennia of discrimination is hard to overcome.\n\n## Military\nTacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: modern [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Gethsemane]] has the smaller military, but what they lack in size they make up for in almost every other aspect. [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] are generally more physically capable on average than any other race. Their long lifespans also make it so that they can become very well trained. On top of that, their legendary craftsmanship gives them a literal edge above their foes. All ships in their navy's double as [[Airships]], meaning they need no sea port. There is good reason [[Gethsemane]] has never lost a war.\n\n## Borders\n[[Gethsemane]] borders the kingdoms of:\n- [[Laenwalde]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n- [[Kapesh]]\n\nIt also has borders on the wilds of:\n- [[Holyfield]]\n\nIt contains a portion of the mountain range known as:\n- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]\n- [[The Blades]]\n- As well it decidedly does not consider [[The East Mounts]] within its borders as [[Elves]] believe the region to be cursed. This mountain range is as far south as some superstitious elves will travel.\n\nIt also has coasts on:\n- [[The Vast Sea]]\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.744233252Z","tags":null},"/Giants":{"title":"Giants","content":"Obscure and rare beings of [[Zol]].

[[Gilligan's Lift]] is a great feat of engineering that gives passage from the top of the high cliffs that overlook [[The Grand Nothing]], all the way to the bottom. The lift operates over thousands of feet and can support extremely heavy burdens. Remarkably, the lift originally used no [[Magic]] in its operation.\n\nDesigned by Odile Gilligan, a gifted Halfling academic woman. Gilligan originally decided to construct the lift only using engineering to spark a movement against [[Zol]]'s over reliance on [[Magic]] wielding individuals. \n\n## Design\nBuilt as a wide platform suspended by a massive pulley system. Energy for moving the lift is drawn from massive turbines affixed to the wall of the cliff. Powered by the massive gusts of wind that blow vertically up the cliffs face, energy is stored in large springs. A wide platform acts as the lift itself, built of strong metals and wood to resists the same gusts that power it. This makes it capable of moving large quantities of personnel and equipment.\n\n![[Gilligans Lift.png]] \n\nSince the invention of [[Iron Light]], magical improvements have been made for durability, defense, and efficiency. However the core functionality remains non-magic due to its ingenious design. In modern days a one way trip of the lift takes 5 hours. \n\n## Impact on Society\nThe lift's operation was given to [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. This is because the guild has a reputation of neutrality on the political scale, making the lift accessible to any who would use it with good intentions.\n\nThe cost of operations and profits are managed by the guild, and nobility of [[Tenzentak]]. Security, maintenance, trade deals, tickets, passenger vetting, and staff are all needed to operate the lift.\n\nThe lifts creation marked the first accessible method of the common person being able to venture to the grand nothing. Previously it was only performed by those capable of teleportation.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.744233252Z","tags":null},"/Giriam":{"title":"Giriam","content":"*The Deceased Zolaen God of Agriculture, Fertility, Major Deity*\n![[Giriam.png]]\n\nOnce seen as the caretaker of mortals.

His focus was the quality of life for mortal beings.\n\n## Depiction\nDepicted as a towering being draped in beautifully patterned multicolored cloth.

These fields do not exist as a means of survival for the palace, but rather a massive sprawling garden.\n\n## Worshipers\nAlmost anywhere there is civilization there is/was worship of Giriam. It varies vastly from prayer over meals to grand temples built in his honor. Giriam asked nothing of his followers, but teaches them how to do good in the world.\n\nHis followers seek to give what they have to sustain a community, echoing the behavior of their god.\n\n**Since the death of the god, many have ceased their worship. However, some cling fanatically to their religion. A significant portion of people still believe that Giriam lives.**\n\n## Ahamatath (The Death of Giriam)\nAhamatath, sometimes called The Ahamatath, is the name for the supposed death of [[Giriam]]. It was not at first known by the public that a god had supposedly died, but the effects of his death were immediate and catastrophic. Growth rates all across [[Zol]] varied with great severity. Some places were struck with devastating famine. However others faced unforeseen abundance, causing harvests so bountiful that fruit rotted on the vines, leading to plagues of pests as farmers could not keep up.\n\nBirth rates also faced extreme change. In some places, birth rates plummeted, while others feared overpopulation.\n\nThe public only became aware when other [[Gods]] began to speak of the event. Most denied the events validity, and many still do to this day. However the effects were so widespread that over time, most have come to realize that something significant has effected the domains of agriculture and fertility.\n\nThe initial effects of Giriam's death started to trend towards normalcy 6 years after the gods supposed death. However the secondary effects like societal and theological panic still remains. No one knows how or why a god was killed, and what it means for [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.751233287Z","tags":null},"/Glassian-Laws":{"title":"Glassian Laws","content":"The [[Glassian Laws]] are a set of legal rules set in placed based off the needs of society, and [[The Pattern]].\n\n| Law                        | Severity    | Description                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Slavery                    | High        | No person is allowed to own slaves.

This prejudice is held by many, and has much evidence to back it up. Many goblins live outside of cities in bandit tribes, or live in squalor within cities. However a dive into their history paints a tragic picture of a people forced into hardship.\n\nWriting from the early days after [[The Awakening]] tell of goblins who would eat food considered by most to be 'raw' or 'spoiled'. They would reside in small spaces and drink 'unpotable' water. They were assumed to be unintelligent and dirty because of this. Many would treat them poorly; putting them down both verbally and physically. It was not understood at the time that goblins instinctually organize in a hierarchy. The abuse unknowingly took advantage of this predisposition. It made them timid and subservient. When pushed too far they would lash out in a way that is described in these old texts as 'feral'. \n\nThis mistreatment drove them into the dark corners of society, or from civilization entirely. In modern day, we see [[Goblins]] that thrive when treated equally. Modern science and medicine shows goblins are much more resistant to disease and poison (allowing them to consume things that are raw, spoiled, or unpotable). They are also known to be more comfortable living in small spaces.\n\nDespite the modern understanding, prejudice is a hard thing to be rid of.

Each other!\n\t- Deimos - A monster slayer and his friendly wolf, Wall'e\n\t- Rozwald - A noble artificer\n\t- Cyrus - A mysterious masked individual\n\t- Spade - A gruff drifter, and his fire-spirit Cinder\n\t- Magnus - A Stormblessed northerner and his draconic companion, Viz (Avizandym) \n\t- and Sherman - a free-willed automaton care-taker\n- The our heroes met The Three Fools. A party of established members of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]\n\t- Eddoch - a kindly dwarf clergyman\n\t- Laizen - an awkward, but kind elven swordsman and full marked guild member\n\t- Tardich - a grumpy and reserved cowboy\n- The stretch of Guild cars along the train were interrupted by vault car and luxury car, cutting the party off from the dining car\n- The long journey had left fuses short, and tension quickly formed between Magnus and Spade.\n- it likely would have come to blows if the train hadn't been attacked by [[Warforged]] rebels\n\t- Tons of them shouting odd phrases of rebellion\n\t- Upon their death, they exploded into acid\n- The attack was overwhelming, but luckily (or possibly unluckily) Haith Nallian, the Inheritor of Fire was aboard the train.\n\t- He expediently killed the attackers, and scorched the party in the process\n- After the fight, our heroes checked on Vault and Luxury car. The assumed targets of the attack\n\t- The vault was emptied and its guards killed\n\t- Rozwald cleverly deduced it had been transporting a small, but dangerous container of 1-5 Potentium. A volatile and explosive member of the [[Magical Metals]] often used to create powerful bombs.\n- In the luxury car, Curtis Renaull (nephew of Leonel VanVeld, The Alderian Seat of [[Holocene]]) was sure the attack was directed at him\n\t- He insisted the party protect him, the plainly declined\n- The lot regrouped and recouped.

She warned Magnus of nobility. They may seem unassuming, but there is usually something sinister afoot.\n- Cyrus, the charmer, was able to gain the attention of Gale Goa. Gossip left her lips like a leaky faucet. According to her:\n\t- Lord Curtis Renaull is the nephew of The [[Alderian Seat]] Leonel VanVeld. An extremely rich and powerful man who has apparently grown quite ill. Supposedly he is bedridden often.\n\t- Curtis is making a grab for power. Unfortunately, he is not anyone of peculiar significance amongst his family. So he has to make a name for himself.\n\t- His strategy seems to be courting important women like Lady Mae Preacher, and travelling to cities like [[Tenzentak]] for some unknown, political reason.\n\t- Though there is one issue. His paranoia. Curtis seems convince someone is trying to kill him. His fear has impeded his ability to present as a well composed, noble lord.\n- Gale also spoke of the different types of nobility. \n\t- She was what is known as *local nobility*. Those of who only possess influence within their own city. These local families do their best to appease those with greater influence.\n\t- Then there are the *old nobility*. They are families who's fortunes have outlasted multiple, significant historical events. Such as Lord Grant Septurn. These families have a finger in every pie as far as the economy is concerned. Not much moves them. They only seek to make things stay as steady as possible.\n\t- And finally there are *magnates*. Noble houses with extra-municipal influence like Lord Curtis Renaull. These noble houses are usually on the forefront of change when the world shifts. Some, like Curtis' family, have had money for a very long time. But their desire to move the world defines them as something other than old nobility.\n\t- These three groups are in constant competition with one another as the world shifts and changes. Then there are *foreign nobles*, *outliers*, and *rabble*. Those who don't have a stake in local politics like the characters our heroes masked as, Lady Kalimae Sky, and guests like Rione Elsitor.\n- Sherman, unable to resist, introduced himself to the host, Lord Grant Septurn, and gained himself a tour of the manor.\n- Rozwald, left unattended, got drunk and began causing problems.\n- Deimos, doing his best to fit in, was flirted with by awkward Lord Mavis Morp and invited to watch him duel later.\n- Cyrus changed his disguise, got harassed by Rozwald, and managed to win himself a dance with Lady Mae Preacher. This provoked Lord Curtis Renaull, and drew him onto the dance floor.\n- Deimos and Magnus seized the opportunity, joining them on the dancefloor. Deimos was surprisingly light on his feet. And Magnus never fails when it comes to knocking things over. Swinging Deimos in a combative dance move, they tripped the silver fox. The first of three public humiliations.\n- Sherman was brought to the Septurn Gallery by his very flirty host. He was shown ancient relics from[[ The Grand Nothing]] and a [[Rift Iron]] Sword. Grant displayed the swords amazing self-repairing quality by slamming its edge against the stone floor. The loud, ringing metallic sound, blade aimed at his throat, and the presence of a wolf named grant began to twist his perspective. Causing him to short circuit.\n- Back in the main party, a chandelier fell. Luckily it crushed no one. Though it caused a large panic. Many guests departed and the majority of those who stayed went outside for some fresh air. Many of which began a small dueling circle. Rozwald's drunken passion rallied a passionate crowd\n- Sherman's mind fizzed and he attacked the host. Knocking him out and stashing him in a closet before returning to the party. Magnus detected there was something off with him.\n- Someone was chased out of the party by the guards. No one saw who.\n- Sherman and Magnus hatched a new plan to instigate Curtis by smashing a glass behind him. It startled him, but didn't provoke too much of a reaction. However, it did gain the attention of Bennet Frence who recognized them.\n- Bennet demands they need to leave, but Sherman realizes that Bennet is not supposed to be at the party either. Neither party can snitch on the other easily without stirring suspicions around uninvited partygoers.\n- Our heroes taunt Curtis' posse and goad Curtis into a duel with Lady Falza Mortimer, Aka Deimos.\n- Deimos kicks his butt in the first two bouts. Then Curtis begins playing dirty. He wins, but barely. Though his celebrations seem in bad taste. Winning an unsportsmanlike duel against a noble woman who didn't really want to fight him wasn't much of a win. The second humiliation.\n- After the bout, Kalimae Sky came to the group. Telling they had done well but they really needed to leave. She spoke more plainly now. Apparently the noble houses were causing a false scarcity of resources. They had all gained quite a lot of business from the Ahamatath, the death of [[Giriam]]. Now that things were tending towards normalcy, they were trying to hold on to what they could. Things were looking bad politically. Supposedly [[Kapesh]] hadn't seen the same trends and was still in famine. They are in dire need of resources and no one was trading with them fairly. It may turn to war. Playing with these people during the current state of things is more than dangerous. They thanked her for the warning, but decided to persist. She departed, knowing the evening would end sourly.\n- Our heroes decided to try and land a half cocked plan to deliver some porn to him in the middle of the party as a final humiliation.\n- To their surprise, Curtis had switched masks with Lord Mavis Morp. Suspecting someone was targeting him.\n- Before the party could correct their course all the lights went out. Extinguished by some unseen, powerful magic user.\n- A flash of thunder, a scream, and a dead body.\n- Unknowingly, our heroes' harassment of Curtis had made him so cautious that they unintentionally saved his life. Someone *was* trying to kill him. \n- In the center of the party, Lord Mavis Morp lays dead with a dueling sword in his neck. The sycophant had likely been doing what he could to gain favor, and had lost his life for it.\n- **Chapter ends on the late night of the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.766233363Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-11-The-Masquerade-Murder":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 11 - The Masquerade Murder","content":"- **Chapter begins on the late night of the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had been warned time and time again that the nobility were dangerous to be around. Almost as if being near them would somehow corrupt a person's life.\n- This was confirmed as Lord Mavis Morp had been assassinated before their very eyes. \n- Lord Morp had taken on Lord Curtis Renaull's appearance in an attempt to catch some conspiracy against Lord Renaull. They had succeeded, and it cost Mavis his life.\n- Someone had thrown a dueling sword through Mavis' neck. Curtis' sword, the compliment to the sheath that Mavis' corpse now wore.\n- The trajectory of the sword made a list of immediate suspects:\n\t- Lady Rhea Stoneshard\n\t- Rione Elsitor\n\t- Lord Bennet Frence\n\t- Lady Mae Preacher\n\t- Bax Corsair\n\t- And Lord Curtis Renaull himself, wearing the guise of Lord Mavis Morp\n- The throw was an accurate one, and likely would have been lanced by someone who was either extremely lucky or skilled with a blade.\n- The lights began to come back on and The Corsair Twins, the Son and Daughter of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s Leader took over the chaotic situation quickly. Demanding the guards to lock the place down, and for the guests and staff to sit down so they could be questioned.\n- Cyrus, before seating himself spotted something glinting in the fountain. A crossbow bolt. It looked as if it had been fired from the south west corner of the room, likely missing its already dead target.\n- Everyone is questioned:\n\t- Most of the noble guests seemed to have reasonable explanations. Chatting, fetching food, and giving congratulations.\n\t- Bennet Frence had been outed as a party crasher. It seemed he had a reputation for this behavior.\n\t\t- Bennet then tattled on our heroes, outing them as crashers as well.\n\t\t- Bennet, and our heroes were fined 100 gold each. They were also to be given \"Mop Duty\" for their transgressions.\n\t- Curtis Renaull explained that he didn't know why his own sword had ended up in Mavis' neck. He claimed to have handed it off to a member of staff to be cleaned after his duel with Lady Falza Mortimer.\n\t- Our heroes were then questioned and asked to remove their masks. The guests were outraged when the saw Sherman, a [[Warforged]] amongst them. Curtis most of all.\n\t- Then a sudden, unexpected thing occurred. Guild Mind Colin Coinge arrived to help with the investigations. Likely due to its possible connection to the train attack through Lord Renaull.\n- Surprisingly Master Coinge, who had just accused them of crimes earlier that day, defended our heroes. Giving ample reason as to why the party would not have been the murderers.\n\t- Reminding Curtis that they were some of the fighters who defended him on the train.\n- The sudden appearance of Lord Grant Septurn capped off the questioning period. He appeared to have no recollection of Sherman attacking him. Lord Septurn seemed certain that their encounter had been more *sexual* in nature.\n\t- His arm was oddly injured. A wide bruise on his forearm and a bandage around his hand. Claiming to have tripped and smashed a bottle.\n\t- Lord Septurn had no apparent knowledge of the evenings events. Both the broken chandelier and the corpse were surprises to him.\n- In a fury, Curtis blamed Grant for the evenings events. Asking him how he \"allowed something like this to happen\". Grant dismissed him and invites the group to wait the long night ahead out in the comfort of one of his sitting rooms. A room in which he collapsed onto his chaise lounge. A piece of furniture he seemed essentially glued to.\n\t- Adja didn't approve of the prime suspects leaving the site of the investigation. However, it was Grant's home and her authority only got her so far. She sent two guards along with the group to keep an eye on you.\n- In the quieter sitting room, the group is allowed to decompress and take stock of their situation.\n\t- Mae, Gale and Rhea formed their own little posse. Mae was upset at Curtis for some reason.\n\t- Rione and Grant were keeping to themselves, resting on the lounge. However, Rione seemed to be very fixated on Sherman.\n\t- Curtis couldn't stop pacing, and Bennet seemed keen on giving him something for his nerves. He had apparently brought an [[Alchemy]] kit and was brewing him something.\n- Cyrus and Deimos decided to go investigate the body, while Rozwald continued his drinking. Deimos' odd past had given him ample skills for the task.\n\t- They found a full sized crossbow bolt. The weapon it was fired from would have been too large to conceal.\n\t- The body had also been poisoned. A white froth and a strange smell was found in its mouth. Rozwald's science would have to be employed to uncover more about it.\n\t- Cyrus was intrigues by Deimos' abelites. He asked him about his foresight, and Deimos said that was a question for later.\n- Back in the room, Rozwald was vomiting. The smell drove Curtis from the room. Deimos and Cyrus bumped into him in the hall, and Deimos pursued him in secret.\n\t- Deimos saw Curtis retrieve a knife that he stashed in his sleeve, but was noticed by Curtis soon after.\n- Back in the room, Cyrus asked Bennet to borrow his [[Alchemy]] kit for Rozwald's investigation. Bennet seemed oddly protective of it, but a bit of Cyrus' magic got it out of his cautious hands.\n\t- Rozwald noticed something strange about the kit. Some of the ingredients were mislabeled, and abnormal inclusions for a standard kit.\n- Upon investigating the body, it became clear. Curtis had brought the ingredients to brew a simple, slow acting poison called \"Killer's Fizz\". He seemed to have accidentally dosed Mavis' Cup with it instead of Curtis'. \n\t- Though his intention likely wasn't murder. As the ingredients for the antidote were also in the kit. It seemed Curtis had crashed the party to poison a high ranking noble, then save him. A half-clever plan to gain the favor he seemed in dire need of.\n- Though this wasn't the only secret the body held. It had also been dosed with an alchemical toxin known as \"Suspicionol\". A substance which is essentially the unbound principal of conspiracy. Known for its distinct scent, and its ability to wholistically increase paranoia. Those who ingest it have an increased tendency to form and believe conspiracies.\n- Back in the sitting room, Sherman sensed something odd beneath the house. A writhing. He and Magnus went to investigate. They discovered a room full of [[Warforged]] servants. Sherman had no idea how he sensed them.\n- Magnus and he shared a moment of understanding, but it was interrupted by Rione Elsitor, who was acting very strangely.\n\t- He said that Grant was very *fond* of Sherman's kind.\n- Back in the room, Curtis was losing his mind. The scent of Suspicionol heavy on his breath. He began accusing the party of being hired by Lord Rozwald to stop him from giving his speech. \n- Then he pivoted, assuming that the party had been hired by his uncle to protect him. Accusing Gale and Rhea of going after him to stop his marriage with Mae. Apparently for something to do with the sale of Mechanical Lubricant of all things.\n- Mae then accused him of being intimate with Kalimae, a thing which he seemed genuinely perplexed by. Gale and Rhea attested to seeing the same thing.\n- The passion of the moment came to its apex when the heroes learn of Curtis' real reason for coming to the city. He was going to give an anti-warforged speech on Victory Day, 18th Bell. This provoked a full blown argument involving the whole room.\n- The argument was interrupted by Adja Corsair. She had come to tell the guards that a second body had been found. It then became apparent that the party knew these guards! They weren't guards at all, but undercover guild members. Laizen and Eddoch of The Three Fools.\n- It was an understatement to say something was afoot. As it seemed that *many* things were afoot and our heroes were no closer to discovering who killed Mavis Morp.\n- The body was that of a staff member. Throat slashed, and Jaw smashed. A type of killing commonly used to silence someone who knew something involved in a crime, and preventing most magic from divining information from their corpse. It was assumed this was the staff who had cleaned the dueling sword which now stuck out of Mavis' neck.\n- The Guild revealed their plot to our heroes. Adja, Bax, Collin, and The Three Fools had staged an faux assassination attempt that would hopefully scare Curtis Renaull out of Tenzentak.\n\t- They feared that his \"anti-warforged\" mission would spark a riot. To them, this seemed the best option.\n\t- However Kalimae Sky had spotted the faux assassin, Tardich. He had been the individual chased out during the ball earlier.\n\t- At that moment, Magnus spotted a black cat in a window.\n- Our heroes decided to investigate the chandelier room. A rope had been cut, and it was the one adjacent to the rope which had hung the chandelier above Curtis' head earlier in the night.\n\t- Beyond that, it was the perfect place to have fired the crossbow from.\n\t- Magnus soon learned that Rione Elsitor's Dueling sword had fibers to match the cut rope. The Three Fools were dispatched to make the arrest.\n- Back in the sitting room, Sherman was able to deduce there was something off about Grant's chaise lounge. He and Magnus lifted it to find a crossbow beneath. It's bowstring was stained with blood. \n- It turned out Grant's arm wound was made by a poorly fired crossbow.\n- Grant was arrested for attempted murder. The young, pissed off, and drunken noble made threats at everyone. The games of these nobles were an odd thing. They were like pieces on a grand chessboard. Each was insignificant on their own. However the way they moved, the strategy the represented, was significant. This evening both Mavis' and Grant's pieces had been taken off the table in a bloody exchange. For what purpose, our heroes did not rightly know.\n- The party was thanked and told to go back home. Though questions still remained:\n\t- Where did Rione Elsitor go?\n\t- Who dosed Curtis with Suspicionol?\n\t- And who threw the sword?\n- Out in the rainy street, Magnus spotted the cat. The small creature disappeared under a carriage owned by none other than Kalimae sky.\n- She reminded Magnus that she had warned him, and hinted ominously that our heroes were involved in something much greater than they knew. She assured him he hadn't killed Mavis... she just had to turn out the lights.\n- Kalimae's carriage left Magnus in the rainy streets of Tenzentak, and Magnus caught a glimpse of something. She was not alone in that wagon...\n- **Chapter ends on the terribly early hours of the 17th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.766233363Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-12-The-Ticking-of-Time":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 12 - The Ticking of Time","content":" - **Chapter begins on the criminally early morning of the 17th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n - Our heroes departed the Beast's Ball with more questions than answers. Deimos most of all. He seemed perturbed by something. A knowledge that on the 21st of Spring, Victory Day. At the 18th bell in cliffside square, something bad was going to happen. The very same time Lord Curtis Renaull was to give his speech.\n - Deimos warned his friends of this. They believed him, but they were concerned about the source of this knowledge. \n - They pressured him for information, he only explained that it was like a gut feeling, and that he was somehow keeping them safe by not telling them more.\n - Being unable to get Deimos to open up, the group bedded down for the night, exhausted.\n - Cyrus had reached the precipice of sleep when something rattled within his bag. A peculiar nesting doll with some strange being held inside it. It whispered to Cyrus, telling him that someone at the ball was wearing a \"mask\" and not the kind of mask one would conventionally associate with a masquerade. The nesting doll said it was the same kind of mask Cyrus wore.\n - In the morning, the party awoke after barely enough sleep to find The Three Fools waiting downstairs in the Immarum. They had come to apologize for the chaos of the night prior, assuring the party that they hadn't been comfortable with the plan the Guild had wrapped them up in.\n - They also warned that Rione Elsitor was still at large, and he was the presumed assassin of Lord Mavis Morp.\n - Tardich warned that they weren't the only visitors for them at the tavern that morning. Master Colin Coinge had come as well, and he had brought someone along with him. A man who Tardich had known as a young boy apparently. A good sort, and no stranger to the type of chaos the party often found themselves in.\n - Mallory Bosemann, or Mal for short, was an academic guild member with a prosthetic metal hand. He had been hired by Colin Coinge to accompany our heroes as a sort of eyes and ears in the ongoing 1-5 Potentium Investigation. The circumstances were strange, but apparently this sort of supervision was now the only thing that kept the party out of prison.\n - Mal seemed nice enough. Professional mostly. Though being associated with Colin Coinge painted him in a less than favorable light.\n - The party was reminded by Colin Coinge that on the coming day they would have to take on mop duty. Though, Adja Corsair was able to get their trespassing fines from the night prior waived. \n - Hoping to get it out of the way early, the group headed for the guild. Chapter Frond, ever friendly, greeted the party and seemed to be a friend of Mal's. So much so that he shares drinks occasionally with him and Professor Abby. This gained Mal a modicum of trust from the party.\n - The party soon learned that they could in fact perform their mop duties early, and that Colin Coinge seemed to have mislead them for some reason. They also discovered that they would be conducting these duties along side Bennet Frence. Mal and Bennet also knew each other. Mal's teasing of Bennet garnered him more respect from the group.\n - Splitting off into three groups the party found that their afternoon would not be entirely wasted.\n\t - Magnus, Mal, and Bennet spent their morning scraping bird droppings off of a maintenance balcony near [[Gilligan's Lift]] where they learned a bit about Bennet, the fact that there was a ton of evidence against Master Willem Bellard in the 1-5 Potentium Investigation, and that Colin Coinge was the one who was tasked with looking after all of the [[Warforged]] Bodies after the attack. Mal also realized he had been given a letter for the party. A message, addressed to \"The Uninvited\" from the mysterious fortune teller that simply read \"Well done\".\n\t - Deimos and Sherman were sent to a building called Block 1618 where they found the Office of Master Willem Bellard. Through the keyhole they found and oddly pristine office, save for a window left open. Sherman pressed Deimos further in regards to his odd sense of coming danger. He managed to convince Deimos to meditate on the feeling and Deimos found himself seeing an odd interlocking web of fibers for the briefest of moments. A natural structure that seemed to cover every surface, but most notably Wall'e and himself. Even Sherman had a few on him. The time in Block 1618 concluded with the discovery of a strange, transient, friendly creature that looked like a pitch black one-eye'd slug.\n\t - Cyrus and Rozwald were sent to a nameless warehouse. They had been tasked with cleaning up a crime scene of all things. Apparently someone had broken into it some time ago, got caught, killed three guild members, and fled without stealing anything. Supposedly the suspect was a fellow named Salt. It was an odd robbery as the contents of the Warehouse were very mundane. Nothing of value worth the risk of going after Guild Property. Two pieces of evidence were found. The first, A trail of blood contaminated by \"Principal Overrun\" indicating the perpetrator was doped up on some poorly made, magical substance. The second was a singular crate of rift iron horseshoes that had been target in the ransacking. A present warehouse attendant also said that some of his rift iron materials were going missing.\n - After mop duty, the party decided to see Fox's Hollow to find the locks that belonged to their mysterious keys.\n - It took some time, but eventually they were able to find an old Tabaxi farmer named Leonard Bebother. He brought them to the old, dying town. Supposedly, it paid its taxes to a Lord Stoneshard. There wasn't much reason to go to a place such as Foxes hollow, the town didn't even have a Tavern.\n - Upon arriving, the group was faced with wary locals, and a challenging task. How does one find a lock that goes to a key in a whole town?\n - The group began to contend with the issue when Deimos spotted a tower over the hill upon which the town was built.

The Lumberjack. An old, abandoned tavern on the outskirts of Fox's Hollow.\n - Despite its obvious age, it was relatively well preserved. Save for the gaping hole in its roof, of course. It had the bones of a tavern. Potential.\n - The tavern itself was located on a high hill, overlooking Fox's Hollow. Nearby there was farmland, windmills, the foundations of old structures, and a wide inviting lake. Beyond that, distant views of a neighboring village, and [[Tenzentak]] itself.\n - Our heroes began to explore, discovering a kitchen, a bar, a brewery, apparatum, storage, an office, a garden, a shed, a greenhouse, an apartment, lodging, an art studio, and a whole lot of work to be done.\n - At first, no one said it outright. But as our heroes explored they slowly gravitated towards the idea of making a home here.\n - But a home was not the only thing they discovered. There were secrets hidden in these ruins.\n - Amongst the rubble and dust, they discovered a few things.\n\t - The building was ransacked long ago, and the things that remained were either in ruin or in great need of repair.\n\t - There was a mount for a mechanical pump connected to a massive underground cistern. A cistern they had access to via a trap door in their basement. This cistern seemed to be shared by the small neighborhood that once stood near the tavern. Only one other ladder remains in the cistern. It leads up to a old foundation a few hundred yards from the Lumberjack. A secret passage of sorts.\n\t - At the bottom of the cistern laid a skeleton wearing a pair of magical water walking boots.\n\t - Rozwald noticed some religious symbolism incorporated into The Lumberjack's design. \n\t\t - Arches holding up a strange chimney and a *long walk through the dark* leading to the first floor entry. Symbolism of The [[Zolaen Gods]]. More specifically, [[The Watcher in The Door]].\n\t\t - The Lumberjack's name was also an oddity. Likely named after the profession, it is also the name of a mythic temple associated with [[The Wandering Gods]].\n\t\t - Finally, and most strange of all, was a white symbol of [[The Trinity]] emblazoned into the wooden floor of the building's first level. No larger than a saucer plate, it sat on the ground nearest to the stage. The sigil appeared like a crystalline inlay, but there was no seam indicating any sort of craftsmanship. It was as if the wood itself had become stone.\n\t - The fireplace near the stage had been a later addition to the buildings structure. It seemed to have been built with a greater level of skill than the others. Its odd shape seemed to have been designed to not disturb a cat's preferred perch near the entryway.\n\t - In the apartment there were many landscape paintings of distant places. All of which were created by an artist named Therin.\n\t - Whoever resided in the apartment was well read, and the people who looted the building were not. The study had been left alone. Unfortunately sunlight, mold, insects, and time had left all of the books degraded to the point of no return. But there was a silver lining. Their crumbling state exposed a safe. The home of the second key. Inside, our heroes found a few things.\n\t\t - A sum of 336 gold which they decided to use to help restore the building.\n\t\t - A consecrated rift iron short sword emblazoned with the [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbols of Divinity and Sleep. Holy Slumber.\n\t\t - And the Deed to The Lumberjack.\n\t - Upstairs in the studio were more paintings by Therin. Though there was a single outlier. A haunting image of a black dog on a beach. It was signed by an artist named Fejn. On the back was a written phrase: *There has never been a dreamer who prefers reality*.\n - As our heroes revealed things about this old sleeping tavern, it began to reveal things about them.\n\t - Rozwald scanned the old tavern not only with the intention of exploration, but the discerning mind of an artificer. Those who watched him closely would see his practiced eye. A craftsman aquatinting himself with their newest task. One might think this is not the first time he has tended to the apparatum commonly found in taverns.\n\t - Most telling of all was the reaction of their new friend Mal. Until arriving at The Lumberjack he had been a professional escort of the group. But here in the tavern something changed. Mal quickly made his way behind the bar and began acquainting himself with it. There was a familiarity, a passion in his movements. Unprompted, Mal cooked the party a delicious meal with small means. This seemed to please him.\n - As exciting as their new home was, the party acknowledged they had much to do back in [[Tenzentak]] so they decided to head back.\n - On the road to the city, they were suddenly attacked by assassins. Most of which were amateur thugs, but one was a skilled killer. The assassins seemed focused on Rozwald. This enraged our heroes, causing them to use more lethal means than usual. Mal proved to be an efficient and cold killer himself.\n - The assassins were found with a span read communication of a similar nature to the one that Deimos had found back in Lord Rozwald's office. Rozwald had to contend with the fact that his family was likely trying to have him killed, and he had no idea why. Worst of all, the would probably continue to do so, sending more and more proficient assassins if they continued to fail.\n - The party made it to Tenzentak where Magnus was able to finally meet Ul'Brek. An old wiseman who Persephone Drone said could help him. Ul'Brek was strange and seemed keen on not giving Magnus what he wanted. He instead told Magnus to walk his own path, and gave him a piece of charcoal in a fancy box. Deimos and Mal saw that the item was a mundane hunk of burnt wood from his fireplace. But Ul'Brek lied to Magnus, telling him it was the heart of a tree, burnt by a lightning strike.\n - Ul'Brek sent Magnus on his way, but not before telling him to keep an eye on his new friend Mal. Apparently Ul'Brek had seen something dangerous behind the Mage's eyes.\n - **Chapter ends on the early evening on the 17th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.766233363Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-14-Ones-Own-Story":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 14 - One's Own Story","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early evening on the 17th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had returned to the Bladehammer Guild to find it busier than ever. The Victory Day celebrations mixed with the chaos surrounding the 1-5 Potentium crisis had the courtyard packed with guild members.\n- The surge of guild events were sparked by an upcoming competition, The Tournament of the Brave. A large scale combat competition.\n- Our heroes, especially Magnus, were very intrigued by this prospect. Not only would it be a good bit of sport, but an effective way to make one's self known.\n- To admit, they had to have a Guild Mind throw in their lot with them. They went to the obvious and only choice: Abacus Oleander.\n- Old Abby was thrilled to see them, and enquired about their recent escapades. He was also quite excited to see that Mallory Bosemann had made his way amongst his new favorite band of heroes.\n- He covertly asked if it was alright to talk about the [[Warforged]] recovered from [[The Grand Nothing]], and the related dream in front of Mal. Though it seemed Mal hadn't been granted that privilege yet. That mystery was left for another day.\n- They then discussed the tournament. Old Abby seemed both concerned an honored at the prospect of being their sponsor. They filled out their entrance form as \"The Street Dogs\" and submitted it to Chapter frond in hopes to make it in as one of the 8 teams in The First Ring.\n- Apparently they had a good chance as they were somewhat *controversial* due to them being suspect in the 1-5 Potentium Investigation. Supposedly, a board of merchants and sponsors select the teams, and these money hungry nobles only care who attracts a crowd.\n- They were to return the next morning at 7am. Not able to find a place to stay in the packed city, Magnus led a jog back to The Lumberjack to camp out for the night. A sort of warm-up for the coming tournament. The Street Dogs displayed a spectrum of stamina.\n- Continuing the exercise while making some progress on their new tavern, the group decided to begin tackling the pile of rubble in the basement. They found more than a workout amongst the debris.\n- Clinging to the fallen stones, our heroes discovered pages of an unknown script preserved in splattered wax. Mal, a gifted arcanist, attempted to decode the text using a reliable spell. To his shock, it didn't work.\n- Spells such as this are a mosaic of language and cypher. Designed to decode anything written in known word and logic. When a successful casting of this nature results in no gained information, it can mean one of two things. Either it is a unique cypher that does not follow the logical pattern of any known cryptography, or it is not based in any known language. Both are exceptionally rare, and significant. The latter especially so.\n- Baffled and thrilled by this odd discovery, our heroes began sifting through the rubble with keen eyes.\n- There were other pages preserved in wax. Recipes, ledgers, fiction, and other mundane writings. But soon they found another fragment of the odd script. Then another. In a quarter of an hour they found a half dozen of these odd pages.\n- Then they found one written in common. The paper, and quality of line were the same, but the text was legible. It was the journal of a disturbed individual, scorning their brother and rambling about visions of a black dog on a beach.\n- But the discoveries didn't stop there. Their sifting through the pile had caused stones to fall away from the covered wall. A wall that featured an oddly perfect arched door that made one's skin prickle with a fear of the unknown. The hunt for more pages was set aside for this new mystery. The space in front of the door was rapidly cleared away. \n- Then the debate began. Would our heroes open this strange door, or leave it shut? Curiosity won out.\n- The turning of the Third Key in the Door was like the turning of the world itself. Beyond it, a wall of cobbled stones. The door had been blocked from the other side.\n- The anticlimactic result left the group puzzled, but they soon noticed something. The geology of the stones was wrong, and not from the local area. The stones were warmer than the basement of the Lumberjack. More  fear, and curiosity stimulated another bout of deliberation. Eventually Cyrus and Magnus chipped away a finger sized hole through the mortar of the wall.\n- From this space, music poured through. Quiet and wild. Too far in to turn back they sent Mal's familiar, Slug into the gap. What Slug discovered was an odd basement filled with barrels and boxes. It was as if it were the basement of a functional, regularly used tavern.\n- Amongst the storage, there was an esoteric orchestra instruments strewn about. Being played by magical ropes and fibrous sacks.\n- Then Slug spotted it. A window looking out at a beautiful, winding costal city and a sky filled with airships. [[Reach Run]].\n- Suddenly a glass cup was placed over Slug by a crazed old man. Slug quickly returned to Mal through teleportation.\n- The odd old man, who called himself Razmodius the Rope Wizard, spoke to them through hole in the wall. He was friendly, but the situation was far too strange for anyone to take their guard down.\n- The door connected their tavern to the basement of The Sheh'Sheraan in Reach Run across the world. A portal of astounding potency. The Sheh'Sheraan's owners knew of the door, which had been locked until now. They feared what may come through it, so it was sealed. Apparently they left Razmodius (AKA Raz) to watch it. In what little they saw, the arcane \"rope wizard\" seemed more than capable of the task.\n- Then they spoke formally with a much more sane person on the other side. Morza, the Tavernkeeper. A stern old lady who was wary of them at first, but slowly accepted our heroes story. The groups decided to leave the door closed for the time being and sort the oddness out at a later date.\n- Not knowing what to make of their discovery, our heroes bedded down for some rest before the coming early morning.\n- In Rozwald's slumber, another dream came to him. Once again he was visited by Egan. His father's avuncular colleague. In it, Egan asked Rozwald what he wanted despite all the chaos of his life. Roz simply answered \"to belong\". Egan seemed pleased with this answer, and told him to not lose sight of that.\n- As the dream began to give way to smoke, Egan left Roz with a few final words. Rozwald's father was up to something. More than just simple Rift Iron mining. Some scheme that was put people in great danger. A lot of people. Rozwald's dream faded as he awoke, and Sherman was left standing in the space where Egan had been.\n- **Chapter begins on the early morning of the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.766233363Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-15-Mixed-Reaction":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 15 - Mixed Reaction","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early morning on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes set off early in a hopeful march towards the Guild Courtyard with hopes to be chosen to compete in The First Ring. The entry level fighting competition in The Tournament of the Brave.\n- Tensions were high amongst prospective competitors, and there were *many* hopeful teams in the square.\n- Our heroes were chosen amongst eight other teams. Each selected by a board of sponsors and merchants. Supposedly teams were picked based on how they will draw a crowd. The Street Dogs were likely chosen due to their controversial connection to the 1-5 Potentium investigation.\n- For the same reason, Coinge's Lot was chosen. The team had been selected and sponsored by none other then Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge himself. The investigator who named the party as suspects in his investigation of the train robbery.\n- The Street Dogs were provisioned and sequestered within a lounge for the day. Their only connection to the outside world beyond their fights would be Professor Abby.\n- The old, jovial guild mind met you at your upper floor room. Upright, and unbound by his wheelchair. The Professor was sporting auto-mail legs. An apparatum that granted the paraplegic man the ability to walk.\n- The change, and the manner Old Abby was carrying himself with sparked a question. Why was the professor treated unfairly by some amongst the guild?\n- Old Abby explained to you that he had a reputation. A tendency to explore anything an everything. His need for discovery outweighed his caution. His tenacity had gotten him into a lot of trouble. He originally sought out the guild in hopes to find like-minded people, or at least friends who could withstand his bad luck.\n\t- Specifically in relation to the tournaments, his Lot never even made it past the first round. Old Abby was bad luck.\n- The Professor explained his role in the coming day. He would be able to relay you information about the fights as he saw them. Unfortunately, your place within the bracket made you the first team to compete in every iteration of the arena. You would be going in blind.\n- You were brought down to a facility below the arena, bound to your Blood Well and broken off into pairs. Each pair was sent to an elevator.\n- The sky above the area was blinding as your platforms raised. The crowds were a deafening blend of cheers and boos. A mixed reaction. Sherman in particular was a target for negativity.\n- You found yourselves in an obstacle course like space. The crowd, a safe distance away up steeply slanted walls.\n- Amongst the audience you spotted some notable faces.\n\t- Scattered in the general seating you noticed Cliff Guntry, a familiar looking fortuneteller dressed in purple, and a tiefling man who looked a bit like Johnny Dogs.\n\t- In the Guild Pit you noticed Chapter Frond, Spinner, Persephone Drone, and a confused looking Bennet Frence.\n\t- Amongst the finer seats, reserved for guild minds you saw Master Willem Bellard, Master Colin Coinge, and of course Old Abby.\n\t- Then there was the most dramatic section. Reserved for VIPs. Within you saw the two most politically powerful figures in the city for the first time. Lady Helseena Trodak, [[Alderian Seat]] of Tenzentak and Helg Corsair, Guild Master of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. Next to Helg were his two twin offspring, Adja and Bax. You also spotted the esteemed guest Haith Nallian sitting next to a huge, imposing, empty chair. At the far edge of the VIP Section, you was Lord Curtis Renaull accompanied by Lady Kalimae Sky of all people. As strange as the sight was, the man sitting behind them was far more distracting. Still as a statue, and wearing a pristine, white body covering, the man had a distinctive silver mask that caught the sun like a sword.\n- The fight began with an explosion of movement. Your competitors, Falk's Six, proved to be admirable foes.\n- The arena itself was a participant in the fight, filled with traps and secrets to explore.\n\t- The party discovered toppling towers\n\t- A secret passage in the bottom of the central pit\n\t- And a key that damaged the opposing side's Blood Well.\n- The fight consisted of skilled martial arts, the clever use of spells, a giant tortle, and mind controlling magic employed by both sides of the fight.\n- Our heroes emerged victorious after Rozwald snuck out a secret hatch and blasted away the last of the opposing side's Blood Well.\n- Whatever haters of yours remained in the audience were drowned out by cheers. The metal faced man in the VIP section was particularly watchful of your group. And your foes proved to be mostly good-sports.\n- Celebrations were had in the lounge, and congratulations were given by Old Abby who told you he'd report back on the other teams before your next fight.\n- Amongst the excited chatter of victory a small, important moment occurred. Our heroes spoke of their group's future, and their tavern. They spoke of it with Mallory included.\n- **Chapter ends on the early afternoon on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.766233363Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-16-Underdogs":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 16 - Underdogs","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early afternoon on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had just won their preliminary bout of The First Ring fighting tournament\n- The comradery of victory drew our heroes even closer to one another. Mallory included.\n- Unfortunately for Mal, this seemed to trigger something within him. A shifting sensation. A motion only felt on the higher, fourth dimension of time. A daunting and familiar feeling.\n- While frightening, the moment was shaken off to make room for present matters. Their coming fight.\n- The Street Dogs discussed strategy as Sherman paced. On the exterior, he was anxiously voicing his fears about the fight. Though on the inside it seemed he was disturbed by the public's negative reaction to him.\n- Old Abby returned before your next fight and caught you up on the latest news.\n\t- You'd be fighting the Red Band, a crowd favorite\n\t- and Coinge's Lot had advanced as well\n- The second fight was soon under way. Ballistae, powder kegs, and a slippery substance near the well were the latest additions to the arena.\n- Magnus, moving with something to prove, was the first to activate the well's key, giving our heroes an immediate advantage over their foes.\n- This theme maintained through the whole of the fight as The Street Dogs crushed the Red Band.\n\t- Rozwald making advantage of his natural poison.\n\t- Magnus toppling, no, *throwing* a tower at a foe.\n\t- and Sherman ending the bout with an impressive body slam.\n- Back in the lounge, Sherman was even more nervous than before. Fortunately, his neurotic spiral was stymied by the arrival of Old Abby, giving yet more congratulations.\n- During all this, Cyrus' curiosity was getting the better of him. He expressed a desire to sneak out of their sequestration, explore the VIP seating, and get an early look at the next arena.\n- The rest of The Street Dogs, from Cyrus' perspective, did and admirable job of emphatically illustrating the \"cons\" of his plan. Fortunately for Cyrus, his plan was more than capable of bearing the weight of a few \"cons\".\n- While Old Abby detailed the attack patterns of Coinge's lot, Cyrus slipped out into the corridor unseen. Adopting the appearance of a forgettable noble lord.\n- Cyrus was able to get to the VIP section with little resistance where he found Lady Kalimae Sky accompanied by Lord Curtis Renaull. Sitting near them was the mysterious man in a Silver Mask.\n- Cyrus was able to overhear Lord Renaull denying the rumors that he had come to [[Tenzentak]] to make a name for himself in an attempt to work his way up the chain of his noble family. An opportunity supposedly made possible by his uncle's impending demise. A demise that Curtis claimed to be dubious.\n- The young lord told Kalimae of of a dream. One where he sat beneath one of [[The Moons]]: Luna, the Fated. A vision in which he read the shifting of its surface. Telling him to save Tenzentak from the impending threat of Automata. \n- After the noble couple's conversation wandered back to mundane topics, Cyrus was evicted from his stolen seat. He opted to take the empty one next to Lady Kalimae Sky. Lady Sky's reaction to him was somewhere between ominous, and entirely mundane. Did she know he was Cyrus in disguise?\n- Before Cyrus could learn more, he was interrupted by the mysterious, soft spoken, silver masked man. Gideon Gain.\n- **Chapter ends on the mid-to-late afternoon on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-17-Fight-Dirty":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 17 - Fight Dirty","content":"- **Chapter begins on the mid-to-late-afternoon on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Cyrus couldn't resist the allure of sneaking out, and had managed to get himself seated between Kalimae Sky and Gideon Gain.\n- Gain toyed with Cyrus for a bit, but eventually hinted that he knew who he was. Apparently Kalimae's cat had been keeping watch on The Street Dogs for the entire day.\n- The exact purpose of her surveillance you are not sure of, but Gideon said that they were merely \"protecting their investments\".\n- Though Gideon wasn't offended or concerned by Cyrus' antics. If anything, he seemed amused.\n- Their discussion becoming more open with Cyrus' identity known between them, they discussed the tournament and the hidden connection between Master Colin Coinge and Rozwald.\n- Apparently, Coinge had created an upset in the field of artificery. Something that would \"resolve\" the issues most of society had with warforged. Gideon was vague, but hinted at creating a sort of \"need\" for immortal machines. A method of control.\n- Cyrus pressed for more but was interrupted by the next fight beginning. A bout in which Coinge's Lot swept the floor with their foe. The crux of their strategy seemed to be protecting their star mage, Kael Starstrider, and allowing him to demolish opponents with a giant, magical hand formed of sand and stone.\n- At the end of the fight, two of Kael's opponents were carried out on medical cots. Well wishes were shared by Conan Cacergy, the arena's announcer, and the twist for the next fight was shared. Hidden treasures and a perilous twist to the beginning of the match.\n- Soon after the announcement, chaos broke out amongst the stands. Apparently there was a second terrorist attack during the previous match, and a major bridge had been destroyed. In response, Master Colin Coinge was having all suspects of his investigation arrested.\n- Back in the lounge where the rest of the street dogs were naive to the greater situation at hand, a... clever distraction was set. A close bathroom door mixed with magically produced sounds of defecation. This proved a suitable stand in for Cyrus as guards came to arrest you, but opted to wait for Cyrus to finish his \"business\". A delaying tactic at best, but luckily it was all seen by Lady Skye's cat.\n- Cyrus, in a bind, found himself being lectured by the mysterious noblewoman. Fortunately, she needed this fight to continue. An enigmatic claim similar to her admission of having something to do with the mayhem at The Beast's Ball a few nights prior. As curious as it was, Cyrus was in no place to dig deeper. He had to get back to his lounge, and soon.\n- Begging a favor of Lady Skye, Cyrus found himself teleported into the closed bathroom of the lounge. This wasn't done for free. Lady Skye was keen on him \"owing her one\".\n- The tournament was suspended and the suspects were then taken to the dungeon. But *only* the suspects. Mallory Boseman was not guilty of anything more than getting caught in the crossfire.\n- Down in the prisons, belongings were revoked and [[Dimeritium]] bands were placed on Cyrus and Rozwald. As they were being led to their jail, a stone basement carved into the very edge of The Grand Nothing's cliffs, Sherman sensed something. The very same feeling he felt in the basement of Septurn Manor during The Beast's Ball.\n- The majority of The Bladehammer Guild's dungeon were occupied by The Alshor. A self defined peaceful community of warforged. All of which Sherman could somehow feel. Each was like a ribbon in the wind, save for one who was more akin to a tangled knot.\n- However, those weren't the only neighbors down below.\n\t- Lord Grant Septurn was there. Pleased to see his enemies brought down to his level, the young lord was thrilled for a chance at being a great displeasure. Apparently he was working out a plea deal. A contract in which he was sharing information from his family's extensive, secret spy network. Supposedly the biggest in the city.\n\t- Master Willem Bellard himself was locked up as well. The seemingly antagonistic artificer was soon found to be a fairly reasonable fellow. A fellow who was not in fact anti-warforged, merely anti-everyone. His past run in with Sherman wasn't rude because Sherman was a [[Warforged]], it was because he was dressed like a sheep! The old artificer was raised on a wool farm and apparently hated the creatures. He lacked a [[Dimeritium]] band of his own because he suffered from a Curiosity. Heavy Metal poisoning, [[Dimeritium]] poisoning to be exact. This prevented him from using most forms of magic, and required a great deal of regular treatment. This regular treatment was actually the very alibi which removed him from being the prime suspect in Master Colin Coinge's investigation.\n\t\t- He also spoke of the acid which had brought him under suspicion. Apparently it would be an absurd thing to create in the volume that the [[Warforged]] Rebels seemed to possess. Necessitating a suspicious amount of salt, water, and simple acid.\n\t- Sharing the same cell was a barely conscious drunkard. Albus Borg, the guard who had been accompanying Lord Curtis Renaull on his train ride to [[Tenzentak]] when our heroes first encountered him. Apparently this individual had been let go, and used his payment to waste away in the taverns and brothels of the city. A relatively useless person, but he did mention the investigators asked a great deal of questions about the party. Also... he was pretty sure there was a man with a [[Saen]] accent present during his interrogation. Presumably Tardich of The Three Fools who were suspiciously absent from the dungeon.\n\t- Two of the Warforged were also willing to converse. Azmodan, a wizened, paternal automaton, and his younger companion Coop. Coop seemed a little off, and was the source of the strange \"tangled\" impression Sherman had noticed. He also had a tendency to call people \"shit-birds\" similar to how X12 called people \"dog-fuckers\". Neither of them were very knowledgeable about the greater situation it seemed. They had been in the dungeon for the last 7 days. Though Azmodan did mention other communities like The Alshor in [[Zessgorn]] and [[Ka'thoor]]. As well as two that were a little similar, but more controlled (due to the high concentration of Artificers) in [[Rails]] and [[Deepspell]]. \n- Outside of the dungeon, Mal was caught up in the whirl of people that were responding to the attack.\n- In the chaos, he made his way over to \"The Hall\" and sought Master Coinge. The only logical step he could come up with at the moment.\n- He found them in a grand conference room, but was forced to wait outside in a seating area with lots of important looking individuals. Though he could hear through the grand door.\n- The argument had two sides:\n\t- Those in favor of Guild Mind Master Coinge's actions.\n\t- And those who thought he was a self-serving narcissist capitalizing on a disaster.\n- The disaster itself was notably destructive, though few had perished. Many were injured, and there had been a shockwave that shattered a great deal of windows. At the center of blast, the middle section of a rift bridge was completely vaporized. Somehow only four people were killed. Likely because the attackers made themselves intentionally known prior to setting off the 1-5 Potentium explosive.\n- Fortunately, the group of high ranking guild members managed to quickly decide upon a coordinated response to the attack. They then moved on the their secondary topic: the suspended Tournament of the Brave. A long-winded, and heated discussion.\n- Eventually, Mal was called upon and introduced as the individual hired to accompany the other, suspect Street Dogs. Inside the room he saw the two sides of the discussion:\n\t- Master Colin Coinge's side consisting exclusively of Kerketh mages. Arguing that The Street Dogs were too close to the crime to let out in a time as dire as this.\n\t- On The Street Dogs side, consisting of The Corsair Twins, Guild Mind Persephone Drone, and of course Old Abby, it was argued that Coinge had no just cause for arresting them. They claimed he had done it in an attempt to get the only competition his lot would face disqualified. The tournament was not only an honored tradition, but a legitimate means for organizing their guild. Impulsive alterations to it was wrong, and set a bad precedent.\n\t- In the center of it all was the tired, Guild Master Helg Corsair. Likely buzzed from the day's festivities, Corsair did his best to stay level headed.\n- Corsair asked Mal about his role in all of this. It became quickly evident that Coinge had not gone through the proper channels to hire him. The act was odd to say the least. it could have endangered Mal, or possibly had some more secretive motive behind it.\n- When Mal produced the 1-5 Potentium detector he had been given, a device that supposedly worked through altered, and amplified magnification, it sparked confusion on some of the group's faces.\n- Mal was then told to take a seat as a flock of lawyers, the individuals he had shared the waiting room with, entered the chamber. There were 11 in total. Surprisingly three had been sent to defend The Street Dogs. A fat, sloppy human man, a Tall thin elf man, and a grim faced human woman. No one knew who sent them, and no one asked.\n- After a long bout of spewed legal jargon, one of Kerketh's lawyers produced three documents. Two of which were the Guild Tickets of Cyrus and Sherman. Both of which were apparently counterfeit. Fortunately, Corsair was not perturbed by this. According to him a lot of people join the guild through fake tickets. Why would they turn away a huge portion of prospective heroes?\n- The other document was one directly relating to Mal. According to the lawyer, Mallory Boseman was a convert of another organization. [[The University]]. Though he was not a student, or something of similar station. Mallory Boseman was a solider of the West's Military Underworld. Operating under a figure known as Dairo The Hunter. \n\t- While the document marked him a convert, the lawyers claimed that a solider of his kind was not one who respected borders, or other masters.\n- Mal, blindsided, tried to defend himself. Fortunately Old Abby was there to vouch for him. The protective professor refuted the claim and stomped out of the room with Mal.\n- In the hallway, Old Abby took the \"detector\" and broke it open. It was suspicious to him as potentium wasn't magnetic. He discovered that it wasn't a detector at all, but a tracker. Colin Coinge had been following our heroes' every move.\n- This, paired with the rest of the poor optics around Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge, was enough for Corsair. He removed Mal from Coinge's service. Removed Coinge from the investigation, and set The Street Dogs free. For now at least. They were still discussing things, but they'd fight their final round.\n- While Colin Coinge seemed to have made a bad call, he was still a clever man. He may have gotten away with it if not for Mallory Boseman's honest heart. The arcanist had lost the chance at the second half of his promised payment from Master Coinge, but he had gained something of much greater worth. Friends.\n- Back in their lounge, our heroes caught each other up to date. They were suspicious of many things by now, but had more pressing matters. The First Ring.\n- Our heroes entered the arena for a final time, much later than was originally scheduled. Waiting for them was an audience burning with passion, a sky filled with stars, and one cage that didn't open.\n- **Chapter ends two hours after sunset on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-18-The-First-Ring":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 18 - The First Ring","content":" - **Chapter begins on two hours after sunset on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n - Our heroes entered the arena for the final time during the Tournament of the Brave, unfortunately Deimos, Sherman, and Wall'e were confined to a cage at the start of the match.\n - Coinge's lot proved to be fearsome foes, and Kael Starstride lived up to his title of \"The Savant\". The young mage was somehow capable of casting two complex spells simultaneously.\n - Around the arena were treasure chests packed with surprises. A crown that controlled a giant golem, a clockwork drone that was armed with a stunning device, and a chest that wasn't a chest at all, but a mimic.\n - The fight was a flurry of spells, drama, and roving hazards.\n\t - The equipment was fought over constantly, and persuaded to fight for both sides at different times during the match.\n\t - The audience, which had been riled up by a day's worth of festivities, delays, and a terrorist attack broke into a rage. A clay cup was thrown into the arena, targeted at Sherman, and a fight erupted amongst a fifth of the stands.\n\t - Cyrus recognized that one of the arena's chests was a lesser [[Mimic]] before falling into its trap. He was somehow able to whisper something to this creature's feeble mind, and convince it to defend Deimos. Or rather, savagely attack Elowen Ferric.\n\t - most dastardly, Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge, shameless as he'd proved himself to be, tried to tamper with the ongoing match. Fortunately, there was already one person who saw themselves as The Street Dog's rival. Bennet Frence was not going to give that position up so easily. Each time Coinge tried to exercise his Vizir on the match, Bennet opposed it with his own.\n - The Bloodwells were pushed to their absolute maximum, but towards the end of the match Mallory had gotten the better of Kael, breaking his concentration and allowing Rozwald for find and opening. Kael was separated from Jaxon, and Mal capitalized on it.\n - Mal had given slug a magical waterskin and had his familiar squeeze its immense volume out in one single motion. Right above Kael's head.\n - Mal froze the water into a giant chunk, and crushed Kael beneath it. Winning the match and proving himself the more superior wizard.\n - The crowd was an uproar of elation and outrage as our heroes were honored as the victors of the Tournament. Overcoming odds, abuses of power, and Old Abby's curse.\n - Magnus spoke to the crowd, calling for aide to [[The Ward]], and peace amongst man and machine.\n - In the reception chamber, our heroes received congratulations from the Professor Abacus himself, and the rewards of victory. Not only did they win their trophy and prize money (one thousand gold pieces), but gifts from the greater community.\n\t - Deimos and Magnus received a formal invitation to meet with the head of the Gilded Heart Mercenaries faction, Guild Mind Mandreg Roald.\n\t - Mal and Cyrus received a cryptic scroll case that only held a piece of paper that read \"6 1 2\", and a few coins. One gold, one silver, and two copper.\n\t - There was also a gift from Albojo's wares. A bag of holding containing potions, firebombs, and an artificer's schema that explained the reproduction of said firebombs.\n\t - Six hundred gold pieces were gained from House Goa. The very same noble house from which Lady Gale Goa hailed from.\n\t - A warforged arm with a gas propelled hand that can be launched many feet out and reeled-in via a metal cable was sent for Sherman. Gifted by an anonymous patron. \n\t - Finally, a boarding pass for Sherman. A one way ticket to [[Rails]]. An anonymous dissident's way of saying \"Get out of my city\".\n - In the reception chamber, Mallory approached Old Abby and spoke to him about the leaking of his conversion documentation back from when he'd joined the guild. The professor apologized profusely, admitting he was unaware that sealed documents of that nature could emerge in an investigation. While the conversation smoothed things out, it didn't change the fact that Mal's secret was now known by some of the party's enemies. Perhaps the claims surrounding Old Abby's aura of \"bad luck\" aren't entirely baseless.\n - Before our heroes could get too deep into their celebrations, a visitor sought out our heroes. Master Coinge himself.\n - Coinge's perpetual smile congratulated them on their win. While his words were friendly, his actions were not. Coinge refused to shake Sherman's hand, and stormed out of the room.\n - **Chapter end  on late on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466***","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-19-Lit-Fuse":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 19 - Lit Fuse","content":"- **Chapter begins late on the 18th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had won The First Ring, and all of the spoils that came with\n- The group was informed that they were obligated to join the celebrations at The Sheathed Anvil Tavern\n- But before heading over, there were some preliminary discussions regarding the strange letter sent to Mal and Cyrus. Our heroes realized the coinage sent with was exact change paid when checking for incoming messages at an [[Adjunct]]. Likely the 3 numbers, 6-1-2, were the Adjunct's identifier.\n- On the way to the sheathed anvil, Deimos could only think of the terrible doom, and the thing that lay behind a hidden door.\n- At the tavern our heroes found an overflow of celebrations. The bar, and its patrons had bled out into the streets. Creating a sort of mini campus for drinking.\n- The patrons welcomed the party and celebrated them as victors.\n- Many familiar faces were encountered amongst the guild members.\n\t- Bennet Frence\n\t- Kael Starstride\n\t- an Laizen of The Three Fools\n- Cyrus managed to listen into some gossip at Laizen's table. Hearing about:\n\t- Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge now being on the outs with **The Bladehammer Guild** and **Kerketh Academy**. Supposedly his invention was the sort that would take over a market, and ruin business for all.\n\t- Apparently Guild Mind Master Willem Bellard was still being held at the guild for some reason.\n\t- Supposedly it was The Guild who ordered the 1-5 Potentium in the first place. A dangerous act, and of questionable motive for an institution who aims to make a better world. According to one of Laizen's artificer friends \"people often do strange things at Belzan Tower\" and it wasn't worth worrying about.\n\t- Talks of the empty chair adjacent to Haith, The Inheritor of Fire. People suspect [[The Word of Fire]] himself is inside the city. A deific figure. Apparently [[Wordbearers]] are so potent in their power it can induce terrible and beautiful sensations. Those who meet them describe them as [[Gods]].\n\t- Finally, and most surprisingly, the remaining 1-5 Potentium had apparently been *returned* to The Bladehammer Guild! Surrendered to The Hall's front desk after the tournament.\n- Upstairs there was a VIP section reserved for guild minds and nobility. A less celebratory atmosphere, but the party was still honored here. More as a novelty than anything else. Familiar attendants were:\n\t- Lady Gale Goa and Lady Rhea Stoneshard\n\t- Lord Curtis Renaull and Lady Kalimae Sky\n\t- Gideon Gain, who was asleep. Apparently due to a side effect of a drug he takes.\n\t- And Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge who was accompanied by the mysterious purple fortune teller.\n- The nobility were as scheming as ever\n\t- Lady Gale Goa accepted Magnus' thanks and hinted that she may have a use for the party in the future\n\t- Gideon Gain and Kalimae Sky toyed with Cyrus some more.\n\t- Mal managed to catch Colin Coinge off guard, potentially maintaining a business relationship.\n\t- And finally, the transient fortuneteller gave Mal an envelope for the party. It contained a single tarot card: The Tower. The first card that had been drawn for the party when their fortune had been read.\n- The party reconvened and there were aspersions cast towards The Three Fools. The party decided to speak to Laizen and see if anything could be discovered.\n- Throughout the encounter, Laizen seemed genuinely pleased to see the group, but there was an odd sadness to him. It was clear something between him and his two close friends was wrong.\n\t- When asked about the 1-5 potentium investigation, he seemed genuinely disturbed that the party was made suspects and arrested while The Three Fools were not.\n\t- He claimed that his friends were back at their apartment, resting up for the next day's match.\n\t- Our heroes walked home most of the way with Laizen. Mal and Cyrus tailed him to his home where they discovered Tardich was in fact at home, sleeping. However, Eddoch was missing.\n- Back at the Lumberjack, the party bedded down for the night where another of Rozwald's disturbing dreams occurred. However this was one was different, as the rest of our heroes were in the dream as well. In one way or another.\n\t- It was a feast at Rozwald Manor. Uncomfortably warm and awkward. There were other guests at the table besides our heroes. Colin Coinge and an unknown drow man. Egan Alzby were there, as usual. Though he lay dead on his own plate of food.\n\t- Hanging above Lord Rozwald was a strange painting of [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. Burning and framed behind a grand dragon being killed by some sword wielding warrior.\n\t- The meal itself was by far the most disturbing element to the dream. Two inedible roasts. The warforged body you had recovered from The Grand Nothing, and Sherman's body.\n\t- Clenched in the hand of the recovered warforged was the same scrap of paper found in [[The Grand Nothing]], but its surface was distorted and impossible to read\n- Upon waking, our heroes acknowledged they had experienced a second shared dream. Magnus checked the drawing, which appeared normally.\n- But when he held it up to the sun, colored light was scattered throughout The Lumberjack as if it were a prism.\n- **Chapter ends early on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-2-Legs":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 2 - Legs","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early morning of the 12th of Spring, 4466**\n- Arrival at Tenzentak\n- Quite the big deal train was attacked. Word was sent ahead to the city and your train was met with a swarming crowd at the station.\n- Laizen gave you some advice and did his best to maneuver our heroes into a favorable position.\n\t- Being so close to the crime made them suspect, and things would be easier for them the closer they were associated with [[The Bladehammer Guild]].\n\t- Laizen provided a distraction and allowed for our heroes to slip into the city\n- [[Tenzentak]] is a marvel of a place. It is tall and magnificent city overflowing with activity like:\n\t- The chaotic bustle of trade\n\t- Crowds of incoming people. Importing things in prep for victory day. An important day within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]'s [[Calendar]]\n\t- Long, elegant and high bridges that spanned over the hidden Low City\n\t\t- A place divided from [[Tenzentak]] Proper by the [[Rift Smog]] Filters\n\t- Ridiculous actors in the streets, putting on silly and promiscuous show involve magic and bare skin retelling the story of [[Zol]]'s [[Origin]]\n\t\t- A clear mark of your presence in The Free Cities\n- Arrival at [[The Bladehammer Guild]].

Guild Members of the [[Kerketh Academy]] Sub-faction\n\t- Bennet Frence - A low ranking Guild Member and snooty noble elf\n\t- Master Bellard - A mean looking, busy-body old human. A master artificer and guild mind.\n- Master Bellard seemed keen on precuring help for some duty, when Bennet asked if our heroes would be suitable. The notion was meet with a scoff and a disgusted sneer at Sherman.\n- Our heroes were instead made to be \"Legs\". A notion which seemed funny concept to Bennet.\n- Apparently being legs meant serving Abacus Oleander, a Double Amputee [[Dragonborn]] Guild Mind. Once a professor at Kerketh. \n- Old Abby proved to be a very friendly individual with a seemingly bad reputation, despite his kindness\n\t- He utilizes a wheelchair, an archaic contraption for a skilled arcanist.\n- Some people call him \"Professor\", but he did not present himself that way. In fact he seems to try and deter people from using the title.\n- In searching for work for you, he seemed unimpressed with the tasks he had at hand. Then, in a moment of inspiration he asked our heroes if they could keep a secret.\n- Given quest to venture into [[The Grand Nothing]] to retrieve lost Kerketh Equipment following a distress beacon.\n\t- A piece of salvage that he should not technically be in possession of.\n\t- Though he seemed certain it may contain information about flora and fauna out in The Grand Nothing that could aid the famines which plagued the land.\n\t- In Kerketh hands, that information may be used to turn a profit. In his hands, that information could be freely distributed.\n- The beacon was emitted by a [[Warforged]]. He drew a sketch of it for you, and it matched exactly to the one seen in the dream shared by our heroes.\n- Before setting of to purchase supplies, you were warned of a sandstorm.\n- Shopping at rift top square\n\t- Deimos' premonition of something happening in the square in the coming week.\n- Chocolate, Coffee, and Rats for brunch.\n- A posted bounty for Aleksander Salt, a Orcish man of grey skin and a single tusk was found by Cyrus.\n- During your morning, our heroes began to notice the outer-most edges of secrets amongst their group\n\t- Cyrus carried a pleasant scent that no one could agree upon\n\t- Deimos knows something‚Ä¶ and doesn't seem keen on explaining himself\n\t- The Nobleman Grung you are with is broke, and is slowly turning into smoke\n\t- Magnus is not leading the life he should be as a [[Stormblessed]]\n\t- And Sherman's brain holds flashes of frightening traumatic memories, and he claims that he can dream despite being a Warforged.\n- Set off on your Journey\n- Met Chapter Frond, the Upper Lift Attendant\n\t- Warned of a sandstorm, again\n\t- Granted equipment tokens for:\n\t\t- a Drift Spiker\n\t\t- and a Flatpan [[Skimmer]]\n- Saw [[Gilligan's Lift]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]\n\t- During their descent, a massive bird attacked the lift.

Mal felt an odd remembrance towards these colors. Shapes emerged in the patterns of light when manipulating the page, but nothing was gleaned from it.\n- The party then went off towards the city in hopes to consult Old Abby on a few things. On the way there they encountered the latest addition to the coming victory day festivities. Kites, fireworks, and ferro-illumic good luck charms. The city was growing busier still.\n- The party told the professor about their suspicions towards The Three Fools, who had been selected to compete in the second ring that day. Old Abby seemed to think that was preposterous, and urged you to stop your meddling and enjoy the festival.\n- Old Abby was questioned about the 1-5 Potentium once again. The party asked him what he knew about the substances acquisition. Against his better judgement, he informed the party that the 1-5 Potentium had been acquired for the purposes of attacking the Ikas Feather. \n- Apparently the Ikas Feather had been a problem for some time now for the guild for a myriad of reasons:\n\t- In the past they killed anyone from the guild that they crossed paths with in [[The Grand Nothing]]. However they stopped doing that 6 years ago, instead opting for their strange questions.\n\t- They often recruit new members from [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. It is not know how they do this with such success.\n\t- It was know that they had a presence in the new world. Specifically [[Tenzentak]] and [[The Bladehammer Guild]] by extension. However, they have recently been spotted as far as [[Laenwalde]] conducting assassinations all across the three corners.\n\t\t- Because of this they are seen as a modern threat.\n- Our heroes weren't sure as to why, but during the entire encounter Old Abby seemed to be withholding information. You weren't what precisely.\n- In response, our heroes asked for some time with the recovered warforged without Abby present. He hesitantly obliged, but definitely wasn't pleased. The party wasn't able to parse anything new from the body but were able to discover it more from the drawing.\n\t- When held to the light, at the correct angle, the lights from the drawing shine the word \"HELP\" on the wall. Written in common.\n- Departing Abby's office, our heroes decided to look into The Three Fools' apartment as they'd be sequestered for the day. Buying kites, fireworks, and a good luck charm on the way there.\n- Our heroes broke into the apartment while Sherman kept watch. Unfortunately his presence was spotted and guards were sent for.\n- Before the city watch arrived, our heroes were able to search the place. \n\t- They discovered Tadich's room to be surprisingly mundane. The greatest thing of note being an old sketch of his late wife.\n\t- Eddoch's room was another story. Behind a broken away piece of plaster was a small box containing hefty bag of platinum, a receipt for legal fees tendered on behalf of The Street Dogs (It was Eddoch who had hired at least one of the lawyers who came to defend you on the day prior), and a red feather. The receipt was to a Burgand Law Office located at Inner Smog Town Gate. Your dwarven acquaintance was more than meets the eye. Next to the box was an inactive span read.\n- The guards arrived, arresting Sherman and kicking in the apartment door. \n- A poorly executed escape was made in which Rozwald prompted Magnus to set off \"Big Bertha\", a massive bundle of fireworks, directly into the faces of the incoming guards. The celebratory explosives filled The Three Fools apartment with light, color, and scorch marks. Luckily you didn't start a fire, but were identified by the guards.\n- The party wasn't sure what to make of the situation. It seemed that poor Laizen was unaware of his friends secret lives. Eddoch likely a member of The Ikas feather, and Tardich of some unknown alliance. It was speculated that the cowboy may be one of the many people hired nefariously by Grand Master Colin Coinge.\n- As a sort of alibi, the party made a beeline for the second ring. Hoping to claim that they'd been at the event all morning.\n- Our heroes then spent the day watching as fighters of great skill battled. The Three Fools fought all the way to the finals. The penultimate match was neck and neck, only won by Laizen who accomplished a remarkable feat of skill. It was as if a door opened within him, Laizen managing to pull off a [[Vizir]] Burn.\n- **Chapter ends just before sunset on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-21-What-Do-You-Know":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 21 - What Do You Know","content":"- **Chapter begins just before sunset on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes decided that the next course of action was to look into the acquisition of the 1-5 Potentium itself, and explore the Burgand Law lead.\n- Cyrus and Mal snuck into the archives using Mal's knowledge, and Cyrus' capacity for disguise. Adopting invisibility and the appearance of Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge respectively.\n- In the Archive's tiny reception area they found Jaxon Door standing guard. One of Colin Coinge's Mercenaries. There typically aren't guards of his nature in this region of the guild.\n- Inside, the two bullied their way into the restricted section where Mal managed to suss out the records they were looking for. Many guild minds had voted in favor of acquiring 1-5 Potentium to wipe out The Ikas Feather including Persephone Drone, Master Willem Bellard, Master Colin Coinge, and a Master Yaddiao. Cyrus' sticky fingers also stole a random scroll off the shelf.\n- The two of them squandered Master Coinge's reputation a bit more before leaving, but were stopped by Jaxon Door.\n- Believing Cyrus was Coinge, our heroes managed to learn a few things. Apparently the real Colin Coinge had left the city, and somehow orchestrated the demise of Master Willem Bellard within the dungeon.\n- Across the city, the rest of our heroes were pounding on the door of Bellard Law. A young, grey-blue haired half elven scribe named Heron addressed them at the door, and fetched Burgand for them. He proved to be a tired no-nonsense attorney that defended rag-tag groups of heroes from time to time. It seemed he was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" lawyer associated with The Ikas Feather.\n- Concerned for Bellard's fate, and the evidence that may be associated with it, Mal sprinted across town to find the rest of the gang while Cyrus made for the dungeon where he proceeded to harass a guard as Coinge for many minutes.\n- Thanks to Cyrus' distraction, Mal was able to slip slug past the guards and investigate. What they found was a room with a substantial amount of dried blood, and a utilitarian warforged's corpse missing one of its hands. Unbeknownst to Mal in the moment, it was the corpse of Coop. The odd warforged that was met in the dungeon. Coop was covered in blood that forensically hinted that he'd recently conducted a murder.\n- As the group lingered in the quiet hall of the guild, assassins attacked. They sought Rozwald once more.\n- A frantic battle ensued in which poison was employed, guards were alerted, and a thug was thrown into The Grand Nothing.\n- Rozwald was badly wounded but Sherman managed to scoop him up and flee with him.\n- One assassin was knocked out, and another was cornered by Deimos and Mal where he was asked what he knew...\n- **Chapter ends late on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-22-Frog-eat-Frog":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 22 - Frog eat Frog","content":"- **Chapter begins late on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had discovered something sinister within the bowels of The Guild Dungeons; Master Willem Bellard's murder.\n- Before they could act on the information, assassins attacked. They focused Rozwald in a secret attempt to provoke Sherman to pick him up and flee. All so the real assassin, a warforged named Blood bearing an odd resemblance to Sherman save for his snake-like head, could pursue. It was speculated that this warforged may be somehow related to Sherman's creator. A Monsieur Logician.\n- These assassins were not only sent to kill, but to torture information out of Rozwald. It seemed that whatever was truly going on behind the fog of warforged rebellion, Bladehammer discord, and 1-5 Potentium wasn't an even brush stroke. Lord Rozwald may be involved, but if he is he doesn't have all the information. \n- Our heroes managed to escape Blood's pursuit and reconvene at The Lumberjack where they combed over their evidence.\n\t- Master Colin Coinge had devised some unique method of incorporating ferrofluid into the bodies of warforged. This was central to his \"failsafe precaution\".\n\t- The individual who had threatened Lord Rozwald, signing his name with a \"G\" was speculated to be Gideon Gain.\n- Later in the evening, a few other things occurred at The Lumberjack\n\t- Magnus flew Viz on his kite, but discovered that distance from his dragon made him lethargic. Sickly.\n\t- Jaxon Door and Soren Slider were spotted searching for near The Lumberjack. Likely *also* hoping to assassinate you. Though this time it may have been on Colin Coinge's Behalf. Fortunately some odd magical property of The Lumberjack kept them confused, and unable to find you.\n- The next morning our heroes decided to break into Bellard's office. Magically employing a clumsy rat to help open the window. Inside, they found evidence of Bellard also seeking to solve the missing 1-5 Potentium case. His investigation reached the same place our heroes' did: a cannery.\n\t- Specific pieces of evidence found were pieces of burned paper containing the words: Coinge, Cannery, Rozwald, Rejection, and Yaddio\n\t- A victory day communication containing a [[Teleportation Circle]] diagram on it was also discovered.\n- Deciding to look into the name Yaddio more, our heroes ventured towards the guild where they had an awkward, but not hostile encounter with The Three Fools.\n- Eventually our group made their way to Abby's office. Still skeptical towards his intentions, but trusting of the old professor's earnest nature.\n- They told Abby everything about what had happened to them, save for their breaking and entering of the Three Fools Apartment.\n\t- Old Abby expressed deep concern about the assassination attempts, and took your evidence to act upon. Unfortunately, the group only had concrete evidence on Lord Rozwald, and not Colin Coinge. Hopefully the guild will intercede here. \n\t- He apologized for, and rescinded his past urgings for the group to not get involved in any more drama. He trusted you to delve into it and stop whatever was to come.\n- Before the group's departure, Old Abby was asked what he knew of the name Yaddio. He responded only with a clarifying question of his own: *Logician Yaddio?*\n- **Chapter ends Midday on the 20th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-23-Machines-that-Bleed":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 23 - Machines that Bleed","content":"- **Chapter begins Midday on the 20th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Old Abby told our heroes about Guild Mind Yaddio Logician. An artificer of great skill who mysteriously vanished many months ago, and potentially Sherman's creator.\n- Yaddio was an extremely bright artificer focused in the field of [[Warforged]] production. His studies were aimed parallel with Colin Coinge's. The two of them both sought a method of sure control over [[Warforged]].\n\t- Apparently he was charged with the care of The Bladehammer Guild's many warforged. These automatons have all been locked away in Belzan tower during your stay in the city due to the attack.\n- Our heroes split into two groups, leaving Old Abby to carry out a bureaucratic attack on Lord Rozwald and Colin Coinge.\n- Mal, Rozwald, and Cyrus set their minds to perusing the Train Station Records\n\t- They found the station in a complete mess. An overflow of commuters and overworked staff.\n\t- Amongst the commuters was the Masked Mystic who was on his way out of the city due to \"coming events\". He revealed a few things for information about The Door within The Lumberjack.\n\t\t- Colin Coinge was up to something dark. Apparently he had been the one to hire the fortune teller to \"protect\" Curtis Renaull. The fortuneteller in turned pawned the task off on you lot. It seemed the mystic wasn't very confident in Coinge, but he paid well.\n\t\t- Supposedly, Coinge was using a secret sect of mages at [[Kerketh Academy]] to forward his plan. A group of \"watchful eyes\" centuries old.\n\t\t- Lasty, the man revealed himself as Destrae. This information was given freely as if in friendship.\n\t- The Train station was understaffed, and the three academics managed to get jobs there without much fuss. They talked their way past the manager, Benjamin, and bribed an old backroom scribe, Simon to get unsupervised access to the mess of ledgers.\n\t- After hours and hours of grueling work, our book smart trio had narrowed things down to a best-bet. Unfortunately, it was at the steep cost of time. A resource in short supply.\n- The rest of the party: Deimos, Sherman and Magnus, decided to shake down any trailing leads.\n\t- Eddoch of The Three Fools was given a stern eye by Magnus\n\t- Bennet was his oblivious and rude self, as usual\n\t- and Blood, the warforged who hunted Rozwald, taunted Sherman from an alleyway. Claiming a long life spent watching Sherman until he was sold by Monsieur Logician from the back of their shared shop.\n\t- Finally, Persephone drone gave you her side of things. Nothing new was gleaned, but she reinforced your suspicions about Coinge.\n\t- They spent the remainder of the day looking into Yaddio, and found nothing\n- After sunset, our heroes reconvened and caught each other up to speed. The final bet was Devoost Cannery. A small, unproductive cannery located in Smogtown.\n- Wasting no time our heroes sought it out, and found it to be filled with rotting food, and suspicious warforged loading vials of mysterious liquid into crates.\n- This was it. In no time The Street Dogs set to what they do best. Percussive investigation.\n- **Chapter ends late on the 20th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-24-The-Tower":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 24 - The Tower","content":"\n- **Chapter begins late on the 20th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had broken into the Devoost Cannery of inner Smog Town to find a gaggle of X-Model warforged synthesizing the same acid found in the bodies of the [[Warforged]] Rebels.\n- The brawl was quick and brutal. Surprisingly, damage to the X-Model warforged revealed not acid, but an odd, black, magnetic liquid: Ferrofluid.\n- Some of the warforged ditched their efforts to fight back, opting instead to try and destroy evidence strewn around the cannery.\n- Upon defeating the warforged, a mass of crucial evidence was discovered.\n\t- The plans detailing the initial train robbery which had been completely staged. There hadn't been a scrap of 1-5 Potentium on the train.\n\t- Ledgers, written in cypher, detailed acquisitions of 1-5 potentium going five years into the past. The total acquired metal doubled what The Guild had feared.\n\t- There were damning shipments of acid had been packed for the city of [[Rails]].\n\t- A vault containing funds and spell scrolls for a quick escape.\n\t- Schematics for a 1-5 Potentium Bomb\n\t- One eerie wall was covered in evidence detailing more than a decade's worth of seemingly unrelated [[Warforged]] Rebellions that resulted in various societal collapses all over The Three Corners. A conspiracy of enormous proportion if true.\n\t- This neatly paired with a folio detailing restricted [[Kerketh Academy]] research on \"The Interconnectedness Principal\". The paper proved the existence of [[Diaphanous Magic]] passing back and forth between all [[Apparatum]] and [[Warforged]]. Warforged especially so. The diaphony supposedly causes unique interference preventing complex, multi-device interaction and hints there may be some unknown, potentially dangerous interaction between apparatum.\n\t\t- This, mixed with the eerie wall of evidence hinted at a grim conspiracy. What if the warforged terrorism is more coordinated that it seems? Or what if something is controlling the warforged, causing them to act erratically on its behalf?\n\t\t- The second half of the folio became more concerning. The individual behind all of this chaos in [[Tenzentak]] over the last week, had delved into the phenomena on their own and discovered something. A way to account for diaphanous interference, allowing for complex, multi-device communication. A massive revolution in the field of Artificery.\n\t\t- The nature of this discovery was too fundamental to trademark, purely academic in its merit rather than economic. Instead of sharing this discovery, it was kept hidden for personal gain. Its inventor used this method to create pseudo warforged. Three [[Low Automata]], technically similar to Rozwald's turrets, that work in tandem pretending to be a Warforged. Pretending to possess a soul without actually experiencing [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]].\n\t\t- Psudeoforged, by both design and restriction, are quite simplistic. Only able to carry out three complex actions before catastrophic failure. Many tests had been tried with these Psudeoforged that found them capable of complex action, but unable to form abstract thought. They could even go as far as [[Rails]], to harass a Lars Journin, and return to [[Tenzentak]].\n\t\t- Their true designs had to be kept secret. This is why their creator needed the acid to melt away internals, masking their true nature.\n\t- A collection of clarifying letters were discovered, pulling the pieces into a cohesive picture. Rejection letters, all addressed to Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge. The artificer extraordinaire had petitioned dozens of manufacturers to trademark and commodify his invention. A failsafe precaution called The Fuse. This invention, the one Gideon Gain had warned Cyrus about, could change the way warforged exist forever. But every last manufacturer had all rejected him on bad business practice. Even Lord Rozwald, Coinge's supposed colleague, had said: \"People are scared of Warforged, but not this scared.\"\n\t- Equally strange, this failsafe precaution wasn't the same discovery as his sincerely brilliant, and world changing Psudeoforged design. This new design was of a completely different, morally reprehensible nature. \n\t\t- Colin Coinge had developed a photographic ferrication process that would allow him to tie a Warforged's lifespan to a vessel of Ferrofluid that would slowly evaporate over a year. Any rouge warforged built with a fuse would turn to mundane iron in four seasons time at most. This trademarked process would mean every year, a warforged would need maintenance from a non-warforged or it would die. And Coilin Coinge would legally reap a percentage of profit from every single transaction made to build and sustain these \"safe\" warforged.\n- Colin Coinge had invented not one, but two major developments in the field of artificery. Yet no one wanted anything to do with him. People saw his work as too dangerous to their economy. Not worth the risk. So Colin Coinge set to changing their minds. It took him years to plan it, and required him to throw his lot in with a mysterious, and likely dangerous group of mages at [[Kerketh Academy]] to gain their resources. Colin Coinge would make the world fear warforged as they should, even if it meant lying to them.\n- Though his planning was not as thorough as it needed to be. His peers, Logician Yaddio, and a foul mouthed recluse on the other end of a broken span read had both made their concerns about Coinge's plan clear. Claiming he was destined to fuck it up.\n- And fuck it up he did. For our heroes had found the details for the final attack. A demolition of Belzan Tower during Lord Curtis Renaull's Anti-Warforged Speech.\n- Unfortunately, X12, Coinge's right hand Warforged had found you just as this was discovered. The automaton carried a small 1-5 Potentium bomb to wipe all remaining evidence, and our heroes off [[The Three Corners]].\n- In a moment of pure, selfless heroism, Sherman rushed X12. Tackling the smaller warforged into The Cannery's inner canal.\n- Light, fire, and destruction tore through the small industrial building. And everything went dark.\n- In the blackness, Rozwald found himself drifting through smoke. Amongst the emptiness, was the dying body of Egan Alzby, lying on the watery edge of a beach. He warned Rozwald. Telling him to run, to flee from *him*. Rozwald pleaded for clarification, but Egan couldn't find the words. Before Rozwald could open his mouth again, a singular word, a command, forced its way into everyone's mind: **WAKE**\n- The word, like a spike through reality itself threw all of our heroes upright in bed. They had been taken to The Guild surgery, pumped full of healing alchemy on Old Abby's dime, and watched over by Eddoch.\n- Sherman was no where to be seen.\n- Our heroes suddenly learned that the entire city was in disarray. Victory Day celebrations cancelled, riots in the streets, and Lord Curtis Renaull was about ten minutes from giving his speech.\n- Our heroes left in a rush, not able to mourn their lost friend. Eddoch gave any help he could, and outed himself as a member of the Ikas Feather to you.\n- Through the streets our champions ran towards the imposing silhouette of Belzan Tower. Perched on the edge of The Grand Nothing, adorned with flapping kites, and lined with filled balconies that looked down on the chaos below.\n- Lord Curtis Renaull was giving his speech to a riotous, doomed crowd. In a stroke of genius, Magnus knew the people needed a reason to panic. But the distance was much to far for any normal man to interfere.\n- Fortunately, Deimos is no normal man. The mutant climbed to the nearest roof, nocked an arrow, and scored a direct hit into the meat of Curtis Renaull's arm at over 500ft away.\n- The crowd exploded into panic, as The Street Dogs snuck into the back entrance of Belzan Tower to find rows and rows of empty Warforged containment units leading all the way to Colin Coinge himself. It all led to a standstill with Colin Coinge's thumb hovering over a detonator.\n- Far off in the city, the body of Sherman lay still. Forced between two rocks at the bottom of the canal, mere feet from [[The Grand Nothing]]'s Cliff.\n- As the water rushed past the unmoving hero, someone appeared to him. An old mentor, Beophan. Sherman had not only avoided vaporization, but had survived the blast. However the event had left him paralyzed from the neck down.\n- But everyone was still in danger.\n- Pushing, fighting, *raging* against the cruelty of the world, Sherman's horns thrust out, forcing his chin down sharply downwards and reconnecting his spine.\n- Bursting from the canal, half singed, and fully determined Sherman sprinted to Belzan tower through streets lined with fear, protestors, and waiting Psudeoforged.\n- Colin Coinge scorned you. His mission, too great, and important to fail. His confidence wavered when Mal blasted the detonator from his hand in a remarkable feat of skill. Before Coinge could scoop it up Sherman smashed through the window, all burnt metal and broken glass and stomped the device to pieces.\n- But it hadn't been a detonator at all. It was one of the spell scrolls from the vault. Colin Coinge's way out. The reality of the situation was plain on the artificer's face. Pure fear and spite. A warforged had doomed Colin Coinge.\n- In a rage, Coinge threw every warforged containment lever, and screamed a single command. **Kill.**\n- Over forty guild warforged rushed our heroes, who barely made it down corridor and hid behind a set of Apparatum Blast doors.\n- There, in the center of the room, strapped to a column was a 1-5 potentium bomb.\n- The heartbeats of our heroes, the sound of metal hands scraping against blast doors, and the deep wicked pounding inside Deimos' head counted the seconds as time ran thinner and thinner.\n- Rozwald had spent the last years of his life at the mercy of the world, unable to take hold of his things. But this... *this* he could do.\n- As if it were as simple as lighting a pipe, Rozwald jammed the clockwork mechanism with only a second to spare. But the doom within Deimos' head still built to a crescendo. \n- In that piece of a moment, Deimos and Rozwald both realized it. This wasn't the only bomb.\n- The explosion ripped through the building. Blast doors, inches thick caved in like they were made of thin aluminum. A shockwave of blinding light stole everyone senses, and threw the party airborne.\n- They were falling.\n- Falling.\n- *Still falling.*\n- Colin Coinge had designed the tower to topple onto Cliffside Square, but through disarming a single explosive you botched the entire plan. Sending the tower, and everyone in it falling into The Grand Nothing.\n- Our heroes fell. Plummeting into the void, thousands and thousands of feet deep.\n- But this couldn't be it, could it?\n- Hope is a generous term, but you can't help but think there must be some way out of this mess. This couldn't have all been for nothing.\n- Around you, victims, debris, and enormous pieces of tower tear through a sky filled with fire, and spiraling kites.\n- And amongst it all, are warforged hell bent on killing you.\n- **Chapter end on the 21st of Spring, Victory Day, Eighteenth Bell, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-25-God":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 25 - God","content":"- **Chapter begins on the 21st of Spring, Victory Day, Eighteenth Bell, Annum 4466**\n- A detonation of 1-5 Potentium threw our heroes into The Grand Nothing, dooming them to fall thousands and thousands of feet to their death.\n- Fear and grit outweighed danger as The Street Dogs fell through a sky of rubble, fire, smoke, victims, and deadly warforged set to kill.\n- But our heroes would not let their journey end here.\n- Vizir surged brightly within our The Street Dogs, sparking within them.\n\t- Cyrus' nesting doll, a secret and prized possession reached beyond the man in the mask. Unlocking a deep and mysterious power. This allowed him to rally falling victims within the safety of his magic. Well, safe so long as *he* found a way out of this mess too.\n\t- The hidden power within Deimos broke through, consuming the fearful sky, drinking the world in until its dark lust was saited. It had finally grown strong enough to escape... but it didn't. Instead, the terror-drunk entity locked itself deep within Deimos' skull, granting him perfect, yet horrible senses of the world around him.\n\t- Something had triggered within Mal. A touch of the ancient, and infallible. A taste of the ultimate past itself. The arcanist's eyes filled with vibrant color, and his unique chronomantic skills were amplified ten-fold.\n\t- Sherman, the sole hero not targeted by Colin Coinge's Psudeoforged, was unrestricted by his fear of falling on this day. Soaring from ally to ally, still half scorched from the 1-5 Potentium Blast he had somehow survived, Sherman would live opposite to Coinge's narrative or die trying.\n\t- Magnus, unable to find [[Adrathar]]'s aid when he needed it most, didn't let fear get the better of him. Nor did his faithful ally, Viz. In their moment of peril, the two of them dug deeper into their bond then ever before. Finding new power and resolve.\n\t- And of course, reality required yet more for poor old Rozwald, who already had saved his home city from historical destruction today. Falling debris had left [[Gilligan's Lift]] was in peril. Fortunately, the disarmed bomb, still stable within its container, fell alongside Rozwald.\n- The following minutes were filled with violence, disorientation, and sheer determination as our heroes scanned the sky for a glimmer of salvation.\n- Unfortunately, they found only more problems.\n\t- Important guild members like artificers, and surgeons were amongst the airborne.\n\t- Other... guild members fell as well like the ever-cranky Bennet Frence.\n\t- Even Adja Corsair, guild mind and daughter of Guild Master Helg Corsair was in the fray.\n- Fortunately, Cyrus was able to save more than his fair share. Catching each of the aforementioned victims within his nesting doll. Adja Corsair being the most notable. \n\t- Lady Kalimae Sky had seemingly *leapt* from the city above to call in her favor. She demanded that The Street Dogs save Adja personally, and warned him of a coming someone, and their terrible fire.\n- Colin Coinge, against his plans, had also been caught in the blast. In a similar vein to our heroes, Coinge hadn't given up yet, and targeted a section of falling tower used by Airshipwrights. \n- Our heroes wouldn't let him slip by this time. They pursued vehemently as heroes from the city above joined the fray, trying to save as many lives as they could. Some were successful, others becoming unfortunate sacrifices themselves.\n- After a struggle, Magnus and Mal managed to corner Coinge, who's plan was unravelling further and further by the second. It all came to a head when magnus tackled Coinge *through* a floor, and sending him sprawling down the whirling pit of a staircase. On the landing, the narcissist gave an arrogant smile when he spotted what he had been searching for: a semi-constructed [[Airship]] hull. This smug grin was marked as his last when Mal, who had magically snuck ahead of Coinge, appeared behind one of the hull's cannons.\n- Coinge had tried to play god, but a single, high-pressure beam of energy wiped Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge, and his shit eating grin, off The Prime forever. Coinge may have had grand designs. But in the end, he died like any man.\n- Coinge's death was a victory, but a small one given the circumstances. As the ground was still growing closer and closer by the second.\n- The section of tower that threatened Gilligan's lift was on a crash-course. Rozwald, never backing down from a challenge that risked his mortality for the greater good, pulled the 1-5 Potentium out from its containment unit, loaded it into his Hand Mortar, and fired. All eyes in the sky traced the burning white arc that sprouted from Rozwald's gun. Then, a blinding explosion, followed by a second detonation within the tower section, likely the 1-5 Potentium that had been returned to the guild, almost entirely vaporized the offending structure. Gilligan's Lift, and everyone inside it, had been saved.\n- The shockwave forced rubble in every direction. After a long, disorienting moment, Sherman spotted something amongst the chaos. A relatively circular section of tower flipping like a coin. On one side, a metal-inlay teleportation circle still half-affixed in crumbling stone.\n- Our heroes made a beeline for it. However, not all had remained conscious in the fray. Rozwald, Magnus, and Deimos had succumbed to their wounds. Worse, wounds weren't the only thing Deimos had succumbed too.\n- A fearsomely strong, inhuman force within Deimos had taken over. It fought against Sherman's aid in a self-sabotaging effort. It was more concerned with observing the spectacle of the fall rather than surviving it.\n- And to put a bow on the whole ordeal, a being of pure, holy fire crested over the cliff's edge. A creature of undeniable divinity. This was not Haith Nallian. Tenzentak, on this day of terror, stood in the presence of a god. It burned like a second sun. [[The Word of Fire]].\n- Protruding tendrils of fire judged everything in its path, incinerating unwanted rubble, and unworthy plummeters. Its presence was not benevolent.\n- Now sandwiched between terrible, sentient fire above and the unforgiving ground below, our heroes wasted no time in heading for the the turning circle. This was their last hope. \n- Those capable of making contact clung to the disintegrating rubble with bloody fingers. Mal, forced to reach beyond his means, dug deep within as he burned through the spell scroll stolen from Coinge's things.\n- Magnus, who had fallen unconscious, was pulled in by Cyrus' magic, and Sherman managed to secure Deimos' fearsome, possessed form. \n- Rozwald still fell freely.\n- With each revolution of the flipping circle, our heroes tried to reach out and grab the Grung, falling just out of reach.\n- Sherman, forced to pin a resistant Deimos to the surface of the circle, was soon the only one still in reach of Rozwald. He was left with a choice between his two friend lives. He could easily save either one of them. \n- But the caretaker wouldn't settle for just one. Risking it all, Sherman leapt at the platform's rotational apex. His friend's forced to watch his all-or-nothing attempt disappear with the circle's revolution. His first swipe caught only air, but the second caught the noble grung's haughty neckline. Sherman's foot found a substantial piece of falling debris and he kicked for all he was worth. \n- Deimos, or rather the thing inside him, chanced its escape. Unfortunately for him, Sherman's descending iron fist returned to lay him flat against the circle again.\n- Mal who'd been forced to play mental gymnastics, weighing each of his friend's chances of survival, activated the circle just as the descending tendrils of fire began to singe flesh.\n- Reality fluttered and fanned violently like the pages of a riffled text. The spell, while sure and complex in its design seemed unprepared to handle the sheer momentum of the party. Transforming the excess energy into vibrant heat, unnatural sound, and colored light.\n- Everything came to a terrible, but certainly survivable, crashing heap as the last remnants of our heroes momentum shattered and felled the high wooden scaffold which held the guild's temporary, Victory Day teleportation circle.\n- **Chapter ends the 21st of Spring, Victory Day, one terrifying fall's worth of minutes after Eighteenth Bell, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-26-Holy-Fire":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 26 - Holy Fire","content":"- **Chapter begins the 21st of Spring, Victory Day, one terrifying fall's worth of minutes after Eighteenth Bell, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes lay in a groaning heap amongst the temporary Victory Day Teleportation Circle's remains. Each fighting through various stages of unconsciousness.\n\t- Deimos, who's last conscious memory was falling to his death, drifted through a dream. A common, reoccurring dream. An echo of a memory in which he fled from a troll whilst trying to escape becoming a Dreadslayer Mutant. But something was wrong. Intangibly so. Deimos discovered a child version of himself next to a nearly unrecognizable, shredded corpse of the pursing troll. He could feel something watching him. Two, distinct entities. And in the chest cavity of the troll was a stone arched wooden door. A terrible presence banged on the other side. As he reached to open it with a trembling hand, he woke.\n\t- Magnus swam through the winds. The fall became flying which soon fell to walking along the shores of [[The Storm Horizon]]. Sitting on a stone outcropping, pondering the nature of divinity, was his father. Torin. A warm, tearful reunion was had. Though Torin's thoughts seemed elsewhere. Torin asked of purpose. The purpose of Adrathar's storms, and the purpose of Magnus' journey.\n- Magnus woke to the whining of Bennet Frence in some foreign interior. The inside of Cyrus' nesting doll. The odd scene didn't last long enough for Magnus to investigate and he soon found himself amongst the heap of his exhausted friends.\n- Guild members emerged from blowing clouds of smoke. Worn and apprehensive from the events of the last 12 hours. Guild Master Helg Corsair was even there. He questioned The Street Dogs thoroughly, but only until he spotted Adja Corsair amongst the people our heroes had saved.\n- Too weighed down by exhaustion, injury, and stretched thin by the chaos, the whole group decided to put a pin in the conversation for a later time.\n- Our heroes found rest, where Cyrus' physicality betrayed a slightly abnormal nature. Despite missing a chunk of his torso, Cyrus wasn't dead and didn't bleed.\n- Old Abby found our heroes after a short while and got caught up with the recent events. The group then headed towards The Guild courtyard where guild members were trying to rally for an organized response.\n- Before anyone from The Guild could address the gathered, a presence stole the entirety of Tenzentak's attention. [[The Word of Fire]].\n- Valmore rose into the sky, casting light on the strained city. Heroic and terrible. The unmistakable sensation of a pit opening within each and every onlooker's mind. For all the event's of the day, this one carried a unique weight.\n- The burning god made his dissatisfaction with the city known. Valmore condemned the city's distance from the trinity, and raised a burning symbol of three flaming, interlocked rings into the sky. The fixture of the trinity made from Belzan Tower's rubble.\n- Valmore left the symbol in the sky as a reminder to the people of Tenzentak, and left as Ashian priests, known as conflagrators, emerged from the crowd and began preaching their foreign religion to the masses.\n- The city was thrown into further chaos by the event. However, The Street Dogs had done their part and needed rest. They made for The Lumberjack. A task made easier when they ran into Leonard Bebother, the farmer who had originally showed them how to get to Fox's Hollow, let them hop into his cart. Sleep found our heroes immediately back at their abandoned tavern.\n- The next morning was spent recuperating, relaxing, and reflecting on the previous days events. The Street Dogs made for the nearby lake to wash all the ash and blood from their bodies. At the lake, two major things occurred.\n\t- Sherman somehow used magic in a way he'd been previously unable to. As if his body had adapted to his circumstances.\n\t- Deimos, for once, found a moment of peace in the waters. It was a passing thing, but the first time in a while he did not feel the fear of the world.\n- Now clean, The Street Dogs decided they'd spend the next while restoring their new tavern. The set off to Fox's Hollow to buy some supplies.\n\t- On the way there two farmers watched them from a distant hill. These would later be identified as Ansen and Goose.\n\t- The general store was run by a small minded, but not unkind dwarven man named Beeda. Beeda informed our heroes of troubles with broken bridges, gnolls, and trolls in the woods near town.\n\t- John Smith, the local dwarven blacksmith whose name was not his true one, was more open minded than Beeda's. John sold them tools and reassured them about the town.\n- Back at the Lumberjack, a knock on the door signaled the arrival of the town's lawmen. Warden Marg and Deputy Keeper. Warden Marg seemed a stern but fair woman who didn't want anything to do with squatters. Though upon seeing their deed, sent her anxious deputy for a man named Heron.\n- Heron, funnily enough, already had met the party. He was the scribe from Burgand Law. Heron gave what assurances he could about the document's legitimacy to the warden. Warden Marg told our heroes they could stay.\n- So long as the promised nothing bad would come of this...\n- **Chapter ends the 22nd of Spring, Midday, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-27-Bar-Rescue":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 27 - Bar Rescue","content":"- **Chapter begins the 22nd of Spring, Midday, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had the tools necessary for restoring their tavern. Now they just had to actually do it.\n- The first order of business was attach Sherman's new arm. A task completed by Mal and Rozwald who discovered an alarming phenomenon amongst the runes that power Sherman's mechanisms. A mortality rune, an artifact of [[Necromancy]], burned into Sherman's chest cavity. Sherman had died, touched [[The Mortal Coil]], and returned from [[The Ethos]].\n- After that concerning discovery, the gang decided to talk future plans for their new Tavern. The general consensus was to inhabit the upper floors, and allow the 2nd and 1st to function as the main body of the Tavern. There would also need to be careful precautions taken for the Basement as that was where The Door was located.\n\t- Sherman and Rozwald would take the 4th floor tower with plans to add a dividing wall.\n\t- Mal and Deimos taking the 3rd floor tower rooms, with plans to connect the two distinct sections (The Tower and Main House) via a hallway.\n\t- Magnus taking the 3rd floor master bedroom, one of the few rooms suitable for a person of his size.\n\t- and Cyrus would take the basement lodging to keep a closer eye on The Door. Likely with the intention to knock down some of the walls, and form a larger room.\n- While these plans gave direction, they were a long way off. Our heroes needed materials and set of towards the city to get some.\n- The city was sadly not in a place to provision. With the fallout from the Victory Day attack, most efforts were focused on aiding the wounded, and clearing rubble from the bomb blast, and smaller Psudeoforged clashes all across the inner city.\n- Mal had the bright idea to capitalize on some of the salvage. By clearing rubble, it was likely that no one would care where they took it. Cyrus, Deimos, and Rozwald set to finding some suitable materials while Mal, Magnus, and Sherman ventured to see Old Abby.\n- The professor was busy to say the least, and was discovered raising his voice at a few [[Kerketh Academy]] Academics. He apologized for the outburst and greeted our heroes. Abby recognized the actions of The Street Dogs, and how they saved hundreds of lives despite the disaster.\n- He spoke of the city and the state of the guild. All things considered the chaos was slowly being formed back into order, but the people are quite frazzled. He informed our heroes of an official guild address the next morning, and urged them to attend.\n- Before leaving, Sherman asked Old Abby about Yaddiao. Old Abby gave what little he could, acknowledging the challenges Sherman faces, and offering any help he could.\n- The rest of the day was spent hauling lumber debris into a salvaged cart. The cart had been restored by Rozwald who had employed a beggar to find a \"lost wheel\" for him.\n- On the way out of the city, Aleksander Salt's bounty was checked and found to still be active, and Mal purchased some academic's supplies.\n- The party rested while Deimos' was tormented by his recurring nightmare. In the morning, they found Sherman who seemed extremely pleased with himself. The automaton had found an \"abandoned ladder\". The other's didn't have the heart to explain that he'd stolen it from an apple orchard.\n- Back in Tenzentak Proper, The Street Dogs attended the Guild Address where many things came to light\n\t- [[The Bladehammer Guild]] fessed up to their failures. Publicly admitting that they had been the one's to order the 1-5 Potentium to the city. A purchase made in preparation to deal with the Threat of The Ikas Feather. Their actions had left 243 Dead, 1003 injured .\n\t- Tardich had somehow found a stray X-Model [[Warforged]]. The warforged had been \"magically interrogated\" revealing Colin Coinge's plot to the guild. Helg publicly announced the fact that the attackers were not free Warforged, but falsities made to spread fear. Hopefully the public will listen.\n\t- Guild associations with Kerketh were indefinitely suspended. A major development as this means the two largest, non governmental entitles in [[The Free Cities]] are now at odds.\n\t- Guild Mind Master Colin Coinge was denounced and his death was made known. However, Helg did not say who had killed him.\n\t- Many guild members were thanked for their bravery, including the party who were credited with saving Cliffside square and Guild Mind Adja Corsair. However, none would be \n\t- The sudden presence of [[Ashian]] doctrine in the city's streets was also mentioned in a negative light.\n\t- Finally all Guild affairs are now focused within The Free Cities until order is restored.\n- The guild was in an outrage, but before our heroes could be swept into the chaos. A scribe pulled The Street Dogs aside and brought them to Helg's office to speak in private.\n\t- There, he sincerely thanked our heroes without any hint of politics.\n\t- The Street Dogs events over the last week were accounted for in great, formal detail. Helg was thorough in his questioning and seemed keen on them details of Colin Coinge's span read communications and the name \"Lars Journin\". He also informed the party that Lord Rozwald was being protected by [[Laenwalde]] and  [[The University]].\n\t- Guild Master Helg also offered any favor he could.\n\t\t- Providing what little detail he had on Yaddiao, who is likely in [[Eucaren]] or [[Audran]]. \n\t\t- A writ of endorsement for Mal to maybe help him access exclusive archives across [[The Three Corners]].\n\t\t- A set of high-quality magical communication devices known as Bethar's Bells.\n\t\t- And finally, giving what little manpower he has in [[The Ward]] instruction to offer aid to [[The North Honor]]. A meager thing, but it is the best [[The Bladehammer Guild]] could offer Magnus in the current situation.\n\t- The last point of order was an arrowhead dug out of Lord Curtis Renaull's Shoulder. An arrowhead distinctly made in the fashion of [[Dreadslayers]]. Not only had they shot a noble, but Lord Renaull had contracted Bandits Blight. A magical form of infection caused by the cross contamination of monster viscera. He would lose his arm. Few knew The Street Dogs had shot him, but Helg wants to ensure there is a record of good will if it ever comes to light. He would have to find some suitable repercussions for The Street Dogs in the coming weeks.\n- As the meeting came to a close. On the third day of its time in the sky, the burning symbol of [[The Trinity]] left by [[The Word of Fire]] burned up.\n- **Chapter ends the 23rd of Spring, Late Morning, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-28-Salvage":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 28 - Salvage","content":"- **Chapter begins the 23rd of Spring, Late Morning, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had attended [[The Bladehammer Guild]] address and a private meeting with Guild Master Corsair. [[Tenzentak]] was dusting itself off from the Victory Day attack, but the path that lay ahead was not an easy one.\n- Moving on to brighter things, the party realized that a functioning tavern required patrons, and the people of Fox's hollow were apprehensive to say the least.\n- A plan was hatched to gain the townspeople's trust\n\t- Any chance they had to make friends, or show generosity would be pursued\n\t- They'd host a cookout on the 28th of Spring\n\t- And The Street Dogs would see to the towns longstanding troll problem\n- While Mal and Sherman sought Abby's help in procuring protective magic to use against the troll, the others returned to Fox's Hollow where they met Ansen, the Shephard. Ansen spoke a bit about the past owners of The Lumberjack, Therin and Fejn. He hadn't been alive in their time, but knew some things. Therin was a kind old painter, and his husband Fejn was a troubled soul who killed himself after Therin's ailment took him.\n- Further into the sleepy town they met Alice, the Butcher's Daughter. While a bit prickly, the young woman sold them the pig they'd use for their cookout to be picked up in four day's time.\n- Then there was Monolater Carla. Head of the local Zolaen Chapel of Giriam. The woman, who was young for her station, had been the town's most recent newcomer along with her brother. The priestess was glad for the fresh company. What the monolater lacked in seniority she made up for in wisdom. A more than necessary tool for someone in her position. The Divine Aspect of her chapel, Giriam, was dead.\n- After the afternoon's errands were completed, our heroes wasted no time in hunting down the troll. A task made much easier by The Lumberjack's resident monster hunter, Deimos.\n- The troll had claimed the sole bridge along the most efficient route to the city as its territory. Successfully residing so close to a town, meant it was old, smart and dangerous. This would not be a simple task.\n- Investigation found that it had laid traps all throughout the woods. And closer to the bridge itself, a pungent, reeking odor stung the air. Seeming to corrupt the forest itself.\n- This was a rot troll. An ordinary troll afflicted by a fatal disease that made it extremely dangerous.\n- Our heroes hunted it, relying on fire, acid, and the element of surprise. They managed to sneak up to its lair, but it had caught on to the fact something was nearby, and climbed to a defensible position.\n- As the evening light began to wain, our heroes found themselves in a tense standoff with a dangerous, rotting monstrosity.\n- **Chapter begins the 23rd of Spring, Twilight, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-29-The-Troll-Toll":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 29 - The Troll Toll","content":"- **Chapter begins the 23rd of Spring, Twilight, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had tracked the Rot Troll to its lair, but hadn't been able to catch it fully off guard\n- A violent fray ensued. The troll flung handfuls of stone down at our heroes while the party tried to fight back at range.\n- The fight was forced into close quarters where the troll was at extreme advantage.\n- Half of the party was bested by the troll, but it had grown so wounded it could only flee in terror.\n- It may have gotten away too if not for the fact its pursuers were led by a career monster hunter. One that could *literally* smell his fear.\n- Deimos felled the creature with a final arrow, and our heroes took its bones back to Fox's Hollow. \n- Back at The Lumberjack, discussions were had.\n\t- Mal spoke of Slug and the nature of his own magic with more transparency than ever before. Mal was a *chronurgist* or *chronomancer*. Specializing in magic that alters time itself. [[Chronomancy]] is often seen as the most difficult, outlandish, and dangerous school of magic. Slug's omnidimensional physiology, and how Mal seems to be capable of fast-forwarding someone's natural decay were manifestations of him \"dipping his toes\" into the laws of time.\n\t- Cyrus' peculiar magic was also questioned. He chalked up his bloodless, fabric-based torso to being some form of elven magic that allowed him to avoid injury.\n\t- The Door was also discussed. One of The Lumberjack's previous owners, Therin, had been an artist who'd painted dozens of landscapes depicting locations all across The Three Corners. However, he was said to have a debilitating disease. Could he have been using The Door to see the world? It shed some light on the mysterious object, yet little was truly known. The Door is immensely powerful, and gives a similar sensation to that of [[The Word of Fire]]. Could the door have been made by a [[Wordbearer]]?\n- The next morning, our heroes handed over proof of The Troll's death to Warden Marg, then immediately set to uncovering more about The Lumberjack.\n- They attacked the pile of rubble in the basement. The one that held mysterious pages of a journal. In total there were 18 pages discovered. All of which were written in an unknown language, save for two. The one they'd previously found, and the one they discovered today...\n- **Chapter ends the 24th of Spring, Late Morning, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.767233368Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-3-Wake-Boost":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 3 - Wake Boost","content":" - **Chapter begins on the early evening on the 12th of Spring, 4466**\n - Slaying Skimmer-Back Ger'zar Bandits in the Baradan Canyon\n\t - One kept screaming \"Autonom\" in reverence at Sherman\n - Made camp in a set of twisted ruins, warped by the effect of [[The Undoing]]\n\t - They discovered a long forgotten body crucified in the [[Arkian]] fashion. Likely a traitor to someone out in the lawless Grand Nothing.\n\t - Seemed to be a place frequented by travellers, covered in graffiti and the droppings of old camp sites\n - The group rested well, but during the night secrets shifted amongst our heroes' shadows\n\t - Sherman contacted... someone via span-read. An individual asking if he had infiltrated \"The Guild\" yet.\n\t\t - The unknown contact seemed keen on Sherman finding whoever made \"The Discovery\"\n\t\t - Was told to show them his \"Mask of Iron\"\n\t - Rozwald dreamt of the ruins in which he slept. However, they were vacant, and enshrouded in smoke.\n\t\t - In the din, he spotted a shape standing in the door which had once held the crucified body. Egan. His father's late Colleague.\n\t\t\t - A supposed genius who died of the same type of affliction Rozwald suffers from. [[Materiation]] into smoke.\n\t\t - He was seen smoking from the same pipe which Rozwald regularly uses\n\t\t - They spoke of Rozwald's father, a distant, challenging, and driven man.\n\t\t - They also spoke of the burden of potential, and how Egan was keen on seeing Rozwald use his.\n - Our heroes set off in the morning, reaching The Drifting Isles at the later half of the next day.\n- With some difficulty, the group managed to use the Drift Spiker, an [[Apparatum]] (lent by the Blade Hammer Guild) capable of producing a Zipline instantaneously to get atop the isle approximately indicated by Professor Abby. \n\t- Sherman's fear of heights was no aid in the matter.\n- Initial scouring of the otherworldly floating island quickly revealed the presence of a full grown Rok, one of the colossal red predatory birds that was spotted while descending [[Gilligan's Lift]]. \n\t- Luckily the group managed to stay hidden, and identify the approximate location of its nest on an adjacent drifting isle due to Deimos' keen senses.\n- Our Heroes had to hunt for their mark stealthily, the Rok noticed their presence via scent, but not their location.\n- A strange, person sized impact crater was found on the rain forest like island. Along with small pieces of a [[Warforged]], and massive Rok-sized Talon prints in the mud.\n- The group deduced that the territorial bird had likely picked up the shiny treasure, and brought it back to its nest.\n\t- There was also brief mention of how you all shared a premonition of this mission.\n- A clever distraction was built using Rozwald's cunning. His \"rat-smacker\" was turned into a remarkably effective noise maker by sacrificing Sherman's cook pot.\n- The noisemaker was flung off the island, into the depths below, causing the Rok to chase after it\n- In a rush of sheer excitement, panic, and fear, our heroes crossed over to the next island via Drift Spiker and stormed the nest\n- It was a colossal structure, made of full sized logs and thick mud. The great nest was lined with bits and bobs of shiny metal\n\t- Corpses adorned in steel armor \n\t- Old skimmers, some in reasonable condition, but most were total wrecks\n\t- And of course, the Warforged. Precisely the same as the one in your shared dream, something clutched tightly in is remaining fist.\n- But before you could reach it, an oversized, disturbing, pink skinned, barely feathered, baby Rok emerged from behind a pile of wrecked skimmers. Its bulging eyes blinking with a dangerous curiosity at the party.\n- **Chapter ends on the early evening on the 13th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-30-Curious-Passerbys":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 30 - Curious Passerbys","content":"- **Chapter begins the 24th of Spring, Late Morning, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had uncovered 16 pages of the mysterious journal. The final being written in common. Identifying the mysterious language from the other pages as Feocaul, and indicating its author. A troubled soul named Fejn who may have been a Wordbearer of some sort, perhaps the creator of The Door, and possibly Valmore's brother.\n- The group split in two for the day. Mal and Deimos hung back to repair the lumberjack while the others went into town to try and find some sort of security of Rozwald. Hopefully gaining info on those who would see him killed.\n- The lumberjack repairs went smoothly, save for the young *romantic* couple who were found taking advantage of the garden shed. Holes, like that of the third floor, were filled in with what wood was available, and a few of the smaller rooms were tidied.\n- Those who went into town had a less peaceful afternoon. A string of inquisition into the Tenzentak underbelly brought our heroes to a disreputable tavern called The Pit. Our clever protagonists tried, and failed to convince Lenny, the eely spy master, to give up any info he had on Blood. After a tense bout *negotiations* Lenny charged the group a hefty sum for a possible meeting with Blood, then promptly kicked them out of The Pit.\n- Cyrus also took an opportunity to slip into the guild dungeons for a conversation with Lord Septurn. He managed to learn of The Ikas Feather, Rione Elsitor, and Curtis Renaull.\n\t- Damian Ikas who had apparently freed a large amount of Illegitimate slaves, had actually saved captives from a much more gruesome fate. Twisted, organized mass torture for some unknown purpose.\n\t- Rione Elsitor had expressed a strange interest in the same line of questions. Apparently he'd been a random boy-toy of the rude noble's, but Cyrus seemed to think he was something more.\n\t- Lord Septurn didn't hesitate to complain about Lord Renaull either. He remarked on Curtis' strange luck. As if something were protecting him, or toying with his fate.\n\t- The breadth of Lord Septurn's information came from a spy network his family paid. The imprisoned noble's only method of contact was a span read communication network, bound by exchanged passwords.\n- After dinner, our heroes set out for their meeting with Blood. There was uncertainty about his attendance, but the feral warforged did not disappoint.\n\t- The serpentine automaton taunted our heroes. Sherman most of all. He seemed obsessed with his \"Brother\".\n\t- Surprisingly, he admitted to Lord Rozwald having called off the hit. However, Blood, who was instructed to return, remained in Tenzentak to observe, toy with, and possibly hunt Sherman.\n\t- And finally, the question that had danced around the fray of the last week was answered. All this time Lord Rozwald had been in the city of [[Ryze]]. The very place in which Oog Rozwald had been forced to live in the gutters, and had traveled across The Three Corners from in search of his family.\n- Sherman, sick of Blood's games grabbed hold of the assassin and threw his entire metaphysical weight against him, causing something odd to occur. Sherman vanished from The Prime Material plane, bringing Blood with him.\n- The two of them found themselves in what seemed to in the vast belly of some great machine. Phantoms of [[Apparatum]] floating as echoes of their true form back in the [[Prime Material Plane]].\n- Exploring this world revealed an imprint of nearby destruction. The overlaid plane of existence had led Sherman and Blood back to Devoost Cannery where Sherman had presumably sent the tiny 1-5 potentium bomb into this realm. At least partially.\n- Another clash with Blood somehow shunted the assassin back into the real world where Sherman could now see Blood's essence like the [[Apparatum]] before. An essence that was too tempting not to touch...\n- **Chapter ends the 24th of Spring, Late Evening, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-31-The-Hum-of-Some-Great-Machine":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 31 - The Hum of Some Great Machine","content":"- **Chapter begins on the 24th of Spring, Late Evening, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had managed to secure a meeting with the Warforged Assassin, Blood. Employed by Lord Rozwald and built by Sherman's creator, Master Logician Yaddio.\n- The meeting began tensely, and hazardously slid in a direction no one expected when Sherman teleported Blood and himself into another dimension. A mechanical echo of [[The Prime]].\n- Inside, Sherman tapped into Blood's memories by way of this new, mysterious power. Not only giving insight to Blood's malicious nature, but the natal life of a warforged.\n- Sherman, still new to this magic, found that interacting with The Prime pulled him back towards it, shunting him into the material world once more. The shock of it all caused both parties to flee. Blood may be a killer, but what had happened truly disturbed him.\n- Back at The Lumberjack, Sherman acknowledged his painful past. Both to the group and himself. Sherman had been a servant of Heliodor, serving a young ward named Lord Holden Herschel. A ward who had pushed him from the flying city. \n- This event had sent him down a decades long journey, resulting with him accepting a dangerous mission in the far east. A revelation within urged him to abandon the mission this morally grey quest that had originally led him to Tenzentak.\n- Sherman ventured out to the lake on his own, and disposed of his connection to this mission. A span read that paired him to mysterious and dangerous warforged rebels. At least he perceived the mundane, non-magical object to be a span-read...\n- Back inside, the group discussed The Door once more. Speculating that it may be able to take its user anywhere, Magnus posed a question. If you could go anywhere in The Three Corners, where would you choose?\n\t- Sherman, who's thoughts were already on his past, chose [[Heliodor]] with determination, but later amended his answer to [[Woogis]]. More fondly the second time.\n\t- Magnus gave his answer too. A return to [[The Ward]], surprising no one.\n\t- Mal found himself unsure, but didn't discount the idea of being able to make a quick exit anywhere.\n\t- Cyrus nostalgically answered [[Gethsemane]], or possibly wonders beyond the six kingdoms such as the [[Keepships]] \n\t- and Deimos surprised the lot. He was exiled from the only place he'd want to go. When pressed about it, Deimos remained tight-lipped in the same way he always did when asked of his mysterious power.\n\t- Rozwald, however, didn't give an answer. The entire evening he seemed quiet and contemplative.\n- Later on, the ever-curious Cyrus decided to investigate The Door without notifying the group. On the other side he was met with a wall of tightly knit rope. Razmodius, The Rope Wizard, was keeping The Lumberjack closed off on Morza's instruction. While his barrier was surprisingly effective, his tongue was not so well guarded. After a little prodding and a few boiled potatoes, Raz answered some questions about The Door.\n\t- This door is not the only of its kind. Apparently it is a nexus of great magnitude, inhabited by more than The Street Dogs, and the Sheh'sheraan. It was spoken of like a secret world. As an entity, they call this nexus of interconnected places \"**Elsewhere**\".\n\t- Raz's people also seemed to believe that there may be other nexus' of doors than Elsewhere.\n\t- When asked who Raz's allies were, the strange geezer panicked, dropped a quick goodnight, and closed The Door.\n- Sleep came shortly after, along with another dream. Mal found himself standing in a crater, much like that of the first shared dream. Knelt in the center was the half broken body of the warforged recovered from [[The Grand Nothing]]. It spoke a single phrase.\n\t- \"No peace until heaven burns.\"\n- A keyhole in the Automaton's face opened the dream up to a new location. The Lumberjack. However, it was not as Mal knew it. Inhabited and well maintained. Amongst the dining areas tables was the rest of the party, save for Rozwald. This dream was being shared like the ones before.\n- Realizing the implication, our heroes split into two groups and began investigating what was presumably a past version of The Lumberjack. Vacant save for the party.\n\t- The Arcane Door was present in the dream, but blocked by a bookshelf. Beyond it laid a vast and pitch dark void. The sole entity within was an individual that fled into the nothingness when our heroes spotted them. The mysterious figure had been investigating a moderately sized hole in the shape of a dragon.\n\t- In the tower's studio it was discovered that The Street Dogs were in fact not alone. An individual sat painting. Handsome, young and obviously bound by some ailment. He introduced himself as Therin.\n\t- He seemed elsewhere in his mind, but a bond soon formed as he made you \"breakfast\". He informed you that his husband, Fejn was the better cook but was away on an errand in the city.\n\t- Therin's paintings were lower in number than you expected. Incomplete compared the collection you were familiar with. They depicted solely local landscapes, lacking the world beyond Tenzentak.\n\t- In an attempt to divine as much as possible from the dream, our heroes asked Therin about Fejn's brother. This proved to be a mistake. As soon as the topic was broached, the dream began to collapse.\n- Our heroes awoke to find their fingers coated in dried paint, and Rozwald missing.\n- The Street Dog's artificer friend had made a quiet, melancholy, yet determined departure during the night. A farewell letter explained how he sought answers regarding his father, and urged our heroes not to follow him as he would one day return to their shoddy tavern. He left behind the group's bag of holding, and a small apparatum spider for Sherman that could produce wool.\n- After a morning of sorrow for their friend's absence, Mal began to wonder where the paint had come from, and tried to match it with something within The Lumberjack. In the studio he found a grim sight.\n- The very same painting Therin had been working on in the dream had been defaced by The Street Dog's very own hands. Words repeated over and over.\n\t- \"No peace until heaven burns.\"\n- ***Something*** was going on here. Despite appearances and chalking up things to intersection or coincidence, The Street Dogs were being pulled further and further in by some secret. Precisely *what* that secret was being the great question.\n- There was something to uncover here. Something possibly related to the Ahamatath‚Äî the killing of a god. A field of stones unturned. The Street Dogs needed answers, and there was no better person for that job than Professor Abacus Oleander...\n- **Chapter ends on the 25th of Spring, Mid Morning, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-32-Answering-the-Call":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 32 - Answering the Call","content":" - **Chapter begins on the 25th of Spring, Mid Morning, Annum 4466**\n - Our heroes were growing acquainted to the peace of the outer villages, and chose to invest the better part of their day into repairs for The Lumberjack. Repairing the Roof and tidying the Yard. Sherman's sheep-like maw being employed in a way that was arguably useful.\n - During the roof repair, a curious passer-by visited the ruined tavern. Jed Dent, the simple brother of the local priestess.\n - Jed proved to be one of the friendlier locals. Possibly too friendly. Jed stuck around and lent a hand to The Lumberjack's restoration. Leaving later on with the promise of more aid in the future should The Street Dogs have him.\n - Mallory finally told Magnus that the talisman Ul'Brek had given him was a mundane hunk of burnt wood from the shaman's fireplace. While frustrating, the revelation didn't much surprise the goliath.\n - Magnus shared his story with Mallory. The discovery of Viz, raising him, and the binding of their souls.\n - Soon, our heroes headed to the city proper for some shopping, and to investigate the messages received after winning The First Ring.\n - Magnus and Deimos met with Mandreg Rold, the Guild Mind leader of The Gilded Heart Mercenaries. A group of whose reputation was that self interested, yet effective warriors. Guild Mind Rold proved to embody this idea quite well.\n - Rold was in the process of putting together a large campaign in the Tenzenwood. A competitive dragon hunt in search of small [[Dragons]] with odd physical descriptions.\n - Cyrus and Mal had a much different evening. They'd been sent on a mysterious and trying scavenger hunt that had led them to jester named Marcelle, a tricky dice game, and an ugly pawn shop. In it, they received a specimen jar with a creature that had been surgically granted a second heart. [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s Second Heart, a legion of crafty spies, were trying to recruit them.\n - **Chapter ends on the 25th of Spring, evening, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-33-Second-Heart":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 33 - Second Heart","content":"- **Chapter ends on the 25th of Spring, evening, Annum 4466**\n- Mal and Cyrus had followed their mysterious note, leading them on a scavenger hunt ending with a beckon from The Second Heart. [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s spy network. Their only point of contact existing in the form of a unique whistle. The odd trinket beckoned and even stranger creature. A fey being wearing the disguise of a crow. It delivered them an address and exchanged whistles with them, a measure of rotating security for the elusive organization.\n- At the mundane address they met the Second Hearts leader. Guild Mind Froya Glovewort. Froya proved to be a matter-of-fact and precise woman. Froya offered the two membership and one of their bounty based contracts. Information on Lord Curtis Renaull.\n- Apparently Colin Coinge was not the only person with plans for Lord Renaull, nor was Victory Day the end of his story. At the same time during what would have been his assassination if not for The Street Dogs, both of Curtis' mothers were killed in an [[Airship]] accident. Curtis' biological mother is the estranged niece of Lord Lionel VanVeld. Richest man in the world and the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Holocene]]. Curtis' late mother had been one of the few people to openly oppose Lord VanVeld. There was an unspoken implication that the Alderian Seat had them killed.\n- According to Froya, Curtis' siblings were all in the palm of Lord VanVeld's hand. Curtis being the only, slight exception. Curtis had been trying to prove himself as a political leader without his uncle's help. A move to become significant within his family. It was why he'd come to [[Tenzentak]].\n- The Second Heart's working theory is whatever resources were being kept from Lord VanVeld would likely go to Curtis. Probably in hopes that the young lord's desire to prove himself, and honor his deceased family would be enough motivation for Curtis to hold tightly to the inheritance.\n- The Second Heart needs to know what is being kept from Lord VanVeld, and why it is significant. A bounty of 3000 gold has been put on the information.\n- Accepting their new role, the gang headed back home for a full nights rest. In the morning they full committed themselves to the restoration of The Lumberjack.\n- While the task didn't pose the same challenges as a dirty bomb hidden in the city, it was no simple effort to wake the sleeping giant that was their roadside tavern.\n- The task was difficult, exciting, educational, and communal. While The Street Dogs were still very much outsiders to Fox's Hollow, they were quickly becoming a fixture of the town. The local weirdos if nothing else.\n- This was not the only bond strengthened. Jed seemed to see the Lumberjack almost as a second home, and Mal had now been around with The Street Dogs longer than he had not. While Mal was still technically the new guy, he was as familiar as the rest of them.\n- The many days were not without their trials. They faced sweat, splinters, dropped tools, wild animals, and explosive bottles of cider.\n- There were also small wins along the way. Sherman discovered an old thieves cache, Magus discovered a recipe left behind by Therin, Deimos found the address of a useful supply grocer, and the overgrown garden still harbored many useful plants.\n- After the first few days of reconstruction, the pig roast was held. It was slow to begin, but eventually blossomed into a full blown gathering. Many familiar faces came as well as some new ones.\n\t- Doyle and Don, local ruffians.\n\t- Old Man Goose, a mean old codger who was surprisingly enthused about a local warforged.\n\t- Lady Mara, the eldest community member and neighbor to The Lumberjack.\n\t- and Lord Stoneshard, the despised local landlord and father to Rhea Stoneshard.\n- Having made themselves known, and at the very least tolerated, The Street Dogs resumed their efforts with newfound vigor. \n\t- Replacing the fallen chimney.\n\t- Purchasing a brand new arsenal of [[Apparatum]] for tavern keeping, waste management, illumination, and security.\n\t- Refounding the garden and its structures\n\t- Restoring the brewery and the workshop\n\t- An making modifications to The Lumberjacks floorplan.\n- All in all, it took the party fifteen days since their meeting with The Second Heart to restore The Lumberjack. During that time, our heroes took a few personal projects underway.\n\t- Sherman sought a tavernkeeper to run help run The Lumberjack and hold down the fort while The Street Dogs were off adventuring. Jed provided an enthusiastic helping hand. The whole search proved fruitless, but something else had been made clear. Despite Jed's challenges, his earnest demeanor and desire to help... well might be useful traits in running a tavern.\n\t- Magnus didn't let any of his downtime away from a fight let him grow lax. Despite working hard each and every day, the goliath spent his evenings training and jogging through the town. An endeavor that, over time, familiarized Fox's Hollow with him even more. Especially the more flirty members of the outer village.\n\t- Cyrus, ever mysterious, spent his time tinkering away with something in his room. A brilliant cast of lights sounds and swears coming from the crack in his door.\n\t- Mal took his free time to look into the pages from the Journal, fervently searching for something useful in [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, the departure of Academy mages had taken most of the accessible tomes along with them. Though there was one stroke of luck. A single, extremely rare text that had fallen behind a shelf was discovered. In it was a single example of obfuscated Feocaul with a translation referencing \"when the sky was still purple\". While the information held within the translation was not particularly effective, the key it provided would be.\n\t- Deimos took his free time to contemplate his challenges. He'd saved Cliffside square, to a point at least, and now was without leads. His life was more peaceful, but the darkness that stirred within had not left. In fact, it may have attracted an audience. Hiding at the edge of the rotting woods stood a ten foot tall, terrifying demon. A creature of [[The Wasp Eater]] who vanished before anything beyond its observance of Deimos could be gleaned.\n- A demon was not the only strange passerby.\n\t- Gideon Gain had rode out alone on horseback to bid our heroes farewell. The masked man was heading to [[Holocene]] by the day's end. Mal took the initiative to gaze within Gideon's mind. The arrival had good intentions, viewing the party as friends. However, he seemed to be strangely instructed to tell The Street Dogs of his next whereabouts. Before Mal could learn more, a presence within Gideon's mind forced Mal out of it and knocked him flat on his back.\n\t- Lady Kalimae Sky's cat also came by and turned out to... well... be able to talk. Chrysalis, or Chrys, seemed a powerful [[Fey]] or [[Fell]]. However, he claimed to just be a very driven cat. Chrys was the provider of Kalimae's powers, a gift given so the young woman could live a life of adventure. Unfortunately, Chrys felt that Kalimae was in a bad spot, and without friends. He simply stopped by to ask them to be her companions. When asked where she was, Chrys told them Lady Sky had returned to [[Holocene]] to prepare for her wedding with Lord Curtis Renaull...\n- On the final day spent preparing The Lumberjack for tavern hood, Sherman noticed something odd about the basement fireplace. A removable ash receptacle that hadn't been cleaned. A novel and useful thing. However, what was far, far more surprising was the hatch hidden beneath it. A hatch that seemed to pull on the air around it. A hatch, that felt like not only a hole in the ground, but the world itself. A hatch... that felt exactly like The Door.\n- Before Sherman could announce his discovery, a cacophony of arriving voices sounded on the first floor. Guild Master Helg Corsair himself had come with an entourage of his attendants. The debt for shooting Lord Curtis Renaull had finally come, and The Street Dogs would make up for it as bodyguards. Bodyguards leading the pretentious young lord across [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]].\n- **Chapter ends on the 40th of Spring, Early Evening, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-34-Paths-Ahead":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 34 - Path's Ahead","content":"- **Chapter begins on the 40th of Spring, Early Evening, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had been tasked with escorting Lord Curtis Renaull back to Holocene via the old, perilous roadways through [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]]. A job given by none other than The Guild Master himself in punishment for shooting a noble lord. This would clear their debt and pay a meager 250 gold. A journey that began the very next morning.\n- This put a unique hold on Sherman's discovery of The Hatch. However it did not stop the group's curious arcanists from peeking within.\n- The Hatch led into an eerie, overwhelming ruin of some great structure. Like the dungeons of a gothic manor house that had been transformed into a monster's nest. Terror poured from the hatch, giving Deimos a hint as to what lay beyond Mal's arcane vision.\n- Putting a pin on The Hatch for now, our heroes readied for their adventure with a late night supply run.\n- Once the group had gone to rest, Magnus was met with another dream. This time he was alone with Therin.\n- The Dream Lumberjack was certainly from another time, but that wasn't where the weirdness stopped. Outside, The Free Cities in their entirety had been replaced by a vast desert of purple sand.\n- Therin seemed different as well. Less reserved than before. He spoke with more candor about Fejn, and his knowledge of word bearers. However, Therin gave Magnus a slight warning. Telling the storm blessed that he and Magnus wanted different things when it came to Fejn.\n- Therin asked Magnus what he wanted from his questions and efforts. Ultimately Magnus wanted peace. This seemed to amuse Therin. Therin urged him to go see what achieving peace involved.\n- The Door opened within The Lumberjack's basement. Magnus approached it to find a vast shape within. An enormous copper dragon. The creature was bound by wicked chains and spikes. Its skin strewn with viscerally carved runes. The great beast begged for death. A once glorious being reduced to pain and rot. Its flesh decayed rapidly but its screams only worsened. Magnus obliged it, waking upon the moment his hammer struck.\n- In the morning our heroes met with their new travelling party\n\t- Lord Renaull, who bore a new appearance. He'd lost his arms but he'd gained a new seriousness. Likely contempt. Lord Renaull was less than pleased that The Street Dogs were his new bodyguards.\n\t- Curtis' attendant, or rather his minder, was a mage named Markenneth. An arcanist of The Ward in the employ of Lord Lionel VanVeld. Markenneth seemed to have established authority over this travelling party.\n\t- Lastly was Captain Murdoch. An unfriendly sell sword who'd been hired by Markenneth for their venture. He'd brought along four other men in his employ.\n- The group set out awkwardly, and no one seemed keen on socializing beyond their immediate allies. The lot ended their first night at a tavern where Mal sought information about their new travelling party using Slug, and some cognitive exploration.\n\t- Captain Murdoch seemed concerned about their venture, and was contending with traitorous thoughts of selling Lord Renaull if it would save his skin.\n\t- Reading Markenneth seemed unwise, but though his window the use of a particular spell was spotted. Parse, one of the skills needed for the translation of the journal.\n\t- Lastly Mal read Curtis who he'd found crying. The young lord had been overwhelmed by the last week. He'd been attacked, humiliated, manipulated, used, shot, blown up, dismembered, and now he'd lost both of his parents. All to be travelling back to Holocene on foot in the company of those who outwardly disliked him. Curtis didn't seem to disagree with their feelings towards him. Though at his core, a dream of the future pushed the troubled lord forward.\n\t- The second day passed with little challenge, but on the third day their journey was beginning to weigh a bit. Noises in the woods, saddle sores, and dislikable company had rubbed away everyone's outer layer and people were beginning to get annoyed with each other. Curtis and Markenneth most of all were at each other's throats.\n\t- Mal, seeing the opportunity, jumped to befriend the possibly useful, yet arrogant mage. Managing to secure himself at least some \"engaging conversation\" with Markenneth at camp later.\n\t- Curtis, surprisingly sought out Sherman. He tentatively asked the automaton questions about what it was like to be a free warforged and even went as far as to apologize for his unkindness towards Sherman, and his involuntary part in the victory day attack.\n- At the day's end safe camp was being sought out before the group crossed into The Brambles. A dangerous section of The Alderian Planes. Unfortunately shady, and aggressive travellers using the same roads made this a less than amiable endeavor.\n- Before a proper camp could be found. But something else was discovered. Palce, The Highwayman.\n- **Chapter ends in the late evening on the 43rd of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-35-The-Dangers-of-the-Wilderness":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 35 - The Dangers of the Wilderness","content":"- **Chapter begins in the late evening on the 43rd of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had encountered Palce, the highway man. An arcane bandit leading a rag tag battalion of scoundrels. All seeking Lord Renaull's kidnap.\n- The ambush bloomed into a violent battle, exposing traps, hidden assailants, and no shortage of attackers.\n- Palce himself fought similarly to Cyrus, employing magical tricks and clever circumventions of attacks.\n- There was also a second named attacker. Silk, a skilled archer. The woman remained distant during the fight, shouting commands down at her grunts.\n- There were losses on both sides. The bandits sacrificed a good number of men, but The Street Dogs only lost two of their horses. Those belonging to Cyrus and Curtis. Equally troubling, much of the groups supplies were lost as well. The missing horses took theirs with them and Magnus' steed had kicked off its pack during a horse theft attempt by Palce.\n- The fight was loud and chaotic, drawing the attention of something sinister. A monster of the woods known as a Slaad. An intelligent, powerful, and obsessive creature belonging to the category of [[Demons]]. The Slaad proved capable of devious magic and swallowing bandits whole.\n- All hell broke loose, and the party made a run for it. Tearing across the Alderian planes, weaving between brambles and hills.\n- A tail of determined attackers nearly caught up, but a wild heard of buffalo and one of Deimos' smoke arrows made for a convenient getaway. Unfortunately, Magnus and Markenneth were separated from the rest of the party.\n- At camp, Lord Renaull had a full blown panic attack. He'd envisioned a difficult journey back to [[Holocene]], but nothing more than a tale that would make him seem rugged and brave. Kidnappers numbering in the tens and creatures from the Void was not on what he'd hoped for.\n- After a calming effort from the party, Curtis realized that The Street Dogs were the only people truly on his side.\n- The floodgates opened. Apologies, admissions of dreams, insecurity about his betrothal, and all his regrets came loose. The hot air in Curtis head leaving in a rush and for the first time the pompous noble seemed like a genuine person. A far cry from likeable, but it was a start.\n- The group made contact with Magnus via bells. Ensuring everyone had found some form of refuge, the party bedded down for the night. Only to be soon woken by the triggering of Mal's arcane alarms.\n- Silk the bandit had come to make a deal.\n- **Chapter ends in the extremely early morning of the 44th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-36-Off-the-Beaten-Path":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 36 - Off the Beaten Path","content":"- **Chapter begins in the extremely early morning of the 44th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Silk, one of bandit leaders had found The Street Dog's camp.\n- She'd come not for violence but to strike a deal. While Curtis' head was worth thousands, more than enough than the thugs on their payroll, Markenneth also had a price on his head.\n- She didn't divulge who wanted him dead, nor why they'd pay for it. But if The Street Dogs agreed to betray him, and turn over the Mage to her it may be enough to salvage at lease some of the chaos.\n- The price on the Hossian mage's head could persuade Palce, and a few others to abandon their mission. Leaving the rest of the bandits to naturally dissolve without their leaders.\n- The group felt skeptical about the deal, so Silk opted to leave a signal firebasket arrow with Deimos in the advent they decide to go for her plan. A flare to bring her to their position.\n- In the morning the pair separated from the group, Magnus and Markenneth, quickly found topics for argument. The group was now low on supplies and tensions were high.\n- Their bickering revealed something off about Markenneth. A saddle bag of his disturbed during Magnus' breakfast preparations that Markenneth seemed oddly protective of.\n- The group made plans to reconvene via bells and a few things occurred in their search for one another\n\t- The larger group found Bandits wounded during last nights fray. Hiding in a ditch. One had succumbed to their injuries and their singular horse had died of exhaustion. They spooked off the survivor and harvested what rations they could from the dead animal.\n\t- Magnus and Markenneth rode mostly in silence, but eventually cleared the air. A mutual dislike of [[Hoss]] and the shocking revelation that Magnus was a catalyst for conflict in the north seemed to balance out relations with the pretentious wizard.\n- Wall'e did the bulk of the work, reuniting the group via Magnus scent. Unfortunately, the relief of their reunion was short lived. Passing travellers with unknown alliances tainted the afternoon with distrust. They still had a long way till [[Holocene]].\n- Hunting trails led the group in a slow crawl towards the outermost edges of [[Rails]]' ruined villages.\n- Fresh bandit corpses were spotted amongst a small family of skeletal buildings. One slumped nearby sported strange pair of puncture wounds, and extensive bruising.\n- Using Slug to scope the place out, Mal's familiar found itself face to face with a cowering, brutish bandit. Whatever fight had occurred was not yet over.\n- The ruin's conflict was stoked like a hungry fire as The Street Dogs entered the fray. Tearing down walls and igniting the flesh of bandits.\n- Suddenly, the fight's mysterious third party entered the engagement. While it was indeed a monster, it did not belong to the forest. Blood, the warforged had seemingly also heard of the price on Curtis' head.\n- He was thrilled by the party's arrival. The hunt was now far more interesting.\n- Blades and arrows sung through the air. Curtis and Markenneth both suffering brutal wounds. The mage most of all. Having suffered some of Blood's poison.\n- Things were looking dark for anyone who wasn't the overzealous assassin. Mal called for order amongst the panic. Pleading for an alliance with the bandits.\n- While the notion of fighting alongside their targets was unusual, the logic was sound. The bandits joined forces with the party.\n- The tides of combat swayed, and suddenly Blood was left at a great disadvantage.\n- Soon, the assailants scattered in all directions. Two of the thugs and Blood barely surviving the fray. The Street dogs were left with possession of the ruins.\n- They made camp in the battle torn space. Opting for familiar cover rather than braving more unknown wilds.\n- The party now had ample opportunity to best the feverish, unconscious Markenneth. He couldn't stay awake let alone fight off The Street Dogs. And Curtis, who was also well off to bed, would be none the wiser of their betrayal. They could rummage through his belongings, steal his spell book, and turn him over to Silk before second moon.\n- However, honor won out. Mostly at least. They did opt to search the sleeping mage's suspicious saddle bag, finding an old, well-used journal wrapped in Markenneth's travel clothes.\n- He'd been researching the reawakening of [[Dragons]]' for some time now. His education at [[The College of Hoss]] had gotten him close to a dark secret.\n- Markenneth had fled the school in hopes to uncover the truth before something bad had occurred. The politics, science and society of dragons were complex things. But Markenneth seemed confident someone was intentionally waking dragons in hopes to stir [[Zelatt]]. Possibly to spark a repeat of [[The Dragon War]]. \n- Markenneth seemed to think Lord Lionel VanVeld, [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Holocene]] had something to do with this.\n- There were also mentions of something else. A being called The Shaper. Markenneth knew little of it, but Deimos seemed to recognize the name.\n- In the final pages were diagrams of a relic that had led Markenneth to [[Holocene]]. An macabre deterrent. A dragon, bound in chain and wicked spikes. Its body carved with visceral runes. A crucifixion if there ever was one. A Dragonbane. The very same sight from Magnus' dream.\n- **Chapter ends on the night of the 44th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-37-Doomed-to-Die":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 37 - Doomed to Die","content":"- **Chapter begins on the night of the 44th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes were at camp, well into their difficult journey from [[Tenzentak]] to [[Holocene]]. It seemed their cargo, poor Lord Curtis Renaull, was doomed to die by [[The Trinity]]. Whether or not he deserved it. However, that wouldn't stop The Street Dogs from trying to keep the young noble safe.\n- Across the camp, the Mage Markenneth was recovering from a grievous wound from Blood, the assassin Warforged.\n- During the man's feverish sleep, our heroes decided to delve into his mysterious belongings where they discovered a journal detailing Markenneth's research into a category of ancient weapons called Dragonbanes. Relics of great power.\n- He seemed to think there was one in [[Holocene]], and his defense of Curtis was solely to keep it from Lord VanVeld's grasp.\n- In the morning, the group spotted tracks from a goblin scouting party, and made for The Longstream.\n- A makeshift raft was used to circumvent an ambush on the bridge. However, this didn't stop Palce's bandits from launching a ranged attack against you. Magnus' might and a well timed Slaad attack helped you cross with only Curtis getting dipped once or twice.\n- On the other side, the journey through Cliffover was no simpler. A lack of safe camp and evidence of nearby attackers keeping everyone on edge.\n- Eventually the party began to notice statues in the woods. Carved in strange poses. It wasn't till that night when Curtis was kidnapped by [[Goblins]] did the party figure out why.\n- Pursing the attackers back to their camp, they found their medusa queen. A powerful creature who seemed to enjoy taking trophies of handsome, young travellers.\n- Wasting no time The Street Dogs swung into action.\n- Deimos and Cyrus snuck up close, gathering intel on the situation. Lord Renaull had been seated on a stage while the medusa bore down upon him.\n- Magnus, leveraging his strong suits. Began running and yelling. Smashing through tents and huts, throwing the entire camp into chaos.\n- Magnus suffered not only a volley of arrows, but a gaze from the Medusa itself. His powers barely saving him from the effect.\n- Deimos, thinking quickly, fired a smoke arrow. Temporarily preventing the Medusa from using her power.\n- Cyrus, knowing his cue when he sees it, snuck up on to stage to grab Curtis and run.\n- Mal, Sherman, and a befuddled Markenneth finally caught up to Deimos' position. The Dreadslayer quickly filled his companions in on the Medusa's weaknesses.\n- Mal, thinking quickly, formed a mirror of ice and passed it to Sherman.\n- The warforged then fearlessly charged the fading cloud of smoke, mirror out.\n- The Medusa petrified. Instantly.\n- **Chapter ends on the very early morning of the 48th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-38-Fear-of-The-Dark":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 38 - Fear of The Dark","content":"- **Chapter begins on the very early morning of the 48th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had slain a medusa queen, and managed to convince one of her goblin underlings, Ghim, to join their quest.\n- Ghim, being a local to Cliffover, proved a useful and adept hunter. Securing ample rations from the forest.\n- The group, despite their road-weary state, made good ground towards Holocene.\n- Along a seldom used path, they spotted a familiar hat. One that belonged to Captain Murdoch.\n- Further along, a wounded woman was found. Claiming to have been an member of an attacked caravan.\n- The group was skeptical of her pleas, but Curtis was adamant with desire to help.\n- As expected, the woman soon transformed into the Slaad, and chased the group.\n- A chaotic retreat led into a swamp where they tricked the Slaad into a trap beneath the wetlands. Securing a safe exit.\n- Camp that night was moderately safe, but disturbing. Deep, unnatural shadows emanating the will of [[Observance]] seemed to watch the group. Hiding away from any magic used to examine them.\n- The next day our heroes had to cross The Willowcreek Chasm where they reunited with Captain Murdoch and his surviving men.\n- Murdoch claimed to know a way across but his ill intent was poorly hidden.\n- The Street Dogs clocked Murdoch's betrayal before it happened, and a fight ensued. Palce's men joining the fray.\n- Many bandits were killed. Some thrown into the chasm itself. Unfortunately, Ghim was met with that fate. Dying with honor.\n- Escape was required once again, and found in the form of an old druidic way stone. A relic that could open a portal to its companion when imbued with power. The group activated it, and Magnus pushed it off the cliff just before he went through.\n- The group found themselves at the bottom of the chasm. The destination endpoint having fallen in long ago. \n- Curtis had unexpectedly received a mortal wound in the fight, nearly dying. After being healed, he admitted through tears that back at the masquerade party it had been him who'd killed Mavis Morp and the servant woman witness.\n- Camp was made while Curtis stared off into space. The chasm providing what had been the most comfortable rest since The Hangman's Tree. However, those strange shadows returned. Watching silently.\n- Our heroes awoke on Fay'n, the fiftieth day of spring. Leaving the chasm via the better half of an old rope bridge. Using it like a ladder.\n- Rain made their final stretch to Holocene miserable, but not nearly as bad as the signs of violence along the road.\n- Bodies torn apart and cast into trees. Rubble and small craters left as evidence of dangerous magic.\n- Holocene and its outer villages were spotted in the distance, but the journey, and its perils, were not yet done.\n- The body of the Slaad was discovered. Its head entirely gone. Killed like a doll. Something far worse than the perilous demon was stalking these woods.\n- Shouts of terrified fleeing men chased the party into a dead end gully. And in the distance, a looming shadow darkened the sky.\n- **Chapter ends on a dreary night on the 50th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-39-The-Shadows-of-Zol":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 39 - The Shadows of Zol","content":"- **Chapter begins on a dreary night on the 50th of Spring, Fae'n, Annum 4466**\n- In the deep dancing shadows and pouring rain, our heroes were cornered at the end of their long journey. [[Holocene]] mere miles away.\n- Palce, Silk, and anyone who wasn't dead yet slid along with you into the muddy gully where massive shadowy creatures, demons, bore down upon you. Summoned by an individual clad in dark magic.\n- Something had come to ensure none of you made it to the [[Chalkstone]] city. And it had brought horrors from [[The Void]] to see its will done.\n- Differences  with Palce's crew were set aside and our heroes dug in.\n- Shadowy razor sharp claws, and hurled balls of black fire tore bandits to shreds and forced The Street Dogs into a corner.\n- Magnus found himself seized by the summoning being, who revealed herself to be none other than Lady Kalimae Sky.\n- Her known associations with mysterious entity's like Gideon Gain lent Magnus a modicum understanding, but he was ultimately confused at her appearance. Why and how the noblewoman had come to conduct mass killing was foremost amongst the groups questions. Unfortunately all she'd supply was the fact that she'd been sent to \"recover\" the situation. Magnus getting the impression that she was being tested somehow.\n- Kalimae had a collection of concerns. The Street Dogs survival, the shadow looming in the sky, and most of all Curtis' whereabouts. Keen on giving her husband-to-be a less than warm welcome.\n- Blood, ever the pest, entered the fray. Firing shots down at our heroes. Lady Sky confronted the warforged. Saying specifically \"You're not supposed to be here\". A statement that confused the warforged. Kalimae was evidentially a stranger to him. It was almost as if Kalimae saw his presence as a pollutant working against her goals. Her solution was to throw the assassin into the increasingly lethal fray below.\n- Markenneth foresaw the possible end, and told Mal he had a plan. Mal, trusting as he was at this point fell for Markenneth's trap.\n- The mage paralyzed Mal, stole his prosthetic arm, and forced him to wear the same appearance-altering ring they'd previously used to disguise Magnus as a bear.\n- However this time it made Mal look like Curtis. Blood fell for this disguise but Lady Sky was not so easily fooled. Taking flight after Markenneth who'd gotten away with the young lord.\n- Bodies continued to pile as the gully filled with water. Only Palce, Silk, and one of their determined elites staying strong.\n- Against the odds, the group managed to slay the demons. Leaving only Blood to deal with.\n- Blood went into a desperate rage. Speaking almost incoherently to Sherman as he displayed something within his core. A mechanism of concentric triangles bearing the ferroillumic symbols for attack, defense, and order at its vertices.\n- Sherman nearly died to the warforged, but The Street dogs prevailed. Killing the obsessive assassin and taking his head.\n- Palce, Silk and their friend made for the trees once they realized the real Curtis was nowhere to be seen, and our heroes went after Markenneth and Curtis.\n- It was the mages screams they heard first. They found him on his knees in a clearing. Curtis nowhere to be found. Lady Sky had been using her powers to torture him for information on Curtis location.\n- However, she knew it was already too late. Curtis would make it to [[Holocene]] after all.\n- Lady Sky executed Markenneth and allowed Mal to search the body. Retrieving his arm, stealing Markenneth's journal and his spell book.\n- She apologized to them for all the mayhem. Telling them to give up on Curtis. He **will** be killed, and they cannot stop it. \n- However, Lady Sky's people seemed to think killing him outside the city was paramount, as now something called the law of Familial Death would come into play if were to be killed in Holocene. Triggering an investigation that would spark large scale chaos.\n- Keen minds amongst the group realized the pattern of Kalimae's behavior and powers. Haith had been the inheritor of fire, it was likely that Kalimae's command over shadow came from a similar place. Chrysalis may grant her some powers, but what she exhibited in the gully was beyond what they'd even seen from Haith.\n- Mal, unable to help himself, delved into Lady Skye's mind. Finding the determined woman to be furious at herself, frustrated with her circumstance, but glad the party made it through. Not just because she is fond of them (Magnus especially), but for a deeper reason.\n- For some purpose, Curtis' death was important. Necessary. Mal couldn't see why but he got the impression that The Street Dogs survival held an even greater value that the arrogant noble's assassination.\n- **Chapter ends on a late night on the 50th of Spring, Fae'n, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-4-Flew-the-Nest":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 4 - Flew the Nest","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early evening on the 13th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes are attacked by a massive Baby Rok whilst trying to recover a damaged Warforged.

The zipline so carefully placed by Deimos was hyper-extended and forced to detach.\n\t- Sherman, with his sudden courage had jumped out of the nest, but caught himself in the air\n\t- Magnus, ever fearless, went for a last ditch effort. Climbing into one of the discarded skimmers he forced it out of the nest into a free fall. Grabbing Sherman, and praying to [[Adrathar]] the skimmer could eat their momentum.\n- Magnus' instincts paid off, and the plummet only resulted in some terrible bruising and maybe a cracked rib. \n- Despite the chaos, you were successful in your journey, and recovered the Warforged\n\t- Within its clutch, a strange and enticing drawing of a broken sword\n- Our heroes ventured off at top speed away from the dangerous Rok nest to find place to rest.\n\t- Magnus, ever curious, asked his new friends about their pasts.\n\t- Sherman, in his battle shock seemed to emit music that he was unaware of. When asked about he promptly denied it then broke into song\n\t- The group finally acknowledged that they all shared the same dream\n- The general consensus was that the group should keep it a secret, but maybe tell Professor Abacus. He seemed trustworthy, and was the provider of your quest.\n- Regardless of what the group was to do, none of our heroes seemed to know what hand of fate gave them all the same dream, and put them in the same place.\n- During travel the next day, our heroes were finally met with the Sandstorm and a skimmer ambush. The Ger'zar bandits once again.\n\t- Their \"Autonom\" obsession continued\n\t- And the attackers posed a more than challenging fight\n\t- However, the battle seemed to include more than just the lot of you. It was of a larger scale as Deimos could make out the sounds of distant fighting in the storm\n\t- Suddenly, strange and unknown allies appeared above. A witch and a rifle wielding man flying on some strange, high-hovering skimmer\n- They fought with you, but you skimmer didn't last long. It resulted in a perilous crash into the canyon's depths.\n- **Chapter ends mid day on the 14th of Spring, 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-40-Inheritor":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 40 - Inheritor","content":"- **Chapter begins on a dreary night on the 50th of Spring, Fae'n, Annum 4466**\n- Rain drenched our heroes as they stood in a clearing, a few miles outside of [[Holocene]]. Lady Kalimae Sky, the presumed Inheritor of Shadow and the recently made corpse of Markenneth their only company.\n- While she'd been a more than effective killer, Lady Skye hadn't been successful in killing Lord Renaull.\n- Concerned for the party's wellbeing, not just out of out of mission but compassion, she begged the group to let Curtis face his inevitable death.\n- Lady Skye seemed to believe in her cause, despite hosting obvious discomfort. She warned, once again, against looking too closely.\n- Magnus asked if Kalimae's people had something to do with the Ikas Feather. A query she did not confirm nor deny.\n- Departing from the intimidating woman, our heroes finally made it to the Gate Town. The Spring, as it was locally known. Finding it in a state of rainy celebration.\n- Flowers and costumed citizens danced drunkenly through its lively streets.\n- One amongst the crowed sized Mal by the shoulder, revealing himself to be a very terrified, but somehow alive Lord Curtis Renaull.\n- Lord Renaull was hastily escorted to the Pale Ward's gate where his custody was finally assumed by Holocene itself. Only after his identity was confirmed by an eclectic Lord Shopswain or \"Shopsy\" as the common folk knew him as.\n- Shopsy invited the weary party to his tavern, The Wooden Flute, where they found themselves absorbed by the festivity.\n- Familiar faces in the crowd emerged. Palce, and his skilled companion Gorin who'd fought off one of the shadow demons in the brawl they'd just escaped.\n- Palce, despite trying to kill them for a week straight, was now acting as if they were all old friends.\n- Having no lasting reason to fight the slippery man, begrudging drinks were shared. Palce struck a deal with the party for Markenneth's head in which he told them all he knew. It seemed a \"silver masked man\" had wanted Curtis dead, and The Ikas Feather had wanted him alive. Markenneth's death on the other hand had been sought by his old institution. The College of Hoss.\n- The party went on to engage in games of skill, and chance. None of which proved lucrative. Fortunately, the rest of the party was plenty enjoyable.\n- Lord Renaull, despite having been just brought back, had snuck out to find the party. Claiming that something had felt \"wrong\" at the palace and how he now wanted to celebrate with his friends.\n- On one of the tavern's upper floors, Sherman met a warforged who gave him a lodestone. Effectively a narcotic for Warforged. In a psychedelic haze, Sherman encountered something. The warforged they'd recovered from The Grand Nothing. However this time he was whole.\n- He seemed to be fighting through some barrier to speak. Desperate to tell Sherman something. He claimed that a certain \"He\" had shown him the location of the sword, allowing him to draw a map to it. However, now the warforged was desperate for Sherman to find it before whoever this \"He\" was. Sherman was pulled from the vision before he could learn more.\n- Sherman then went on to try an convince Curtis to escape with them. Leave his dangerous noble life. Unfortunately the young lord remained foolishly headstrong. Determined to do things *his* way.\n- On the highest floor, Mal requested a fable from a storyteller. One about \"The Word of Doors\". The old man, who apparently knew everything, spun a tale about Fennailial the Word of Doors and Alleramus the Hero of Five Words.\n- A story in which The [[Wordbearers]] of [[Old Zol]] lived in a utopian society, the only secrets unknown to them residing across The Infinite Sea. Alleramus, the foremost human, decided to cross The Infinite Sea to never return. Enlisting the aid of The Word of Doors.\n- Things grew dark when Alleramus inexplicably returned. They'd seemingly discovering something. A secret so terrible it turned the perfect hero Alleramus.\n- Alleramus razed their great cities to ash, inciting a conflict amongst mortals and [[Gods]]. Amounting to an agreement between Alleramus and [[The Watcher]]. An agreement that wiped the known world clean. [[The Undoing]]. \n- Some believe that only The Word of Doors, beloved by [[The Watcher]], was allowed to survive with those he cherished most.\n- As the hours grew smaller, The Street Dogs were pulled deeper into their drunken celebrations. No one noticed the intoxicated young lord slip away to climb onto the taverns high roof. A place to dance beneath [[The Moons]] glimmering light\n- Whether he was pushed, or simply fell is not known. But when the morning crowds found his body, Gideon Gain was conveniently present. \n- Gain welcomed The Street Dogs warmly, despite the grim sight. Asking them to accompany him to see The Alderian Seat himself.\n- Gain attested to have nothing to do with Curtis' precise demise, despite his apparent motives.\n- The Pale Ward itself was almost like a different city. Disturbingly clean and accommodating.\n- Gain had walked the party nearly to the palace when a disgruntled man, Vestivius, stole Gideon's attention. The man was furious with the mornings events and obviously blamed Gain.\n- Ushered into the palace ahead, our heroes got lost. Fortunately, a charismatic gardener named \"Lee\" helped them find their way.\n- Lee, despite his filthy attire, turned out to be the Larkish Lion of [[Holocene]]. Lord Lionel VanVeld himself.\n- **Chapter ends on a midday the 51st of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-41-A-Favor":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 41 - A Favor","content":"- **Chapter begins midday on the 51st of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had finally met Lord Lionel VanVeld. Uncle to Lord Curtis Renaull, [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Holocene]], and richest man in all [[The Three Corners]]\n- Despite the ugly start to the day, our heroes found VanVeld and Gideon Gain, evidentially in the lord's employ, to be more than welcoming.\n- Mal attempted to read VanVeld's mind, but found him to be under the effect of a Mind Blank. The lord hadn't seemed to notice Mal's attempt, indicating that he was under the protection of some arcane device.\n- Condolences, invitations to a feast, tailored formal attire, inner-city accommodations, piles of gold, and a favor from Lord VanVeld himself made for quite the apology.\n- The favor alone was quite the disorienting gift. An ask of VanVeld could get many things, and open many doors. Our heroes decided to think on this before making their ask of VanVeld.\n- However, a creeping sense of *wrongness* couldn't be shaken. As inviting as these powerful men were, their alliances and intents were still unknown.\n- After the city's lord departed, Gideon stayed back to answer any of The Street Dog's questions. He didn't give much away, but he did explain Vestivius' role.\n- The man was chief legal under VanVeld's rule. While Gideon held an obvious respect for the man, the two of them were rivals by nature.\n- Vestivius was responsible for allocating the Renaull estate after the family's recent string of deaths. He alone held the information about Curtis' unreceived inheritance.\n- After their meeting with Gideon, The Street Dogs spent the remainder of the morning enjoying baths and discussing what they'd learned.\n- After, They visited the Chalk Markets to indulge in the vast, complimentary goods as well as purchase some new gear. Deciding their next move over lunch.\n- Magnus and Mal opted to perform a thorough investigation of Markenneth's Journal. Discovering that [[Kerketh Academy]] had a campus in the city, and Markenneth thought they may be hiding something. \n- There were also mentions of caves under Holocene that house a disturbing moving wall of stone. Capable of killing whoever came in contact with it.\n- Whatever hid this *Dragonbane* Markenneth was looking for, he seemed to believe that it had some sort of protection. Hinting at [[Incana]]. \n- There was also a mention of something called \"The Anchor\", but the late mage didn't indicate what the name meant.\n- The rest of our heroes spent their time seeking the city's underbelly. A hope to uncover info pertaining to Curtis' death. Unfortunately they chose the wrong kind of underbelly. A section of [[Holocene]] inhabited by \"grinders\". A sick, addicted corner of the gate town.\n- Amongst the twisting alleyways something disturbing was found. A flayed body, evidentially dropped from above roof level. Deimos discovering perfume in its hair, indicating that it was likely not from this distinctly unwashed district.\n- Palce, who'd coincidentally passed by, was able to shed some light on their questions. For a price, of course.\n\t- He, and his gang, were essentially everyone who'd have sought Curtis' head. At least from the the outer city. Since they'd failed spectacularly, whoever *actually* killed Curtis was not from Palce's world. The outer and inner city were harshly separated even in terms of criminality. Only the main gate, or passages controlled by thugs connected the two worlds.\n\t- Palce suggested that if he wanted to know more, he would personally seek Vestivius.\n\t- The smarmy man was also able to shed light on the body they'd found. Supposedly they were one of the many ugly symptoms of this district. Horrible corpses that tended to show up from time to time. Nightmares that locals felt were better left alone.\n- Our heroes reunited and opted to look for the inner city's underbelly next. Potentially eavesdrop in a tavern.\n- On their way back to Windheath, someone bumped into Cyrus. A familiar face. Bellamine the Quick. A witch of The Ikas Feather.\n- **Chapter ends early evening on the 51st of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.768233373Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-42-The-Seat-of-Holocene":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 42 - The Seat of Holocene","content":"- **Chapter begins midday the 51st of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had bumped into Bellamine the Quick of The Ikas feather. They tried to tail her but unfortunately she lived up to her name. Disappearing into the crowds.\n- The encounter left them anxious. But they were forced to return to their primary task. Trying to figure out who killed Curtis and what the nature of The Dragonbane was. \n- They opted to go after one of Curtis brothers. A ploy to trick one of them into going to see Vestivius so the party could scry on their conversation.\n- Their path lead them to Scoreforged, a unique and arcane tavern focused on the high life of young and wild nobility.\n- Searching through the tavern for their mark, a few rumors were heard.\n\t- Many seem to believe that Lord VanVeld is sick, and will soon require a successor. This was already known, as it was thought to be Curtis' original motive for coming to Tenzentak. However the reality of it is much different when witnessed in Holocene itself. Naming a new Alderian Seat requires a vote. Meaning that upon VanVeld's death anyone could theoretically become his successor. However he is not just a big player in their game of politics. He's more like the playing field itself. His will shapes the region's future, even in death.\n\t- It seems three individuals are the expected seats. However, who they were specifically was not uncovered.\n- Their hunt for one of the brothers led them to sneaking into the VIP section of Scoreforged. It seemed Shanewir Renaull was with the highest order of courtesan in the city. A woman known as Lady Midnight.\n- In the VIP section Lady Kalimae Sky visited for a drink. As expected she was not happy to see The Street Dogs meddling yet again.\n- Despite that, she and Magnus entered into what would  likely be their most honest conversation yet. Lady Sky hinting at her organization's \"altruistic\" aim. She also couldn't hide her own suspicions of the forces that drove Magnus from The Ward, and even apologized for Curtis' death.\n- Upon the *conclusion* of Shanewir's appointment, the young lord proved easy pray in terms of goading. It took The Street Dogs all of three minutes to fool him into rushing Vestivius' office.\n- Cyrus was faced with the difficult task of finding one of Shanewir's belongings. Something that would help with their Scry. Most of what Shanewir left behind at Scoreforged is better unremembered. Fortunately he was able to recover a lightly used sock.\n- Upon successfully scrying on the lad, they were able to listen in on Vestivius' insistent denial of Shanewir's demands. The reading of the will would happen in two days. Until then, the document would remained sealed in an extraplanar space inside a box locked with three keys. One with Vestivius, one with Lord VanVeld, and one with Gideon Gain.\n- Vestivius was adamant that he didn't even remember what was on the will and that Shanewir needed to go home. While Shanewir believed the statement, our heroes were unconvinced. It seemed the Chief Legal was hiding something.\n- Deciding to press Vestivius in the morning our heroes took rest in their rooms where Magnus had another dream.\n- He was in the Storm Horizon once again, and was accompanied by Azshara. A powerful bronze dragon and mother to Viz.\n- They looked down upon the Dragonbane in disgust while Azshara spoke. She told Magnus of the pain to come. Something in the society of Dragons was turning. \n- The Three Corners was once home to dragons long before [[The Awakening]]. And most powerful of their kin had not returned for many ages. But should they learn of the disorder and humiliation of their kind over the last four thousand years, they may return and begin a second coming of [[The Dragon War]].\n- Azshara believed that Magnus, with his kindhearted nature and connection to dragons, could strike order before things would turn.\n- Before waking, she warned him of the challenges to come. And the fact that he would have to do things he would not be proud of.\n- In the morning, Magnus told the others and they set off to find Vestivius. They would have never been able to get the info they needed through normal means, but a blind siding question paired with Mal's mind reading found the truth.\n- Despite all the chaos and death over Curtis' supposed inheritance. The late lord was never set to inherit anything at all.\n- **Chapter ends on the morning of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-43-Die-for-the-Cause":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 43 - Die for the Cause","content":"- **Chapter begins on the morning of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes were left with more questions than answers after discovering Curtis was never slated to inherit anything. \n- More aggressive forms of investigation would be required to untangle the dragonbane's mystery\n- The palace seemed the next best bet. Both to cash in their favor with VanVeld, and to possibly find another lead.\n- A preliminary conversation with Gain created an opportunity to scry on the mysterious man. An attempt to catch him in private conversation with VanVeld.\n- And scry they did, finding Gain in discussion with the Alderian seat during the high lord's breakfast.\n\t- They were discussing doubts about Curtis' Assassination. Gain theorizing that people had been too hasty in their killing of the young lord. VanVeld rejecting the notion, claiming that their strategy to *force fate's hand* had been sound. Referencing a depiction of the young lord in which he'd lost an arm and was wearing an engagement ring.\n\t- Despite the perceived concern, Gain held an optimistic outlook. Claiming that they may be safe from the danger's of this secret with The Word of Fire in the city. This didn't seem to satisfy VanVeld, and he urged Gain to *delay him* as they were apparently not ready for the fallout of whatever was to come.\n\t- Gain, despite being previously introduced as VanVeld's subordinate, denied him. This frustrated VanVeld, but he didn't protest. Urging Gideon to keep his ear to the ground and emphasizing how crucial it was that they found the dragonbane before anyone else did.\n- Gain soon returned to the party and assured them that The Alderian Seat would meet with them soon. During this interaction Mal decided to risk reading Gideon's mind once more. However this time he knew better than to dig deeper than surface thoughts.\n\t- In this, Mal discovered a deep respect for the Word of Fire. With a hint of something else that Mal couldn't quite place.\n- VanVeld finally arrived and The Street Dogs made their ask. To have one of them granted title in Tenzentak. A slightly comical, but genuine request to which VanVeld agreed. Mallory Boseman would become a Baron.\n- After the brief meeting, VanVeld sprung a question on them in hopes to catch them off guard. Asking the party if they knew what a Dragonbane was. Cyrus squared up immediately with the truth. Affirming the subtle accusation.\n- This threw VanVeld off guard. He was unprepared for this specific line of conversation and didn't manage to make anything of the opportunity he created. Choosing instead to end the meeting abruptly.\n- On the way out, Cyrus doubled down. Catching up to Gideon and whispering in his ear \"No peace until heaven burns\". A phrase attached to the haunting somnambulant episode The Street Dogs experienced a few weeks ago. As always Gain's mask hid his face, but he did tell Cyrus that he was his favorite of The Street Dogs.\n- Pieces began rapidly falling into place. Our heroes scampering to a tavern to discuss their theories.\n\t- What if Valmore was behind all this?\n\t- What if their dreams were the gods pleading for help?\n\t- What if [[Ayamot]], the dragon god of justice, was next on the chopping block?\n\t- What if those behind the Ahamatath were seeking to unleash [[The Void]] and usurp the [[Gods]]?\n\t- And what could possibly be altruistic about killing a God?\n- While fact was unclear, one thing remained certain. The Street Dogs were in the middle of this mess.\n- Kerketh's Holocene campus held their next answers. Cyrus and Mal sneaking in under the guise of a new lord obtaining a tour of the academy grounds.\n- An old, slow, but kindly professor volunteered to give them a tour around the archives. Cyrus managing to slip away into the restricted section while Mal was forced to continue the torturous expedition.\n- The search was a grueling one, and required Cyrus to contact the others. Urging them to go to the dinner without him.\n- Hours later, he finally found what he was looking for. A record of something called The Reality Anchor. A colossal and ancient rotating ring hidden beneath Holocene. Influencing [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]] in extreme ways.\n- Academics found it many decades ago, but six years prior an earthquake sealed the known entrance and caused all in its close proximity to go mad and commit suicide. Since then no one has been able to find a suitable entrance to The Anchor.\n- Its winding interior is said to be filled with celestial guardians and aberrations. Most who explored it didn't return.\n- However, one path was deemed relatively safe. Unique as it held evidence of early post-awakening society.\n- During [[The Dragon War]], many records were lost or hidden by the destruction. Such as detailed accounts of the weapons made to defeat dragons. Though not all was lost. The Three Corners still holds legends of the horrors created during the [[First Age]].\n- A Dragonbane was hidden amongst the ruins. Left to be guarded by The Anchor's natural defenses. Defenses which had cut off the Kerketh Mages and tore apart their minds.\n- A madness which drove them to draw images and scrawl prophecies in the throes of death. All wrote the same thing.\n\t- Lord Renaull's death will open the way. Destruction will be his inheritance. The Comet's fraudulent fate will reshape the coming era. His blood alone will light the way. All things hinge upon the sickening death of dogs.\n- On the final page Cyrus found the images left by the maddened academics. A depiction of Curtis Renaull, missing an arm, fighting a metallic snake, and wearing a ring. Markenneth's ring.\n- A situation quite similar to one that Mal had found himself in not so long ago...\n- **Chapter ends on the evening of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-44-Did-You-Find-it-Yet":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 44 - Did You Find it Yet","content":"- **Chapter ends on the evening of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had set off to steal what information they could from Kerketh's [[Holocene]] Campus.\n- Cyrus and Mal sneaking in while the other waited nearby on the outskirts.\n- Deimos noticed it first. Two men, both carrying concealed weapons following the group.\n- Upon Mal's return and Cyrus' message to go on without him, our heroes took off in an attempt to lose the pursuers.\n- Not only were they successful in doing so, they inverted the chase. Sending Slug, Mal's discreet familiar, after them with the instructions to return if he saw something of note.\n- Cyrus on the other hand was successful in his mission deep beneath the academy's campus. Succeeding in stealing not just the evidence he sought, but two random books as well. As if to screw with the universe for no reason beyond general mayhem.\n- It wasn't long on the surface before Slug returned to Mal. His normally slow, and goopy form made excited and jittery. He'd found something significant.\n- The Street Dogs followed slug to an alleyway entrance near the back section of The Pale Ward. Both men who'd been tailing them earlier had been brutally killed and left in the darkness.\n- Being unable to discern much from the crime scene beyond these men having info on the party, our heroes made for Curtis' Honorific Feast. An absurdly lavish event that made even The Beast's Ball seem like a small get together.\n- Lord Shopswain managed to pull some strings so The Party could sit at his table. Giving them a good vantage to observe the event. At the head table with Lord VanVeld were some notable guests.\n\t- Lady Kalimae Skye and her Uncle Lord Kil Skye were dressed in funerary black.\n\t- And three foreboding seats sat empty. Based on past rumors heard and similar situations prior our heroes believed these seats to have been set for The Word of Fire and his entourage. Haith and The High Conflagrator.\n- Lady Skye signaled for Magnus' attention and met him out on the balcony.\n\t- She shared her story. A tale of neglect, abuse and running away. A journey that accidentally brought her to The Fell where she met her companion Chrys. Lady Skye holds no sentiment for religion or gods.\n\t- She asked if the party had found out about the prophecy regarding Curtis. She'd also concluded that it had been Mal in the depictions, not Curtis. She alone had come to the same conclusion as The Street Dogs.\n\t- It wasn't just information she sought to share with Magnus. The evening's storm swelled something within him. The distant power of The North's [[Greatwinds]]. Holocene is the only city outside [[The Ward]] to be struck by the furthest edge of its bands.\n- Back inside, the others stood over Curtis' casket where Chrys, Kalimae's cat sought them out. He felt bad about what had happened to Lord Renaull. Not but a week ago, he'd begged The Street Dogs to be Lady Skye's friend. Then she immediately tried to kill their ward/friend.\n- In recompense, Chrys offered a way to bring Curtis back. A [[Fell]] Shade trapped in a jar named Chempray.\n- Chempray was apparently an effective user of Magic, and only a little evil. He was however, limited by his form. If The Street Dogs could get him into The Reality Anchor, he could apparently make his form more permanent in The Prime. In payment, he would restore Curtis' life.\n- They tentatively accepted Chempray's offer and returned to the feast hall for dinner. At the beginning of the meal, Valmore, [[The Word of Fire]] made a grand entrance.\n- He gave a warm speech. Different to the one given in Tenzentak, but no less intimidating. And the core message was the same. A new presence of the [[Church of Three Fires]] in [[The Free Cities]].\n- Gideon Gain visited their table as well. An ordinary conversation ensued, at least no less ordinary than they usually are with Gain. However, Deimos caught a slight detail. Lines of blood, dried within the embossed designs of Gideon's silver mask. His scent, and attituded lent to him possibly being the killer of their tail earlier that evening. Though no one knew why.\n- In the middle of the meal a sudden assassination attempt occurred. An elven man tried to stick a dagger in Vestivius.\n- Unfortunately for the assassin, trying to commit a crime against an elite, A *human* elite, in front of The Word of Fire proved a difficult task.\n- The man, who the party recognized to be Keshe'vik of The Ikas Feather in disguise, was in Valmore's grasp before he could even raise the dagger. Fingers driven into his back, held aloft by his spine. Valmore incinerated the man instantly.\n- The dinner changed after that. Some grew afraid, some cheered, others simply left. However most held a face of well practiced propriety. As if an assassin being killed by a hero was some version of normal, and garnered nothing more than a respectful nod.\n- Before the party could make up their minds on what they thought of the dramatic death, Valmore strode right up to them and asked a simple question.\n\t- \"Have you found it yet.\"\n- What \"it\" was, he didn't specify. Their fear and confusion only served to annoy Valmore. He condemned them, saying \"The Trinity gives you purpose and you dally?\" and for The Street Dogs to \"Have it.\" The next time their paths cross.\n- Holocene felt like it had just doubled in danger. They needed to wrap things up, and get back to The Lumberjack before things grew uglier.\n- The Street Dogs ditched the party. Heading out into the storm in search of The Reality Anchor. Wherever the hell that was.\n- **Chapter ends on the late evening of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-45-Toying-with-Fate":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 45 - Toying with Fate","content":"- **Chapter begins on the late evening of the 52nd of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had fled Curtis' Memorial Feast in a rush after being singled out by Valmore, [[The Word of Fire]].\n- Hoping to wrap up their business in [[Holocene]] as soon as possible, they ventured blindly into the rain in search of Mal's fated entrance to The Reality Anchor.\n- It went about as well as could be expected. Stumbling around in the muddy, dark outskirts of the pale city with little direction. \n- The Street Dogs cased the last known entrance, sealed 6 years ago by an earthquake. Finding nothing beyond possible pursuers on their tail.\n- They ultimately decided to head back to The Pale Ward to rest and review their options. Yes, they may be under surveillance at the castle, but in [[Holocene]] it seemed as good a place as any.\n- Firstly, they discussed the logistics of bringing Curtis back to life. Morality, Curtis' will, and Chempray's trustworthiness all being indeterminate factors. Some wanted to give the late lord another chance, others weren't so sure. Nothing was decided.\n- Valmore's question still rung in everyone's ears, no one certain of what he wanted until Magnus and Mal had an epiphany. The drawing of the sword hilt. Holding it to candle light revealed not only a clue, but a communication.\n- Similar to before, when the drawing was held to sunlight and revealed a prismatic message, it shone clear words in shadow.\n\t- \"Its me. Don't let the fire take me.\"\n- When asked about its identity the shadow changed to show a single word.\n\t- \"[[Godkiller]]\"\n- An ensuing flurry of questions directed at the piece of paper revealed a few more crucial things.\n\t- It wasn't the entity that killed [[Giriam]], despite its name.\n\t- It is made from a fringe and little know classification of [[Magical Metals]], Morhin.\n\t- Most pieces of it were vaporized in the event that broke it.\n\t- And that the best way to help it was through Old Abby.\n- All in all, the conversation revealed more questions than answers. The... *drawing* if that was a good enough word for the entity, didn't seem proficient in communication. As if struggling with the arcane, yet rudimentary act. \n\t- It wasn't long before the paper stopped responding entirely.\n- Soon the group shifted their focus back to The Reality Anchor. It took a while to find direction and Magnus had to seek fresh air on the balcony after being hit with yet another bout of weakness.\n\t- Out there, it was noticed that the castle itself has a unique set of defenses. Possibly charged by the power shed by the [[Greatwinds]].\n- Mal and Cyrus developed a theory. Using what info they had about The Reality Anchor expeditions and Magnus' bouts of weakness, they were able to map out a rough semi-circle. \n\t- Mirrored, it seemed to describe a good estimation of the entire anchor. Part of which ran underneath where Mal had been attacked by Blood. Just like in the prophecy.\n- Rest was sought and first thing in the morning the street dogs would head out for the gully once more. Unfortunately for Deimos, the evening held different plans.\n- At a few hours past midnight, a wrapping on the window awoke the mutant. Someone had come to make a request. Pox, a demon of [[The Wasp Eater]]. The same one who'd been stalking him outside The Lumberjack a few weeks back.\n- Surprisingly, Pox seemed... friendly? The disturbing creature not only understood Deimos' secret plight, but thought he could help. Pox, despite appearances and poor grasp on common, was apparently a scholar. And his mentor was the god of plague. His ultimate mission was to extinguish the concept of life from the cosmos. An effort for 'true peace' apparently.\n\t- An effort that has been underway for eons, and would be for eons more. That... didn't make it seem any less evil. But perhaps hearing Pox out would be alright...\n\t- Pox had been tasked with watching one of Deimos' old friends. A witch who was researching a disease that caused red hands. Pox had abandoned his mission to research whatever it was hiding inside Deimos' mind.\n- Understanding the unlikelihood of he was asking, Pox offered Deimos a gift of information in order to garner some favor. A method to use his power to track The Dragon Bane and navigate his friends to The Anchor. Apparently, Pox knew of it and had been alive 'when it was buried'.\n- The next day our heroes purchased some spelunking equipment and headed out with hopes of finding the entrance. Weathering the unending rain, and stopping to give Markenneth a grave on the way.\n- There was no clear sign of an entrance. That was, until Mal was swallowed by a sinkhole, tumbling into The Underdark in a hail of mud.\n- Once the group had descended into the pit, Deimos learned that Pox's idea had merit. Finding general direction to follow through the nexus of caves.\n- After an hour of slow descent, The Street Dogs noticed they were being followed by VanVeld's men. Perhaps telling VanVeld you knew what The Dragonbane was wasn't the best plan...\n- Deep into the darkness Cyrus spotted something useful. The body of a mage whose field notes gave a practical view of life in The Reality Anchor and its dangers.\n\t- Divine monsters\n\t- Lethal paths\n\t- Warped laws of reality\n\t- And the fact that The Reality Anchor would apparently speak to its occupants and drive them towards peril...\n- **Chapter ends midday of the 53rd of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-46-Underdark":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 46 - Underdark","content":"- **Chapter begins midday of the 53rd of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes were braving [[The Underdark]] in search for The Reality Anchor. Pursued by VanVeld's dedicated soldiers.\n- It turned out it wasn't just the Holocene Guard on their tail. A familiar face dressed in Holocene Servant's Attire was spotted sprinting past. Spade the Elf and Cinder his brazen fire spirit were being chased by an enormous, heavily armored insect.\n- The Street Dogs were thrown into the chase. Fortunately, the group was able to create enough distance from it to cave in a section of ceiling. Trapping the mutated Ankheg beneath a pile of stone.\n- Once everyone finally caught their breath, attentions were turned to Spade.\n- The gruff drifter was initially reserved as to why he was following The Street Dogs through caves, kilometers below Holocene. For better or worse, Cinder's overheard not-so-secretive whispering let the first answers out. Soon, common goals and alliances bridged the gaps between.\n\t- After the train attack, some forty days ago, Spade had gone to join up with [[The Bladehammer Guild]]\n\t- His first assignment given out by Guild Mind Froya Glovewort. Tasking him to act as a spy amongst The Ikas Feather.\n\t- Spade was successful in joining the Ikas Feather. It seems he had done so the day after The Street Dogs had. The Ikas Feather not only knew he was a spy but informed him of an explosive device hidden within his Guild Slate, disarming it on his behalf.\n\t- Spade found himself in an interesting position. Having what felt like half membership with both The Ikas Feather and The Guild.\n\t- Spade didn't have time to settle into either before things took a turn on his first Ikas Feather mission. The Guild had located a dragon horde that had been presumed vacant and the Ikas Feather set out in hopes to snag the prize. The horde however was not vacant. A three way clash between the Ikas Feather, The Guild, and a Black dragon ensued. Ending with The Guild on top.\n\t- Spade was then 'rescued' by The Guild and told his mission with The Ikas Feather was over. He was brought back to [[Tenzentak]] to witness The First Ring Tournament, The Victory Day attack, and Valmore's actions.\n\t- He spent the next few weeks along side the many who worked to restore Tenzentak until he was found by The Ikas Feather once more.\n\t- Spade was recruited to help investigate, and cease a potentially dangerous prophecy in [[Holocene]] involving Lord Curtis Renaull. There, his leaders Ke'shevik and Bellamine were unsuccessful in their overall mission. Spade, having met them once before, was tasked with following The Street Dogs. \n\t- It all came apart when Ke'shevik tried to kill Vestivius in a Hail Mary attempt. This ultimately ended with him being killed by Valmore.\n\t- Spade, separated from his group and left with the option to run or stick with the mission, decided following The Party was his best option.\n- After sharing their stories, the party invited Spade to tag along. More help couldn't hurt and Spade seemed desperate for a leg to stand on. Spade also offered up a sample of writing he had from [[The Grand Nothing]], winning a bit of favor with Mal as this was the last item he needed to translate Feocaul.\n- Camp was made and their new ally settled in with Sherman. However, when Sherman went to explore a bit a taunting voice came from Spade's bag. A laughing being called Ben who claimed to \"understand the game now\".\n- After an uncomfortable rest, our heroes finally closed in on their goal. Deimos' predictive senses proving capable of tracking their moving target with near exactness. A perpetual sickness that struck Magnus reinforcing their success.\n- The Reality Anchor inhabited a colossal cave, bigger than Holocene itself. An ethereal dark purple-y glow hazing the air, inhabited by strange motes of soft white light. Creating an almost night-sky like atmosphere in the depths.\n- The Anchor itself was enormous. A giant, wheel shaped castle of pure black and white stone. Slowly rotating on its side, trapped in a potent, incanic forcefield. Many doors appeared on its surface. One presenting itself ominously for Mal.\n- **JUDGEMENT***, the word working its way into the mind of those who approached it. Manifesting almost like a word in [[The First Tongue]], but fainter. Weaker.\n- However, there was a sole exception. Spade did not hear this word, nor did the forcefield that barred the other's entrance (save for Mal) stop him. It simply burned away. Not just allowing him to enter but everyone.\n- The party entered into a structure hanging from beneath The Anchor. Chempray wasting no time, demanding to be released. When the party refused him, he simply shattered the glass of his jar and took off into the distance.\n- An Agoth, the worst of the creatures said to inhabit The Anchor, was spotted across a bridge that had been destroyed via what looked like a 1-5 Potentium explosion.\n- Opting to leave the scary angel alone, the party ascended to the next floor where a terrifying being stood in a ring of lights.\n- It acted as Judgment itself. Welcoming Mal as a guilty being, exempt from his jurisdiction to complete a task deigned by [[The Trinity]]. The others were apparently not allowed and offered a quick death. The Party rejected the offer and Judgement begrudgingly allowed them their choice and departed.\n- In the new chamber, ten emitters of light corresponded with symbols of the [[Zolaen Gods]] . Three were dark. The God of Agriculture and Fertility, The God of War, and The God of Dreams.\n- **Chapter ends mid morning, deep beneath Holocene on the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-47-The-Reality-Anchor":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 47 - The Reality Anchor","content":"- **Chapter begins mid morning, deep beneath Holocene on the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had delved into the mysterious Reality Anchor. A set of celestial ruins hidden beneath the city of [[Holocene]] that effect [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]]. A field of influence that spans kingdoms, doing who knows what.\n- Well, there is one known effect. A prophecy involving Lord Curtis Renaull and Mallory Boseman. This place, and the being who seems to act as its custodian speak of a greater and mysterious purpose for Mal.\n- Last we left off The Street Dogs were at a dead end in a room that held a circle of lights. Lights that corresponded to [[Zolaen Gods]]. Their states of illumination hinted at not just one, but three dead gods. Giriam, the god of war, and the god of dreams.\n- Mal speculated what the effects of other dead gods could be. Some theories thrown out were that [[The Bloodshed Presence]] is something that grew in the absence of a god of war, and the strange dreams you have been having were somehow related to this absent god of dreams.\n- In justification of his theories, Mal referenced the others original shared dream. Spade, who'd been previously unaware of this common vision, voiced that he'd also experienced the same.\n- All evidence seemed to point to [[Ayamot]] being the next on the chopping block.\n- 2 doors blocked the groups advance, and before the party could suss out a way past them, Cyrus dropped to the floor. Seizing violently, and emitting a dangerous cast of wild, illusory magic. It came to an abrupt end when his nesting doll absorbed his form. From it, faint words could be heard.\n\t- A woman pleading \"No, please stop. He's sick.\"\n\t- And the sound of a physical clash between men.\n- Alarm and concern held many tense minutes, but nothing could be gleaned from the doll. Deciding to rely on Cyrus usual, independent capability. The party returned their attention to more comprehensible and present threats.\n- Astraeme, the least dangerous of the hostile creatures to inhabit the anchor, could be spotted travelling through thin tunnel systems high above. A deft shot by Deimos and a powerful spear throw by Magnus won the party a crystalline key held by the creature. Opening a door ahead to what seemed to be the old Kerketh base of operations.\n- Evidence of the Academy's downfall at the Anchor, context to their discoveries, and a small green crystal protruding from a strangely preserved corpse were discovered.\n- The next chamber proved much more dangerous. Two Astraemor stood as sentinels before an altar of the black damning stone that guarded this place. A violent clash against the angels ensued with Mal as a primary target.\n- The celestial creatures proved not only dangerous but extremely sturdy beings. One seeming to manage a direct influence on Mal's Mind, Soul, or [[Vizir]] directly. Connecting him to the anchor as a whole, and making its nature known. This place is not just some ruins. Its a word, the sleeping and forgotten Word of Judgment.\n- With the party in a challenging spot, Spade fought his way to the altar. Discovering its purpose. Judgement here could be circumvented with a sacrifice. Blood and coin were not enough.\n- Bravery and stupidity are two sides of the same coin. And in this fated place Spade manage to land the coin on its side.\n- Slamming his hand down on the altar, Spade's soul was ripped from his body. This immediately slayed both Astraemor, and as far as a surgeon would be concerned, killed Spade.\n- However, this did not feed his soul to [[The Mortal Coil]] direct. Trapped in a sort of between state, spade was now one of the many souls held in judgement's forgotten prison. Able to move around its vast and magical innerworkings.\n- Here he saw many... *things*. While their forms were not exactly physical, the idea of what they were was somewhat understandable to him.\n- Structures and creatures within The Anchor as well as other souls trapped in the same state. All of which seemed like husks, uninterested in his presence. Save for one.\n- Impossibly, Spade met the soul of a solider that had *died before [[The Undoing]]*. A citizen of [[Old Zol]] who spoke Feocaul and Common.\n- There were a million different questions Spade could ask, but most pressingly Spade needed to figure out how to get back to his body. Apparently, there were other, more recently judged souls within The Anchor. The Kerketh Academics who died six years ago. It seemed that they may know something, should Spade be able to find their souls. However, this soul spade spoke to made it seem like that may not be so simple.\n- Feeling the need to garner some favor with this mysterious soul, Spade asked what this person wanted. They gave a simple, joyless response.\n- The death of all gods.\n- **Chapter ends on the afternoon of the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-48-The-Death-of-All-Gods":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 48 - The Death of All Gods","content":"- **Chapter begins on the afternoon of the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes faced a dark dilemma. Spade, newest of their group, had died to stop the Astraemor Sentinels. At least, that was how it appeared. His soul was still present. Trapped within The Reality Anchor.\n- Here, Spade's soul met that of Hemmel. A foot solider from before The Undoing.\n- Hemmel spoke of The Final War. When the world of men contested the [[Zolaen Gods]] tyrannical rule. Apparently they lived as beloved divinities of Zol. At least until it was discovered they were scrubbing memories and history at their discretion.\n- The mortals, with Wordbearers leading them and King Alleran at their head, sided with [[The Void]] and fought back against the gods. They found means to contest the them and succeeded in killing two. Alz, the god of war and Festae, the god of dreams.\n- Hemmel, unfortunately didn't possess much knowledge in terms of the god killings of old. Being the a soul of a simple man who died before [[The Undoing]].\n- Hemmel was killed by [[Giriam]], who'd used The Word of Judgement‚Äî The Reality Anchor itself as a weapon of mass destruction.\n- Back in [[The Prime]], the rest of the gang was taking a rest to gather themselves and try to find a way to help Spade. With Mal's new connection to The Anchor, he had suspicions Spade wasn't truly dead. Upon magically investigating Spade's body, they weren't able to deduce how to help him. They did however, find that he was not in fact a regular elf, but an [[Eladrin]].\n- This respite was interrupted by the giant celestial that had greeted them upon their first entrance to The Anchor. The Word of Judgement's avatar.\n- Mal demanded answers, and only some were forthcoming.\n\t- This place, The Word of Judgement, used to be the gate to heaven and hell. It had seemingly been replaced by [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- What had happened to Mal was a contingency Judgement had placed long ago. Something the celestial had instructed his angels to do on his behalf should the situation arise. Judgement's agency was presently limited, and he did not make it clear what he'd done to Mal.\n\t- Ordinarily, Judgement could end Mal's life and weigh his soul. However, an agreement between [[The Trinity]], [[Kaszu]], and [[The Watcher]] had decided that Mal's dalliance through time would be allowed so he could fix what had been done. An ominous task.\n\t- Mal would apparently be allowed past the restrictions that The Anchor placed on the rest of [[The Three Corners]]. Vision and agency through [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]].\n\t- It was also mentioned in passing that it was not [[The Trinity]] itself that had given Mal this permission, but its avatar. The Trinity, like judgement, was not allowed to act for some unknown reason. Apparently it had created a copy of itself long ago.\n- Within the walls, Spade sought an exit. Encountering The Dragonbane and what seemed to be living people in The Anchor's physical world. VanVeld's soldiers who looked only a bit less lost than Spade did. Here, Spade discovered that he was able to mess with the physical world.\n- Triggering some mischeif for the party's foes, Spade left the soldiers to their doom. Then finally found his friends. \n- A frustrating fiasco ensued in which Spade was able to discover that the green crystal he'd found earlier on one of the preserved bodies allowed him some agency in the physical world.\n- In an odd turn of events, Spade managed to inhabit the vessel of the preserved mage they'd found. After many minutes of uncanny discomfort, Spade decided to leverage a secret he'd held. Taking his true body, and an orb from his bag, Spade went to the next room for some privacy.\n- Here he unleashed Ben, a ten foot tall, finely dressed being of shadow. Ben, who seemed to have a sort of control over Spade and great power at his disposal, swapped spade back into his true body.\n- Ben urged Spade to get out of The Anchor as it was very dangerous. He claimed that the party would likely be fine if they were fated to be there. Ben did however whisper something under his breath. A scenario where even fate wouldn't decide the party's safety.\n- Slug, who'd been watching this secret ordeal was spotted by Ben and killed instantly. This triggered the sealing orb and Ben was re-sealed. This frustrated him, but he recognized the game now. If he got out he'd have to play by certain rules.\n- Regrouping, the party decided their next course of action. Heading into the door they'd cleared past the altar. Here they found a room of pillars and slates that had glowing images on them.\n- Each image, save for one corresponded with an event from one party member's life. The sole exception being an image of the room they were currently in. When placed in chronological order it opened the passage.\n- The images were\n\t- Sherman witnessing his adoptive farm-family being kidnapped\n\t- Deimos being sold as a slave\n\t- Magnus seeing a mimic in a cage\n\t- Spade holding a slave's doll mask\n\t- and Mal attacking [[Brass Taldora]] with some great, powerful energy.\n- The order made sense, save for one thing. The sequence didn't end with then room they were standing in. Mal's came from beyond the current moment. The future. He recognized it none the less.\n- **Chapter ends on the early evening of the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-49-Chased-by-His-Future":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 49 - Chased by His Future","content":"- **Chapter begins on the early evening of the 54th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Deep within The Reality Anchor, or Word of Judgement, our heroes discovered an undocumented version of the key crystals. A dramatic orange one floating just before one of the ominous black doors.\n- Choosing wisely to not enter the black door, The Street Dogs opted to brave the angelic structure's rooftop where they were assaulted by hungry ropers. Creatures who's grasping, dangling limbs not only pulled towards toothy maws, but towards the soul-severing black stone.\n- Here, the newest member of their rag tag group proved himself one more. Spade's control over fire going beyond mere destruction, he and Cinder repeatedly teleporting the party from the ropers' hungry grasps.\n- Once the turning complex had rotated far enough from the threat of ropers, they inspected the rest of the roof. Finding the top most section of a tower that threaded this whole section of the anchor, strange spires, as well as a skylight that looked down upon a worship hall filled with carnage, and a fearsome looking sword.\n- The Spires set our heroes on a minor scavenger hunt. They seemed to receive a set of they crystalline keys as inputs. The orange crystal acting as the largest and a second black crystal needing to be found at the expense of a fight with a mostly dissected Agoth left behind by Kerketh academics. A bout which also revealed Spade as a new bearer of a [[Death Scar]].\n- When the spires were eventually activated, they acted as a teleporter that lead to a sacred cache of some sort. A pure white crystal of great potential, Khan Keter, or in common, The Host of Judgement.\n- Venturing into the aftermath of the soldier's lost battle, a dying man recognized the party. They being the target of his mission. Apparently they'd been specifically sent by the Alderian Seat himself to 'stop' them. He died before he could explain why.\n- As our heroes inched closer and closer to The Dragon Bane, Magnus began looking more and more like death.\n- VanVeld's solders, those teleported by Spade's escapade within The Anchor's innerworkings, fought and died against a huge chorus of Astraeme and a mean looking Agoth.\n- Thanks to Spade's intel, it was known that in the room just beyond the gathering of angels lay their goal. Rather than risking a poor-odds fight The Street Dogs exercised one of their favorite maneuvers. Run like all hell.\n- In a death defying sprint across the massive chamber our heroes swatted away chokers, and dodged the grasp of the fearsome Agoth. Magnus managing to grab the odd sword on his dash through. Ae Hiairian, The Decider.\n- It sat there, like a monument to a darker age as the party tumbled into the room, panting, a bit bloody and somewhat strangled. A sickening sight. Crucified by great iron spikes, chains, and crude runes that seem to stand out against the darkness. The bones of a dragon. What little remains of sloughing skin dangling from tarnished metal bone.\n- And just beyond it, a great black door hung open.\n- **Chapter just after midnight of the 55th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-5-The-Hand-of-Fate":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 5 - The Hand of Fate","content":"- **Chapter begins mid day on the 14th of Spring, 4466**\n- A crash had left our heroes stranded deep in the Baradan Canyon\n\t- Where Ger'zar bandits had come back to finish the job\n- A fight in the dying winds of the sandstorm brought your unknown allies back to aid you.\n- They turned out to be Johnny Dogs and Bellarmine of The Ikas Feather\n\t- They apologized for the chaos and gave a spyglass as a gift of thanks\n\t- The Ikas Feather had set up and ambush and you had stumbled into the middle of it\n- Though it wasn't all smiles\n\t- Encountering the Ikas Feather is apparently \"dangerous\" almost as if when one crosses paths with them, something is fated to happen\n\t- They handle this danger through 13 strange yes or no questions\n- Your answers made them nervous\n- They want to bring you back to their HQ and put you through a more \"comprehensive\" test\n- Your safety was guaranteed, and you'd be paid lump sum for your troubles\n\t- They also promised to take you back wherever you needed to\n- Our heroes were teleported to Camp Ikas through Bellamine's power\n\t- Camp Ikas is another one of those strange and twisted ruins of the past\n- Johnny dogs locked our heroes in a barracks to rest with food and medicine.

A fight with the faction's champion.\n- In the morning you awoke to a challenge, an arena holding hundreds of Ikas feather members, Damian Ikas, and The Factions Champion, Kresh.\n- The crowd seemed to be on your side, throwing up their strange salute at you. Two interlocked thumbs and splayed fingers\n- You engaged Kresh\n\t- Those of you who got close immediately felt something from him\n\t- An influence you are beginning to become familiar with. Some call it power, some call it edgelessness, but whatever you call it. There is undoubtedly magic. Real and old magic.\n\t- The deep feeling he cause quickly transformed into something more than awe. A feeling of anger, and vivid memories of your past.

Just as they were about to reach the door to your present chamber, Cyrus' strange doll erupted with [[Collapsation]] magic. Punting him back into reality.\n- Everyone moved to either cover the door, or support Magnus. Save for Mal that is.\n- Time froze for Mallory alone, and the voice of Judgement beaconed him deeper into The Anchor. Faced with the possibility of answers, and visions of his once future, the [[Saen]] man ventured deeper. Seeking the privilege of arcane passage to secrets of The early [[First Age]], [[The Awakening]], and [[The Undoing]] itself.\n- Brought into the very center of The Word of Judgement, and thrust into a painful ritual, Mal saw beyond Zol's veil for the second time in his life.\n- His body changed. Imbibed by celestial energy as he knelt bloody before the old gates to heaven and hell. Between them a monument stood. It read:\n\t- I met a wanderer from the freed world\n\t- He condemned my acts and named me his foe\n\t- A damning with which I could not disagree\n\t- Others had named me king long before this\n\t- Before even time had defined its ceaseless soul\n\t- King shall be my end\n\t- Gaze upon my monument and despair\n\t- Knowing this will not be the last\n\t- Trinity, tongue, wretch and watcher\n\t- None will shake me\n\t- My name is Azrodymaeus\n\t- And I will suffer you all until the last star dies\n- Back in the Dragonbane's chamber, the other Street Dogs employed their every tact to see it broken. Sealing the great door to the chamber, and giving Magnus every chance to approach the rotting relic.\n- A split second before Magnus could smash it to pieces. A terrible, pained voice rang out from it. Begging for mercy. Demanding it. Magnus froze.\n- Just then, Mal's connection to the Anchor allowed him a modicum of control. Touching some power that emptied The Anchor into the sky high above [[Holocene]]. Street Dogs and Dragonbane alike.\n- Plummeting to their deaths once more, they decided to end the Dragonbane. It likely wouldn't survive the fall. Magnus ripped one of the great metal spikes from its spine, and strength rushed back into he and Viz.\n- A panicked discussion ensued. Sherman had the capacity to save everyone but one person. They argued it out to the very last minute until Spade recalled then fact that he could turn into a bird.\n- Splashing down into the cool, polluted water of Holocene's gate town, they gathered their wits.\n- As if on queue, something terrible began to occur. Dragons attacked.\n- The city's demeanor changed in a matter of minutes. The quiet spring evening soon became a mess of fire, screams, and panic.\n- A fellow adventurer was met. Heathro. A capable cleric of the watcher, keen on helping the citizens and not being alone in this mess.\n- Cyrus opted to scry on Gideon Gain in a hopes to catch some intel on the city's situation.\n\t- Gain was in the process of talking VanVeld down.\n\t- Ensuring him that Fire and Shadow would probably see the situation handled.\n\t- VanVeld made a passing comment saying how it was clever *he* used the street dogs.\n- Opting to seek out Kalimae as their next best option, The Street Dogs found a crush situation at the city gate.\n- Some clever deception on Cryus' part got them through the crowd and into Holocene proper. Once close enough to the door, it only took a single enchantment from Sherman to get the crowd flooding in as well. It wasn't pretty, but it was certainly better than the alternative for the flood of commoners.\n- The Arcane walls of Holocene itself fought back against the draconic foes. It even scored a grave wound on the elder-most of the attacking dragons. Unfortunately the same dragon was able to create a giant hole in the defenses as it fell.\n- Hundreds of people ran in every direction in the luxurious, maze-like city. Our heroes opting to take the rooftops as a means to avoid the crowd. Here they reunited with their opportunistic friends Palce and Veil.\n- The inner city provided little safety now, and hundreds more were soon to die.\n- During their search for safety, a voice manifested in Deimos' mind. Exactly like his own but somewhat muffled. It told him to look through the gaps in his senses, search for safety where terror wasn't present.\n- There were two obvious points of safety. A cathedral of The Watcher, and Palce.\n- Crowding everyone they could inside, Palce opted to try and pick the Catacombs open so the masses could hide underground.\n- Small formed dragons soon attacked. Their bodies a mess of strange inorganic shapes. One had a body of chalkstone, and the other's form looked like it was made from the remains of a silk merchant's wagon. Both had a strange imprint of a palm-less hand on them.\n- Someone had to protect the citizens. The Street Dogs, and Heathro, bravely ran into the burning streets to stare down the draconic foes.\n- High in the sky, passively watching the fray hung three figures. A mass of whirling dark, A beacon of burning flame, and the high priestess of the [[Church of Three Fires]].\n- **Chapter ends in the extremely early morning of the 55th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-51-Day-of-Dragons":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 51 - Day of Dragons","content":"- **Chapter begins in the extremely early morning of the 55th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes clashed with strange hand-marked dragons beneath the gaze of Valmore and his allies. All for the sake of a church full of strangers.\n- All around them Holocene burned, making the Victory Day attacks seem like a pleasant afternoon.\n- Heathro, a brave and well intended knight of The Watcher fought alongside The Street Dogs.\n- When the lesser dragons were defeated, the naive golden warrior sprinted to the feet of two word bearers. Fire and Shadow.\n- His pleas for aid fell on deaf ears. Valmore said he'd already seen this city burn. Heathro's last act was criticism of two of the most powerful beings in Zol.\n- A tendril of shadow flayed his body. Leaving it on the cobbles like the corpse our heroes had found a few days prior.\n- Valmore displayed his displeasure with The Street Dogs and their failings to serve his vision. Setting the church full of survivors ablaze, and demanded bodily sacrifice from one of our heroes. All for failing to deliver him the sword, Godkiller.\n- Kalimae was chosen to take Magnus' arm. In a meager last ditch effort, our heroes opted to use illusion to try and trick the small gods. Cyrus wove arcane falsehoods to protected Magnus' flesh. Even paired with Kalimae's good acting, it wasn't the most convincing act.\n- Strangely, Valmore seemed entirely satisfied. Dismissing The Street Dogs with yet more demands for The Godkiller.\n- The Street Dogs sprinted for the inferno, using all they could to save those trapped in the collapsing building.\n\t- Spade's dominion over fire allowed him to hold back a modicum of the flame. A strange, and unfamiliar interaction between him and his magic.\n- Palce did all he could to crack the door to the crypt. It was only the hope he provided that kept the nervous masses waiting for salvation. Magnus' foot proved a much better key.\n- A hysterical river of low and highborn citizens poured into the cold stone tunnels that ran beneath the city. Dank air a much needed relief from the shouldering hellscape above.\n- The party moved with the masses. A hope that whoever led the charge knew of another exit. As they walked, strange noises from Curtis Renaull's grave caught their attention.\n- Curtis had died, gone to damnation, and returned. The absence of his missing arm had been replaced by a shadowy appendage bearing the face of Chempray. The two would seemingly need to get used to one another.\n- Curtis followed once more. Returned from the dead he could never go back to his old life and was in more need of direction than ever.\n- At an intersection between the crypts and some low level of The Pale Ward, city guards were reestablishing order with the survivors.\n- Gideon Gain and Lord VanVeld also took refuge in the lower vaults. Cyrus' magic and social deduction made it clear something had the two allies at odds regarding what was happening to the city.\n- Gideon offered The Street Dogs safe passage out of the city if they didn't get involved.

Magnus was dead set on confronting the wounded dragon.\n  - And confront he did. In the smoldering streets of Holocene, Magnus stood before Hethrogon the Golden. Making a case for the city's salvation.\n  - Hethrogon lent his ear to Magnus, but would not accept the pleas of a lesser being. This day had been \"promised\" to the dragon, and it would serve vengeance on behalf of Ikgoras. The being who long ago became the dragonbane our heroes had successfully destroyed.\n  - Hethrogon deduced something unique about Magnus. A sixth sense shared amongst dragon kind saw through the surface of the goliath's powers. Magnus was apparently no storm blessed.\n  - The ancient dragon granted Magnus one mercy. That this would all be over soon. The golden god-like creature spared the party and rushed The Pale Ward with aims to destroy the palace.\n  - It was time for plan \"b\". The group broke off in two.

Buying mere moments of safety for the palace.\n  - Even with all his power, all his might, Magnus was taking too long. In a last ditch effort, he put all the magic he had not into his muscles but into Viz. A vision from the perspective of Viz flashed in his mind. Magnus' body dead at the feet of [[Adrathar]]. Something in the little dragon *changed*.\n  - More than half The Street Dogs were buried beneath rubble. Hethrogon mere seconds from finishing them all. They braced for the end, but their would-be final thoughts were interrupted by the sound of beating footfalls and claws against cobbles.\n  - Magnus, riding more than half dead on the back of Viz who now stood taller than a horse, came tearing through the smoke. Wielding the glowing power-source like a lance.\n  - In his final moments of consciousness, he drove the object into Hethrogon's wounds.\n  - As the sun broke the horizon, wicked and orange through the smoke.

He had apparently used his magic to find some \"thread\" that connects the party to the Ikas Feather as was explained by Damian Ikas.\n - According to them, the thing they fight is some grand, mysterious source of injustice. Apparently so wide in its influence that it had played a role in the darkest part of our heroes lives despite the fact the party had been recently spread all across The Three Corners.\n- This enemy is of a unique nature. Supposedly its influence is one of Information. And speaking about it in the wrong way is dangerous. Hence the smoke and mirrors with the Ikas Feather.\n- Normally the party would have been invited to join the Ikas Feather, but Damian was fairly certain that our heroes may unknowingly be part of the enemy's plan.\n- Rather than have them join, Damian suggested they play things carefully.\n- He gifted the party a large sum of money, a new Flatpan [[Skimmer]], a way back via teleportation, ensured you that there would be allies in back in the new world watching over you, and warned you about looking too closely.\n- Before departing, Damian pulled Cyrus aside. He seemed to know something about Cyrus, and warned him about the path he was taking.\n- The party was sent back to the lower lift, returned their skimmer (or rather they replaced it), and ascended back up to Tenzentak.\n- Upon our heroes arrival, Deimos sensed someone hunting them. Bennet Frence, in search of answers regarding the Train Attack. Likely looking to arrest you before you became full fledged guild members.\n- Though the cocky mage was no match for Cyrus' mischief. The mysterious man got our heroes to Professor Abby before Bennet could spot them.\n- The Professor was overjoyed to see the group back so soon, congratulated you on your success, and gave you your slates. Marking you as official members of [[The Bladehammer Guild]].\n- He also spoke of the dramatic state of affairs with the recent Train Robbery, and was surprised to hear you had been there when it happened.\n\t- He showed our heroes the body of one of the [[Warforged]] that had attacked the train. Given to him for a second opinion by one of the crime's investigators. A guild member named Persephone.\n- The Warforged the group had brought back from their adventure (rather... what was left of it) was stowed in the back room\n\t- and without a moment to spare!\n- An unexpected visit from Haith Nallian, the Inheritor of Fire. Unannounced the terrifying young warrior strode into the room. He sought the body of the [[Warforged]] our heroes recovered.\n- Luckily, The Professor's circumstances, and quick thinking we able to deceive him. He showed Haith the body from the Train Attack, rather than the one recovered by our heroes. The Professor bluffed and Haith bought it. The Inheritor promptly destroyed the cadaver then left without a word.\n- Awestruck at the encounter, the group took a long moment.\n- They decided to fill Old Abby in on the situation as they understood it. And with the professors help, the group decided that they were going to try and uncover this mystery.\n- Old Abby sent them off with a warning about Bennet, urging them to cooperate if he asks to bring them in, but remind him that they are now guild members and that he cannot detain them without a proper named order.\n- The party then went about the city, getting thrown out of The Sheathed Anvil due to Rozwald's dramatic actions, emboldened by alcohol.\n- Then they decided to slum it up in the lower city, and were thrown out of Threck's Alchemy when Rozwald drunkenly harassed a fellow patron that seemed to be up to no good.\n- Finally, they took their pocket change to Deangelo's Collections to sift through the odds and ends\n\t- The party found a few things of expensive interest and Cyrus stole a more than interesting set of keys.\n\t- Then Rozwald got them thrown back into the streets once more when he tried to steal an Arrow-Catch.\n- On their return to the upper city, they bumped into a figure Rozwald recognized.

However, it seemed too illogical for Cliff to acknowledge it, and Rozwald was intoxicated and acting abnormally.\n- Eventually, the discomforting moment fumbled itself into a reunion. A reunion that shocked Cliff. He had been heading home after work, he asked to meet them for a drink in the next few hours.\n- Back at the Sheathed Anvil Tavern, the party discussed Haith, and his strange nature. They also discussed their ages. \n\t- Determining that Sherman was at least 56, likely older. \n\t- Rozwald at 30\n\t- Then Deimos at 25\n\t- The youngest was Magnus at 23\n\t- And as always, Cyrus withheld his personal information. Teasing and mysterious.\n- Cliff arrived at the Sheathed Anvil\n\t- Things began awkwardly. Fortunately, the tension was transformed from social anxiety to confused worry when Cliff acknowledged the elephant in the room.\n\t- As far as Cliff knew, Rozwald had died four years prior. There had even been a funeral.\n\t- Rozwald's father had left [[Tenzentak]] some time ago to expand his empire.\n\t- He had begun a business of [[Warforged]] Manufacturing in the West.\n\t- After the initial shock, the conversation became one of a more ordinary reunion. Sharing stories of recent life, and tales of a young, curious Rozwald visiting the mines.\n\t- Encouraged them to go see his family manor, hopefully to find his father.\n- The group asked Rozwald what the hell was going on. Rozwald seemed genuinely baffled. He did recall encountering an assassination of an individual who looked just like him back in [[Ryze]]. He was pretty sure he had heard the thugs use his own name too.\n- They decided to rest up, and visit the manor in the morning.\n- They caught a carriage and headed south to the Rozwald Estate. A more than lavish mansion.\n- Upon their arrival, the guards were not trusting of their claim. However, a little magical persuasion on Cyrus' part got them to call for Haefus. The head of staff.\n- Haefus could not hide his shock when seeing the unmistakable heir to the Rozwald Empire. It was if he had seen a ghost.\n- Invited inside, the encounter equally as awkward as it had been with Cliff.\n- Told to stay as long as they wished.\n- Unfortunately, the Lord and Lady of the house were not within The Free Cities. Though Haefus said he would put out a communication.\n- Elephant in the room, Rozwald was supposed to be dead.\n- Taken to see grave. Told there was no body, merely a headstone. Next to it was the headstone of Egan Alzby, Lord Rozwald's late colleague. An equally empty grave as Egan had died of [[Materiation]].\n- As the morning went on, Deimos was getting an increasingly bad vibe from the estate and Rozwald couldn't help but feel Haefus was acting oddly.\n- Sherman decided to excuse himself to the bathroom, a strange thing for a warforged but the help were in no place to deny him.\n- Sherman promptly tore the toilet out of the ground and slipped in between the walls of the manor where he heard Haefus speaking to the staff.\n\t- He told them to \"Put that away, we can't act until we hear from Lord Rozwald.\"\n\t- He also heard them say \"I knew we shouldn't have believed them without a body.\"\n\t- and finally \"Make them believe they can lock their doors at night.\"\n- Sherman slipped away and found the group in the swimming pool. After much awkwardness, he convinced them to go to the hedge maze where they could be filled-in privately.\n- They decided to look for answers breaking into Lord Rozwald's office, kicking in the door.\n- Inside they found a shelve of records, a desk, and a vault hidden behind a painting.\n- The records dated on the year of Rozwald's supposed death were stolen by Deimos.\n- Rozwald attempted to break into the safe, but was too overwhelmed and anxious. His normally steady hands made shaky.\n- Cyrus was able to fool the staff into making it look like the room was not broken in to.\n- Sherman in his endless espionage expertise , yanked yet another fixture out of the wall. Then promptly threw the safe out the window where it struck a gardener, and broke open.\n- **Chapter ends midday on the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-8-You-Can-Never-Go-Home-Again":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 8 - You Can Never Go Home Again","content":"- **Chapter begins midday on the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- The chapter began with our heroes gazing down at the safe they had thrown out the window. It had struck an unlucky gardener, and burst open.\n- The group quickly hopped out the window, and began recovering what they could. Deimos, Rozwald, and Cyrus salvaged the safe's contents while Sherman and Magnus hid the gardener's unconscious body.\n- A group of guards came to see what the chaos was, but Magnus and Sherman were able to trick them. Buying the others enough time to gather everything from the safe.\n- The group then ran, and started ascending the manor wall. Unfortunately, the were spotted. The previously distracted guards turned and began to pursue.\n- After some difficulty, the party was able to clear the wall and run through the woods.\n- To their dismay, the guards had been waiting all morning for the order to dispatch the supposed \"imposters\". Our heroes disorganized fleeing attempt was not swift enough to evade the well prepared guards.\n- The pursuers caught up with the party, and a battle ensued. The guards put up a mean fight, but due to the party's resilience, and restraint, they were able to knock a few unconscious, scare some off, and force the remaining attackers to surrender.\n- Their leader cursed them out. He didn't seem too intermingled with the mysterious ongoings of house Rozwald, so his information wasn't too useful.\n- Though the guards did share one thing as a sort of thanks for sparing them. Apparently, the Noble Lord Rozwald's way was not one of due course. They likely wouldn't report the threat to the [[Tenzentak]] authority. An assassination to tie up loose ends was more likely.\n- The two groups sprinted off in different directions, our heroes heading to [[Tenzentak]] once again. They eventually stopped at a group of [[Chalkstone]] monoliths to go over what they stole\n\t- A large sum of money.\n\t- A few commissioned drawings of what seemed to be the Lord Rozwald's mistresses.\n\t- A firearm\n\t- And a set of complex [[Apparatum]] schemas relating to [[Warforged]] Production. They were titled the \"Failsafe Precaution\"\n\t\t- They included a small blurb of writing that said the invention was quite promising, but needed quite a bit of work. The design, in its current state, apparently made them a bit mad, and repetitive.\n- Additionally, the documents stolen by Deimos were extensive, and disorganized. They would likely take hours to parse through.\n- Not knowing what to make of their discovery the party returned to [[Tenzentak]] where they found the festivities were continuing to grow.\n- Amongst the now crowded city, they discovered a mystic's tent, offering many services such as fortune telling, and the uncovering of secrets.\n- Cyrus, being a man of many secrets, encouraged the group to check the tent out. Inside they met a mysterious, sliver tonged wood elf wearing an elaborate mask.\n- He offered his services to our heroes, even giving them a free fortune reading using [[Tarot Cards]] to broker good trust. Drawing:\n\t- The Tower - signifying intense and sudden change, release, painful loss, tragedy, and revelation\n\t- Strength - signifying courage, compassion, focus, persuasion, and influence\n\t- and The High Priestess - signifying inner voice, unconscious, divine feminine, and security\n- The mysterious mystic then prodded Cyrus, saying he could smell a secret in his pocket. A set of keys. He would tell them where the keys went, given they did something for him in exchange.\n- The stranger's request was odd. He had been tasked to attend a masquerade party, and ensure one individual had a very embarrassing evening. A man who would be wearing a silver fox mask. However, the stranger didn't want to go.\n- He asked the party go in his stead, and humiliate the silver fox a total of three times over the course of the party.\n- The offer was suspicious, but the party eventually accepted. He gave them the invitations for 8pm at Septurn Manor in Cliffside.\n- The mystic then divined the keys in an odd, and succinct ritual.\n\t- One went to an exterior door. A building in an outer village called Fox's Hollow.\n\t- The second was magical. It went to a safe somewhere within the building.\n\t- And the third was an anomaly. So purely magical, that the second key might as well be a stone in comparison. The stranger admitted to not knowing what the key was for. He seemed almost embarrassed his skills were not sufficient. The key was so wrought with informational energy, that it left the mystic's nose bleeding.\n- Their deal was bound, and the stranger told the party the best make good on it, or else. Sherman asked him his name, but apparently that was a secret for another day.\n- Upon exiting the tent, the party bumped directly into Bennet Frence. With two black eyes, and a furious expression, Bennet attempted to arrest the party.\n- Being full guild members, they were of equal authority to him. Meaning he could not arrest them. Though the heroes graciously volunteered for questioning. \n- They followed him to a relatively mundane guild structure where they were left in a simple room. Not long after, a tiny, odd [[Warforged]] entered. He immediately began calling the party \"Dog-fuckers\".\n- A moment later, an apologetic Guild Mind entered the room. Master Colin Coinge of Kerketh Academy. The creator of X12, leading guild expert on Mechanicum Immaculatum, and \"head of investigation\" on the train robbery. \n- Not long after, a third individual entered. A goliath woman named Persephone Drone. A Guild Mind, and Hillperson of [[The Ward]]. She seemed very disheveled and quite upset with Master Colin Coinge. Persephone introduced herself as the \"co-investigator\" of the robbery.\n- They went over what seemed like a very ordinary set of questions. However, a few things were revealed:\n\t- Master Colin Coinge is a colleague of Rozwald's father.\n\t- The acid inside the warforged in the attack was likely a secondary modification to their schema. It's real purpose was made to hide some primary modification upon death.\n\t- The acid was found to be synthetic shamblic acid, a substance invented and produced within the Guild Itself. It was a proprietary technology created by Master Willam Bellard. The same guild mind who had turned down the party's help upon their arrival at Tenzentak.\n\t- The Alshor, a group of local free-willed, peaceful, warforged had been imprisoned under suspicion of association with the attack.\n\t- And lastly, Persephone and Master Collin Coinge do not get along.\n- Towards the end of the conversation the party found themselves both accused and confused. Master Collin Coinge suddenly claimed to have it on good account that the party had attempted to tamper with the vault prior to the attack. Something the group did not do.\n- Worse, he claimed that a guard who survived 18 hours after the train had arrived back in [[Tenzentak]] attested to seeing them go into the vault shortly after he was wounded. This was all the more confusing as Deimos had checked the guards. Both were dead as could be.\n- The interrogation ended with high tempers, but no arrests were made. The master claimed to think they party may have somehow been involved, but weren't guilty per se. Instead, Master Coinge instructed the party to stay within the jurisdiction of [[Tenzentak]]. Not going beyond the outer villages. \n- The party, frustrated and desperate, left the room. Where Magnus, making the best of the negative encounter, attempted broker a relationship with the first person from [[The Ward]] he had met within the Free Cities. Persephone.\n- **Chapter ends on the early evening on the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Chapter-Summary-9-The-Silver-Fox":{"title":"Godkiller Chapter Summary - 9 - The Silver Fox","content":"- **Chapter begins midday on the early evening on the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**\n- Our heroes had just left their less than favorable questioning session with the Guild's team investigating the train robbery\n- Magnus begged Persephone for her aid. Seeking a [[Zephyrean]] priest, and a tailor suitable for a man of his size. She complied, giving him the name of a local called Ul'Brek, and a tailor called Madame Louseau.\n- The party went over their invitations and formulated a plan for the party\n\t- Magnus wore a Ram's head mask, and was pretending to be a Merchant's son of [[The Ward]] in the city on trade. Lord Belfo Brandic.\n\t- Sherman masqueraded as his brother. Sporting a cherubic sheep mask, and pretending to be Lord Casper Brandic.\n\t- Cyrus was to be a travelling scholar of [[The Brass Hall]]. A lord Mors Lapliar. Sporting a owl mask.\n\t- Rozwald would attend as Lord Aldo Aldo, a foreigner on looking to trade with the Rozwald Mines. He would attend in a mirrored black cat mask.\n\t- Finally, Deimos drew the short straw. Doing a great job attending as Lady Falza Mortimer, a fur trader of Kahdinacht. Sporting a white rabbit's mask.\n- They met the theatrical Madame Louseau. A tailor who specialized in creating finery for Adventurers. She gave them everything they needed to attend.\n- The party formed some ideas of how to mess with the silver fox. A spilled drink, a stash of porn, a slap to the face, and a defeat in a duel. \n- The group found rooms at the Immarum where they stashed their belongings, and gave Wall'e a place to sleep while they partied.\n- Deimos broke out the papers he had stolen from Rozwald Manor and began parsing through them. A few concerning things had been discovered.\n\t- Lord Rozwald was sending *a lot* of money to The Brass Hall in Ryze. More than what would have paid for Rozwald's schooling and allowance. He had been paying staff, distribution, and security sending money to a House Iostan. \n\t- The Lord Rozwald had made communications with a thug via span read. A criminal in Ryze who was locating and disposing of a \"lost package\" in the Rustways.\n\t- Finally, a letter received by Lord Rozwald from a mysterious individual who only signed themselves as \"G\". The told Lord Rozwald that he'd best stop his investments into artificery or he would kill him and his family in terrible ways.  \n- One by one the found the party discovering a thick net of rumor and intrigue. Nearly impossible to make sense of as an outsider at a glance.\n- It all seemed to revolve around Lord Curtis Renaull, nephew of Leonel VanVeld. Curtis is the target. His shiny silver fox mask making him stick out, recognizable as the same noble from the train attack back when our heroes first met 5 days prior.\n\t- **Lord Curtis Renaull's posse** was three strong.\n\t\t- **Lord Curtis Renaull** himself, in his glinting **silver fox** mask.\n\t\t- **Lord Bennet Frence**, the pest from [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. He had chosen a **red weasel** mask.\n\t\t- And **Lord Mavis Morp**. A  [[Zessgorn]] noble who seemed to be under Curtis in the social hierarchy. Mavis sported a **black bear** Mask.\n\t- Across the ballroom was **Lady Mae Preacher's Posse**. A large group of women from which 3 individuals stuck out. All [[Tenzentak]] nobility.\n\t\t- **Lady Mae Preacher** herself, wearing a **pink butterfly** mask. The current suitor of Curtis Renaull.\n\t\t- **Lady Gale Goa**. A plump dwarf in a **green frog** mask who seemed quite the gossip.\n\t\t- and **Lady Rhea Stoneshard**. A pretty girl in a **brown rabbit** mask who seemed quite smitten with Curtis Renaull.\n\t- The ladies were gossiping loudly about an outlier amongst the attendees. **Lady Kalimae Sky** of [[Holocene]].\n\t\t- **Lady Kalimae Sky** wore a **black cat** mask, dissimilar in its make to Rozwald's. By your best guess, Curtis had at some point had a negative romantic encounter with her, and he was still sore. Lord Mavis Morp, the black bear, had tried to make a move. He was met with little success.\n\t- Then there were **The Corsair Twins**, two Bladehammer Guild members, likely of some renown in attendance. They don't seem very fond of anyone who can't hold a proper sword.\n\t\t- **Bax Corsair**, the brother. He wore a **yellow hawk** mask\n\t\t- and **Adja Corsair**, his elder sister. She sports a **white badger** mask.\n\t- Finally, the gracious and very drunk host **Lord Grant Septurn's Posse**. Grant seemed friendly with all, even those who didn't return the sentiment.\n\t\t- **Lord Grant Septurn** wearing a **grey wolf** mask\n\t\t- and **Rione Elsitor**, the lord's current boy toy and supposed dragon slayer from [[Hanen]]. His legacy advertised by his **red dragon** mask. The poor, humble warrior seemed very out of his element.\n- Encountering these individuals was like walking through a social spiderweb. Their rumors sticking to you. Magnus, charming as ever, managed to gain a sliver of favor with the controversial Kalimae Sky. Telling her he had been sent to harass Curtis Renaull.\n- **Chapter ends on the evening on the 16th of Spring, Annum 4466**","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.769233378Z","tags":null},"/Godkiller-Premise":{"title":"Godkiller - Premise","content":"The death of [[Giriam]], the Zolaen God of Agriculture and Fertility, has thrown [[Zol]] into an unprecedented era.

They affect society by communicating with, or granting power to mortals. Some gods even take a mortal form to move amongst society. These influences can be well intended, or malicious in nature.\n\nThere are many gods that exist in [[Zol]], all with different intentions, morality, and powers. Some gods are supremely powerful, while others are limited in comparison. \n\nThe gods themselves have complex relationships with their peers that are not well understood by the civilizations of [[Zol]], society has organized them into pantheons to better discuss them.\n\n## Main Pantheons\n\n| Pantheon | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| The [[Zolaen Gods]] | The creators of [[Zol]]. A pantheon of gods who act with [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their king. Doing everything they can to see his image of [[Zol]] come to fruition. |\n| The [[Wayward Gods]] | Beings of [[Zol]] who are of great power and influence, but do not see [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their ruler, nor do the commit themselves to any other group. They act on their own accord. |\n| The [[The Wandering Gods]] | A group of alien beings who appeared to mortals after [[The Undoing]]. Mysterious in nature these gods not act like the others. Some think they caused the [[The Undoing]], other think they are guardians; protecting mortals from the dangerous whims of other [[Gods]]. |\n| The [[Void Gods]] | Beings who hate [[Zol]]. They crawled out of the [[Sea of Monsters]] to destroy [[Zol]], and return it to the chaotic feast of power it once was: The [[Sea of Monsters]]. |\n| [[The Trinity]] | Some religions like [[Trinaism]] and [[Ashian]] see [[The Trinity]] as a deity. However, most other groups see it as a force. |\n\n## \"God\" as a catch-all term for powerful beings\nThere are many beings who's primary focus is to rule over some dominion as a God. However, these are not the only beings that society refers to as a god. While academia may have rigid criteria for godhood, society may see any being or force of extreme power as a god.\n\n## Minor vs Major Deities\nMinor Deities are beings who have a great deal of power that gives them a degree of uniqueness and domain over some aspect of [[Zol]]. These beings have the ability to not only influence their domain, but give power to other beings to carry out their will. Sometimes these are called *Small Gods*.\n\nMajor Deities are beings who are vastly more powerful than most other beings. Their power and influence is only kept in check by other Major Deities with a contradictory will, or the great efforts of coordinated less powerful beings. To these creatures, a single mortal is but a blip in the cosmos. \n\n## Small Gods\nA loosely defined academic term equivalent to Minor Gods, the title *Small God* is given to beings who are seen as being at the pinnacle of mortal power, or the bare-minimum of godhood. Mostly this consists of beings like:\n- [[Wordbearers]]\n- Grand Insightors of [[The Kybis Assembly]]\n- [[The Paige of Cups]]\n- [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]]\n- [[King Galliard]] due to his influence over [[The Crown Titans]]\n- The [[Hags]]\n- Members of [[The Coven]] or [[The Cult of the Mothers]]\n- Heroes of legend\n\nHowever some philosophers who write about individuals like Lord Leonell Vanveld of [[Holocene]] as if they are a sort of Small God due to their extreme wealth, or other power they posses. In short, the term *Small God* is not a quantifiable level of influence. It is instead a descriptor used to illustrate the assumed level of one's power, and note the fact that they bear god-like influence.\n\n## Wordbearers\nMortals who have achieved the ability to harness [[The First Tongue]] are known as [[Wordbearers]]. They are considered gods by some. It is not known how many [[Wordbearers]] there are, but the ones who are publicly known play a large role in society.\n\n## Cosmic entities\nOutside of [[Zol]] and its planes, beyond the [[The Great Wall of Roots]], there lies an infinite cosmic expanse. Almost nothing is known of what lies beyond [[Zol]], but it is understood that the world of [[Zol]] itself may be the dead body of one of the cosmos' progenitors.  This idea is enforced by many [[Religion]]s.\n\nThese progenitors, known as the [[Great Old Ones]] once ruled the cosmos, or at least a large portion of it. However, they were driven away from their former power by some reality bending event. All of what is known about these beings is considered to be legend or speculation.\n\nThese beings are known of, but bear little modern significance in the day to day lives of mortals.\n\n## Religion\nA complicated topic in a world with so much power, so many gods, and so little that is understood. \n\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] takes many shapes and forms.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.770233383Z","tags":null},"/Gohzul":{"title":"Goh'zul","content":"See [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]] or The [[Great Old Ones]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.770233383Z","tags":null},"/Gohzul-The-Abyss":{"title":"Goh'zul, The Abyss","content":"One of [[The Circle]]'s inheritors.

The loss of memory from [[The Undoing]] is responsible for [[The Triumvirate]] no longer being able to harness their innate magical gifts.\n\n## Origin of the theory\nOriginal speculation came from archeological finds in [[The Grand Nothing]]. Artifacts from these finds never mention any race other than those of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. Biographical content in these artifacts tells of these races all sharing centauries long lifespans.\n\nThese causes for very polarized beliefs amongst the races of [[Zol]]. Especially when paired with modern history, beliefs, and cultures. However these beliefs are only held by a percentage of the population.\n\n## Social Issues\nDue to this theory, many believe their race is superior to other. Causing discrimination, racism, war and slavery. Many [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] think they are better than [[Humans]], and [[Off-Human]] [[Races]]. Then there are [[Humans]] who think they have dominion over the [[Off-Human]] races as their progenitor. Those who suffer most are the [[Off-Human]] races pushed into slavery, or those like [[Changelings]], who are banished to the edge of [[The Three Corners]].\n\n[[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] have historically blamed [[Humans]] for everything. Many members of the two races who are said to still bear [[Great Magic]] believe it is their mission to relearn the old ways of [[Magic]], and gain their lost art.\n\n## Evidence Against Great Magic\nMany adopt the belief of grand magic to support their bias. However just as many, if not more disagree.\n\nThe issue of longevity could be explained by the advancement of technology created by society in [[The Before]]. Meaning [[Humans]] were only able to live as long as other races due to medicine and [[Magic]]. \n\nThe origin of the [[Off-Human]] races remains a mystery, but most argue that the origin of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] is unknown as well. The fact that their history is know back further does not prove anything to the origin of the other races. Other [[Races]] like [[Fairies]], and [[Lunite]] do not have a known origin. New races have even come to be such as [[Kenku]] and [[Warforged]]. This indicates that [[Zol]] is likely not limited to [[The Triumvirate]], and it probably never was.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.771233389Z","tags":null},"/Great-Old-Ones":{"title":"Great Old Ones","content":"A Great Old one is a mythical, and unique progenitor being of the cosmos.

Residing within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Hanen is the smallest of the Alderian cities, but has a reputable history. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. The rebels of Hanen did not have the numbers that were originally needed for its defense. The rebels had overthrown the city, but were expected to lose it against the armies of [[Kapesh]] in the coming assault. Reinforcements could not cross the expanses to support the rebels within Hanen, as South Kapesh was crawling with enemy troops.\n\n![[hanen.png]]\n\n[[Kapesh]] attempted to retake take Hanen by siege, and failed. So they tried again, and failed. They even made for a third attempt and against all odds they failed. It was at this time support from [[Holocene]] arrived. Kapesh would never lay a boot on Hanen soil again.\n\nHistorians and tacticians speculated at what gave Hanen the means to defend their city for so long, but the most concrete explanation is the citizens of Hanen fought exceptionally well. The core reasoning for this exceptional fighting became prevalent over time.\n\nSome people of Hanen posses strange abilities, locally known as 'gifts'. A rare phenomenon, with each individual case manifesting uniquely. These abilities appear as physical or magical boons of power. Some obvious example of one possessing these powers may be able to breathe fire, climb vertical surfaces, see through walls, or manipulate the arc of a thrown object. More subtle manifestations appear as great skills. Some may not even recognize they have a 'gift'. No individual is known to posses more than one power.\n\nTypically these powers are passed down a bloodline with an approximate 1 in 3 success rate. However some citizens may be born with new power at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. The abilities first appear around age 10. Historically the powers have been increasing in frequency and potency. Hence the past confusion regarding the strength of those from [[Hanen]], as the powers used to be quite simple.\n\nEmpowered bloodlines are heavily sought after in modern day. Due to this, most noble houses are 'gifted'. Most notably House Trent. The wealthiest family in which almost all family members are 'gifted'.\n\nThe powers of [[Hanen]] waver if a 'gifted' individual spends more than 10 years from the city, but return fully when near  the city once again. 'Gifts' cannot be passed down when birth occurs away from the city. Some suspect this is because the source of the power comes from the Glass Lake.\n\nIdentifiable by its ivy covered, weathered and off-white stone walls. Hanen is a quaint place, and recommended to any who travel. Due to Hanen's location and strong population, it has one of the safest outer wilds, allowing for expansive farms, and a sense of ease.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | A lucky few of the city's people are born with special powers called 'gifts' |\n| Main Challenge | The presence of these 'gifts' stokes an imbalance amongst the city's people. The 'ungifted' frequently experience mistreatment by some of the 'gifted'. The city's leadership faces many political hurdles in remedying this due to the high number of 'gifted' nobles.|\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Farmed goods, hearty meat-and-potatoes meals, wild game, ales and mead |\n| Export | Agriculture, Mercenaries |\n| Size | Small |\n| Outer Villages| Some |\n| City Leader | Lord Poe Abbarand |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Wanderer-Centric, Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Overgrown war-worn structures, Lakeside |\n| Architecture | Off-white stone walls, ivy covered, clay tile rooves |\n| Color(s) | Green and Gray |\n| Symbolism | A shield bearing three drops of blood arranged in a triangle |\n| Defenses | Lake-Navy, City Garrison, 'Gifted' Elites |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The wealthy and politician class, many of which have 'gifts' due to their family influence over time. |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The working class of farmers, craftsmen, and other service people. Most in the city live good lives, making for few beggars. The largest challenge these people face is the frequent tension cause by living in close quarters with 'gifted' individuals. Many of which have destructive or lethal powers, and a sense of superiority. Some common folk have 'gifts' as well. These individuals are frequently married into noble houses, or keep their powers relatively hidden to avoid social pressures. |\n| The 'Gifted' | Misc. | Locals to the city who are born with unique powers that grant magical or physical abilities. |\n| Church of the Wanderers | Religious | One of the largest congregations of [[Sworn Wanderers]] in all of [[Zol]]. Notable as much of [[Zol]] resists the Wanderer-Centric beliefs. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | The Citadel | Keep | The city's keep |\n | Church of the Wanderers | Church | A grand cathedral built in honor of [[The Wandering Gods]]. It is unique as most churches built to the honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] are humble in scale. |\n | East District | Market | The vast market district. Packed with many small restaurants and taverns. It notably contains no clear magic shop. Magical items can be found at various vendors selling odds and ends or Artificers' services. |\n | Wagons' | Tavern | A large and simple tavern. The most popular of its competition, frequented by the Common folk. |\n | The Lucky Few | Tavern | A higher scale tavern, frequented by the 'gifted' |\n | Sozaren Academy | Sword's College | An exclusive institution with the aim of training 'gifted' into skilled warriors. Located in Last Stand. Known to export remarkable fighters. |\n | Hanen Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Hanen Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The City's sole teleportation circle. Located in The Citadel. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by Poe Abbarand, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Hanen]]. Lord Abbarand is an old honorable [[Half-Elf]] man. Despite the cities culture and history, Lord Abbarand possesses no 'gift', despite his bloodline. He has always had a vision of growing [[Hanen]]. It is a small city with no shortage of resources and much potential.\n\nUnfortunately, he spends most of his time settling squabbles amongst the noble houses and cleaning up messes caused by the 'gifted'. Despite his honor and efforts, his inability to exercise his authority upon the 'gifted' has given him a reputation of being spineless.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Misuse of 'gifts' | Medium | If one uses their 'gift' to harm, intimidate, or manipulate another without due cause they are to be jailed in the keep's dungeon. (Note that despite this laws existence, it is rarely enforced. If it is enforced, the sentencing is usually very lax.) |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, Hanen is known for giving rise to many strong warriors that make an impact all across [[Zol]]. \n\nIt is also known to be a nice destination to visit. This is because of its safe location between [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Hanen]]. This allows one to venture out into the wilderness with little risk. A rare thing in eastern [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nKnown for withstanding siege during the [[Alderian Rebellion]] against impossible odds.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- It is expected in the next centaury, the presence of 'gifts' and their power will plateau.\n- Many 'gifts' give moderate power, but there are the special few who's abilities far exceed that of their peers.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.774233404Z","tags":null},"/Harengon":{"title":"Harengon","content":"See [[Harengons]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.774233404Z","tags":null},"/Harengons":{"title":"Harengons","content":"*The quick-footed*\n![[Harengon.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Harengons]] are known to be fast-talking, creative, and communal people.

The shops, inns, and other services are of the highest quality, and it is all built to cater to the needs of its guests. |\n| Main Challenge           | The city's original vision was a capital that could be present all over the massive kingdom. A place where the city's rulers could keep their finger on the pulse of [[Laenwalde]], and the people could feel watched over and cared for. However the tendencies of nobility have altered this vision. Be it consciously or unconsciously, the upper class always tend to push away the common folk to a comfortable arms length. [[Heliodor]] has become a place with the infrastructure to monitor and rule over the massive kingdom, or where nobility can live in luxury and ignorance if they choose. The latter is the most common. The city is very exclusive, if you are not a resident you require invitation to enter. Servants require a [[Flatkey]] to work within the city. Prices of goods and services are very steep to keep out riff raff, some formal invitations to the city even require cover costs of food, lodging, and provide a per diem if a guest is not well off.

|\n| High Nobility      | Social Class     | The top of the top within the noble circles of [[Laenwalde]]. High Lords, High Ladies, Merchant Tycoons, Guild Leaders, Upper ranking members from [[The University]], Military Leaders, Foreign Diplomats, and people of the like. The kingdom and city look to these people for direction. At the top of their hierarchy sits [[King Tatelak II]] and his Golden Council.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Nobility           | Social Class     | The vast majority of the city's locals and visitors. Those who are of great import to the kingdom, but do not carry the sway of high nobility. They live in great luxury, and are supposed to conduct very important business within the city. However many only partake in the former.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Servants           | Social Class     | Those who come from [[Elysium Station]] station to serve within the city. These are usually lowly positions such as personal servants, guards, cooks, cleaners, maintenance, shop keepers, and things of the like. Socially, the are expected to keep their heads down and not cause trouble. Controversial sociologists have compared their behaviors to that of slaves. This is understandable because slaves are not allowed within the city for security reasons, and they have taken up the next closes role. The vast majority of servants are required to leave the city and head to [[Elysium Station]] after their shift work is completed. |\n| Kingsguard         | Occupation/Guild | The military presence responsible for keeping law within the city. Members of this group exist on a spectrum which varies from devout elite (usually from [[The First Bastion]]), to lazy oaf who was lucky enough to be stationed in the capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| The Golden Council | Occupation       | Those responsible with counseling the king.

Crown of [[Laenwalde]]. He is charged with running the city and kingdom, with the help of his Golden Council. The king is able to choose his council, and none are allowed to deny the call of council. Members come and go, and are usually assigned by merit in the kings eyes, but some stations are usually filled by direct associate with some other position.\n\nThe Golden Council are as follows:\n- **King's Advisor** - Kings Advisor Edmond Vaultry, A wise old elf man.

Charged with maintaining all naval military.\n- **Council of Aeronaut** - Lady Gale Windstrom, an Aarakocran woman of many years of experience. Charged with maintaining all aeronautical military.\n- **Council of Coin** - High Lady Uraka Jirona, a halfling woman with a silver tongue and deep pockets of her own. Responsible for maintaining the crown's coin. Also ruler of [[Kahdinacht]].\n- **Council of Arcana** - Grandmaster Whiles Gennador, the famed Human Arcanist.

Charged with providing council in ongoings involving the viridescent. \n- **Council of Observance** - High Priest Tarsin Gennador, the head of the Zolaen Church within [[Laenwalde]]. An aged human man. Brother to Grandmaster Whiles Gennador.

Charged with maintaining relationships with foreign powers.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law                    | Severity | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Disallowment of Slaves | Medium   | Salves are not allowed within the city. Also individuals are not allowed to bring slaves within the city. Slaves are considered convicted criminals and a security threat to the capital. |\n| Illegal Entry          | High     | If one does not have the proper invitation or certification to enter the city and they manage to enter somehow, they can be met with serious charges.                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Heliodor]] is considered to be almost mythological by outside views. If it weren't for its fame, many would doubt its existence. It is a floating city, a marvel of technology and magic. It acts as the hub of all important ongoings within [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Heliodor]] is a very young city. It was constructed to replace the old capital, [[Audran]] which was destroyed by [[The Castle of Bodies]]. Its make resembles the appearance of the horrible void god in an effort to defy the destruction the kingdom once faced.\n\n## The Creation of Heliodor\nLong after [[Laenwalde]] had recovered from the [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack on [[Audran]], the kingdom was still without a clear capital.\n\nTo remedy this, the nobility came up with a frivolous design that [[Artificers]] of [[The University]] made into reality. A floating golden city, almost defiant of [[The Castle of Bodies]]. While having obvious issues, like alienation of lower classes in the capital, [[Heliodor]] does seem to offer a beacon of hope to the people of [[Zol]].\n\nBuilt outside of [[Ryze]], [[Heliodor]] is capable of both vertical and lateral movement at a slow pace. It has many failsafes in place ensuring that the city will land before it crashes. The city is small in comparison to its terrestrial cousins, but this is by design. Its primary function is a political headquarters for [[Laenwalde]].\n\n## Societal Effect of Separation from the Surface\nInitially the city served its function very well, however after many years some nobility have had their altitude cloud their judgment.

Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and named after the stark white [[Chalkstone]] it is built from. Known for its wine, art, music, medicine and of course its export of refined [[Chalkstone]]. Holocene is the richest city east of [[Mod Dranor]]. This was made possible due to the value of refined chalkstone in the practice of [[Alchemy]], and [[Iron Light]].\n\n![[holocene.png]]\n\nHolocene's resources are controlled by the [[Alderian Seat]] of the city, and the profits are shared amongst all its citizens within the walls. This makes for a wonderfully high quality of life, but gaining citizenship in Holocene is no simple feat.\n\nThe generosity stops at the city's breach. The city's [[Gate Town]], known as The Spring, is full of people who wanted to make a home within the city, but did not qualify. The produced culture is a tight-knit ghetto. The rivalry between the outer and inner city is a staple of Holocene.\n\nHolocene's east overlooks [[The Grand Nothing]], and houses the [[Pale Lift]] which is actively being constructed.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city has the longest standing economy in all of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. This has allowed for the creation of a beautiful city, rich with art and culture. All individuals who live within the city receive a universal income allowing them to undertake any career they choose. |\n| Main Challenge | They 'city' (by the definition of the nobility) is quite small, confined to its high walls built atop a plateau. All benefits the city provides stop at the walls. A massive [[Gate Town]] has been constructed around the base of the plateau where the lower classes of society live. These individuals, mainly made up of those who originally sought to gain citizenship in the inner city and their descendants, suffer at the greed of the inner city. Many want to leave, but the water from the city's spring is tainted with the minorly addictive [[Chalkstone]]. Making leaving quite difficult if you have drank it all your life. Despite the hard lifestyle of those who live in the [[Gate Town]], many live with the hope of one day moving into the inner city. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Imported farmed goods, hearty meat-and-potatoes meals, wild game, ales and mead |\n| Export | Art, [[Chalkstone]] |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| Some |\n| City Leader | Lord Leonell Vanveld |\n| Primary Language(s) | None |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Human |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Cliffside, Hilltop, Massive Gate Town |\n| Architecture | White Stone palaces, ramshackle slums |\n| Color(s) | White and Purple |\n| Symbolism | A tower with an arched top containing the rising sun |\n| Defenses | City garrison, sloped approach |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| High Nobility | Social Class | Those who control the city, and its finances. They are given this power and status due to political station or ownership of Chalkstone Mines |\n| Wall-Walkers | Social Class | Those who live within the city full time. They may have been born into it, or brought into it because of some merit. The name was given by those who live in the Gate Town, forced to watch the nobility walk the high walls in the distance. |\n| Peasantry | Social Class | Those who live in the slums of the Gate Town. Many work lowly jobs as miners or farmers. These individuals drink the unfiltered water from the city's spring. Causing a slow development of [[Chalkstone]] addiction. The substance has no effect in small doses, but one faces extreme withdrawal without it. |\n| [[Orella Bard College]] | Guild | The artists and entertainers of the inner city. These individuals pay handsomely (or have a patron pay for them) to enroll here, and train to be great in their craft. |\n| The Grey Council | Pseudo-Political Faction | A group run by well respected community members of the gate town. This group, while seen as illegitimate by [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], acts as a governing body for those who live outside the walls. Headed by Palona Greyfoot, a wise halfling woman. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n | --- | --- | --- |\n | The Pale Ward | Keep | The city's main keep and campus of beautiful buildings that house the high nobility. |\n | Spring Keep | Keep | A large mansion in The Spring that is headquarters to The Grey Council |\n | Holocene Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's primary teleportation circle |\n | Holocene Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | The Pale Lift | Misc. | A lift similar to [[Gilligan's Lift]], that is currently under construction |\n | The Chalkmarket | Market | The inner-city's main market |\n | The Grey Market | Market | The Spring's main market |\n | Cloudwater Inn | Tavern | A the most popular tavern in the spring, does not allow wall-walkers |\n | The Wooden Flute | Tavern | A tavern close to the city's main gate. Popular both to peasants and wall-walkers. This tavern is a hub of musical talents. Many come from far and wide to show their skills here. If they are well liked, an inner-city patron may bring them into the city to attend the Bard college. If they are well liked, they may have the chance to live there permanently. |\n | The Aradiir | Wine House | A wine house that is a common place for the wall-walkers to attend concerts put on by the bard college |\n | Scoreforged | Tavern | A tavern and dancing hall that implements many [[Apparatum]] illumination devices giving it a unique feel. The band that preforms there is a group of [[Warforged]] who play music all day and night without break. |\n | Orella Bard College | College | An educational institution focused on the arts: Visual, Architectural, Literary, Performance, and Culinary. Run by the Orella family of High Nobility. |\n | Kerketh Academy: Holocene Campus | College | A small campus located within the inner city. Attended by nobles, and largely conducts private tutelage. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is well protected by is massive garrison of soldiers. Under the ever watching gaze of Lord Leonell Vanveld, a clever and charismatic human man. The Lord's pockets are rumored to be bottomless. Many think Lord Leonell Vanveld is the richest person in all of [[Zol]].\n\nLong ago. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]], the city gave up their rule willingly to the rebels. At the time this seemed an act of grace, or possibly fear. In modern day, many believe it to be a long drawn out plan by the nobility to preserve the rule they have always had. Albeit modified to match the modern political climate.\n\nThe result is a cleverly planned out city that is very hard to access if you are not invited, or cannot afford it.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Inner City Membership | Low | One is not allowed within the city unless they have the proper documentation. This membership can be given temporarily if an individual pays a steep daily rate, or an inner city citizen fills out the proper documentation for a guest. Alternatively the city's high nobility may grant permanent citizenship. Infractions may result as fines, imprisonment, or temporary/permanent banishment |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the modern day, [[Holocene]] is seen as a city of exclusive art and culture. Its rules and restrictions are almost oppositional to the ideals of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Holocene]] was the first city to surrender during the [[Alderian Rebellion]], and the only one to do so willingly. In modern day this is seen as a clever ploy to maintain the city's aristocracy.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Urban legends of The Spring tell of secret passages into the inner city, but if they truly exist or not is only known by few.\n- Holocene is the only Non-Ward city to be hit by the [[Greatwinds]]. Fortunately, the [[Stormwall]]'s foothills, North Sea inlet, and [[The Grand Nothing]]'s combatting weather systems protect the city from the bulk of the winds.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.779233429Z","tags":null},"/Holyfield":{"title":"Holyfield","content":"![[Holyfield.jpg]]\n\nThe Sacred Land, The First Corner. [[Holyfield]] is a region held high in some teachings of [[Zol]]'s [[Religion]]s. In these teachings, it is thought to be the first place where [[The Watcher in The Door]] began creating the world. Academics will tell you there is no real evidence of this, however the region possesses strange, and unique natural tendencies. Those who go there will also tell you there is an undefinable, gripping emotion that is associated within being in this place. A haunted feeling of beauty, awe, fear, and reverence. Something deep within ones gut they tells them they are not worthy of this place. These strange natural tendencies are known as [[The Hum]], and are most present as a mysterious musical humming 1/3rd of people can hear.\n\n[[Holyfield]] is largely made up of a vast expanse of golden-green colored grass, broken up by occasional stone outcroppings. Despite its reverence, and high pedestal it is held in by some, there is not much variety to be seen within the region.\n\nThe properties of [[The Hum]] that exist beyond [[The Blades]] are as follows:\n- **Any damage done to the land**, be it cracked stone, cut plants, or moved dirt **slowly heals over time** similarly to a cut upon ones flesh. It may scar in an inexact way, but the land returns itself to a constant state.\n- **Any structure** built within the region **crumbles and rots within hours**.\n- **Plants do not grow or die**, they seem held in a constant balance.\n- Any natural **material taken from the region crumbles to dust in a matter of days**.\n- **There are no animals** that have been recorded in the area.\n- **Ocean waters** near [[Holyfield]] **are almost entirely still**.\n- The **weather is a constant here**. Medium winds and slightly cold temperatures blanket the land.\n- When approaching [[Holyfield]], one will witness the sun either rise or fall to rest so it is slightly below the horizon. Making it so **the land has a feeling of constant early dawn or late dusk**. A time referred to by painters as 'golden hour'.\n- All who traverse these lands experience **a constant haunted feeling of beauty, awe, fear, and reverence.**\n- Roughly **33% of individuals** who enter the region claim to occasionally **hear a musical humming sound**. This hum is quiet but has great enough kinetic energy behind it it can cause cymatic patterns in water. This is the most prevalent characteristic of [[The Hum]].\n- A brave **few make pilgrimages deep into the field and over 95% don't return**. Most of those that do return claim to have found nothing, but **a rare few return with broken minds and what is known as a 'Creature Gift'**. These gifts take the form corpses of horrible, asymmetric, mangled beasts of black fur, chitin, red eyes, sharp teeth, and distended jaws. Those who have seen them explain them to look somewhat like a dog. No one knows what they are or where they come from, but they are extremely sacred to The [[Church of The Hum]]. Academics have attempted to get their hands on one of these beings but The [[Church of The Hum]]'s members will lay down their lives to protect them.\n\nTwo religious groups have formed in the area. The [[Church of The Hum]] and [[The Speakless]]. The [[Church of The Hum]] are a reverent group who seek to experience and understand the power of the region and how it relates to [[The Trinity]]. [[The Speakless]] are a dangerous cult of silent and lethal warriors that attack any who they catch trying to venture deeper into [[Holyfield]]. Both parties are considered a manifestation of [[Obscuran]] belief.\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **Qalderaach** - A collection of large stone outcroppings. Thought to be where [[The Speakless]] originate from.\n- **The Few** - Five massive trees, no one knows their origin or significance.\n- **The Blackbeach Coast** - The western coast of black sand beaches.\n- **The Beachless Cliffs** - The eastern coast, no beaches exist here. Merely cliffs that vary between heights hundreds or even thousands of feet above sea level. It has been determined that the lack of beaches is a product of [[The Hum]]. Any erosion of the cliffs repairing itself after being removed. Any sand produced by the erosion dissipates into nothingness.\n- **Inera** - A forest of trees that exists mostly outside of the effects of [[The Hum]]. However there are times where the effect of [[The Hum]] temporarily expands its influence upon Inera, causing for a very peculiar ecosystem. The beasts and monsters found here are described as angelic and terrifying.\n- **[[Church of The Hum]]** - A massive campus with a cathedral at its center. This sect is tied to the ideals of Trinity-Centric [[Religion]], with a focus on [[The Hum]]'s presence within [[Zol]]. These individuals are know to be extremist in their views, and are very strange to outsiders.\n- **The Cymatic Lakes** - 2 grand lakes who's surfaces occasionally vibrate with the cymatic patterns of [[The Hum]].\n\n## Climate\nDue to the effect of [[The Hum]], the area is in a constant state similar to that of a late temperate spring.\n\n## History and  Inhabitants\n[[Holyfield]] was explored in the early first age by the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]]. However it was first discovered by the [[Changelings]] of [[The Glassius Reach]], who view the land as forbidden. It took much time for the clergy of [[Zol]] to discover religious significance within the area. When the idea of it being the worlds place of origin came to light, many thought to build a city within the sacred land. However due to the effect of [[The Hum]] this was impossible, and even if there was a method of maintaining a structure within the region there are no resource to support a large society.\n\nSmaller groups then moved to build something at its edge, The [[Church of The Hum]] was founded from this mission. During the early days of the new church, its members discovered another group that had seemingly been there long before. A sect of frightening and mute warriors masked in rags who were named [[The Speakless]].\n\n[[The Speakless]] acted as sentinels of [[Holyfield]], attempting to stop anyone who ventured deep into the realm. However [[Holyfield]] is quite large, and [[The Speakless]] are few. Without horses or proper fortifications, pilgrims from the [[Church of The Hum]] are able to sneak past them successfully. However those that are not are swiftly dispatched.\n\n## Borders\nThe region borders the kingdoms:\n- [[Gethsemane]] by way of the [[Wrath Wastes]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.782233444Z","tags":null},"/Hoss":{"title":"Hoss","content":"*The Dragon Glass City*\n![[Hoss Skyline 2.png]]\n\nShrouded in mist and ice, [[Hoss]] is a city isolated both geographically, and politically. Known as the traitors of [[The North Honor]], [[Hoss]] is infamous for its rivalry with [[Often]] and [[Fike]] as well its questionable practices of draconic enslavement. This practice was adopted during [[The Dragon War]] as a means of turning lesser dragons back against their more powerful enemies. It is an extremely difficult thing to manipulate a dragon in this way, even ones that are of lower cognitive ability. However, a group who called themselves [[Dragonstalkers]] were determined in the art of draconic manipulation. They spent every hour of their waking lives during the later years of [[The Dragon War]] focused on the domestication of lesser [[Dragons]]. It is a demanding profession, both physically and mentally. However it was instrumental in claiming victory for [[The Ward]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Additionally, this feat of mortals would not have been possible without the help of The mages from [[The College of Hoss]].\n\nThe city's parasitic relationship with [[Dragons]] is visible even in its structures. The whole city is covered in Dragon Glass. An obsidian slag made by blasting sand with Dragon Fire. This protects the city well from both siege and storm.\n\n![[hoss.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Main Opportunity         | The city is cut away from the rest of the world, both politically and geographically.

|\n| Nobility                         | Social Class     | The upper crust of the city's society. Not as refined as foreign nobility, but obviously more well off than the rest of society. Comprised of the Grand Archon, their supporting council, successful business owners, merchants, and families of long standing wealth. This small group is known for being allowed to do almost anything they want as long as the Grand Archon allows it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Commoners                        | Social Class     | The general populace. Known as a pragmatic and unpretentious people. They are shipwrights, soldiers, smiths, shop keeps, and many other things of the like. The community that exists amongst them is very close, however they are extremely distrusting of outsiders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Peasantry                        | Social Class     | Those of lesser means. Farmers, builders, dockworkers, [[Stormdew]] gatherers, and people of the like. They live difficult, hungry lives jam packed into small homes. A great deal struggle to the point of homelessness, some even falling on such hard times they are eventually swept away by the [[Greatwinds]] as they have no where to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| [[Dragonstalkers]]               | Mercenary/Guild  | Warriors who dedicate themselves to the practice of draconic enslavement. This profession is extremely difficult and dangerous, with a very high mortality rate. These individuals will hatch, raise, or capture lesser dragons. This practice is done both by an organized group or by independent individuals. The former is known as [[The Arendari]], a group allied with [[The College of Hoss]] that is known for their service to the Grand Archon. Some [[Dragonstalkers]] are also rumored to practice dark rituals, like replacing one's own blood with that of a dragon. Some [[Dragonstalkers]] will ride their dragon, while others use it more like an attack dog. Originally the only relationship between dragon and dragonstalker was exclusively an abusive one, but now there are some who have close relationships with hatched dragons. Similar to that of a horse and its rider.   |\n| Mages of [[The College of Hoss]] | Academic station | [[The College of Hoss]] is a small institution at the edge of the world. On paper they present themselves as a prestigious place of study, focused simply on the understanding of [[Zol]]. However their reputation in history and rumor is much different. They have been known to push the boundaries of magical practice, pursing dark power. Lower ranking members of the institution present themselves similar to staff and student of other academic institutions like [[Kerketh Academy]], but it gets harder and harder to ignore the mysterious nature of the higher ranking members of the college. Many claim they seek the dark sides of necromancy, experiment with the blood of dragons, and commune with eldritch beings. It also does not help their reputation that they are considered to be sister schools with [[The Kybis Assembly]] in distant [[Kapesh]]. |\n| [[Stormblessed]]                 | Misc.            | Individuals who prove themselves to be the most worthy during [[The Enduring]], and are blessed with power by [[Adrathar]]. These individuals receive the utmost respect from their community.

It is known for making trouble with its rivals [[Often]] and [[Fike]], and many love to tell tales about [[Dragonstalkers]]. However its most relevant impact would be that of [[The College of Hoss]], and its relationship with [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Hoss]] is known as a traitorous city by most. It played an instrumental role in [[The Dragon War]] and defending [[The North Honor]], but eventually it tried to claim itself as the capital, and its ruler the Grand Archon. This started its evolution into what it is today.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Sometimes young and ambitious minds from [[Often]] and [[Fike]] will abandon their cities, and try and find a place for themselves at [[The College of Hoss]].\n- Much of The Church of The Winds theology revolves around the idea of honor. Most outsiders view the majority of the city's practices as dishonorable, but many from [[Hoss]] justify it as an honorable display of strength.\n- Grand Archon Dallance Fjall uses the title 'Grand' to denote his superiority over the other Archons of [[The Ward]]. However the other kingdoms do not respect this title for the same reason the conflict between the three cities continues. The fact that the Archon of [[Hoss]] has always called themselves the 'Grand Archon' since the breaking of [[The North Honor]] is an item of much debate. Some are loyal to the titles, others think it a joke.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.794233505Z","tags":null},"/House-Doucaar":{"title":"House Doucaar","content":"See [[Kahdinacht]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.794233505Z","tags":null},"/House-Tretch":{"title":"House Tretch","content":"See [[Kahdinacht]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.794233505Z","tags":null},"/Humans":{"title":"Humans","content":"*The Adaptable, Ambitious, and Assiduous.

They invaded [[Zol]] from [[The Space Outside Reality]] during the [[First Age]]. Their home world is a poorly understood, and abstract place that [[Illithids]] captured and interrogated during [[The Illithid Invasion]] spoke of. Their species seems to have a hybrid of individual and hive consciousness. Most records tend towards the latter, where a large group of [[Illithids]] share their forms with a more powerful being called an Elder Brain. Little is know about Elder Brains, but they manifest as massive brains with tentacle like protrusions that span huge distances like a slime mold. However, an Illithid seems to have the capacity to break free of an Elder Brain with a great deal of effort. This gives them an agency of their own, but so little is understood about them this may only be one facet to the complex species.\n\nThey reproduce parasitically, [[Illithids]] produce tadpoles which can enter a host, and take over their body. This process takes time, but when it is complete the host will be 100% Illithid in their biology. This change also effects them cognitively, and most seem like completely different people. The minds of a host are very pliable at the time of this change. It is usually at this time an Elder Brain will take over the mind, and bring it into the hive. Each changed Illithid will have their own unique appearance which slightly reflects that of the host.\n\nThe beings are fascinated with magic, and knowledge. They even seem to be able to feed off of Cognitive [[Energy]], however they can partake in normal food as well. The purpose of their invasion is not well understood by academics, but it is largely considered that they came to [[Zol]] in search of something. However, they poorly underestimated the people of [[Zol]] and were defeated. When the survivors fled, they left a few of their species behind. Now [[Illithids]] lurk in the dark corners of [[Zol]], barely reproducing enough to keep their species alive. Some conduct horrors to strange, unknown purposes. Others merely attempt to hide, and lead a normal life in disguise. They are so few in number that most forget the possibility of even encountering one.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | Unknown |\n| Height | Varies based on host, but the conversion to Illithid usually adds a foot or two. |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- [[Illithids]] are usually extremely intelligent, regardless of their host's past.

Magical feats accomplished without the usage of Iron light. They are more powerful, valuable, and harder to utilize. Their name comes from their elusive, mysterious and permanent nature. It is often simplified to \"Imbuement\" by the public.\n\nEncapsulating how any [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] is utilized is nearly impossible as there does not seem to be any sort of limit of methods. Some techniques are:\n- Magesmithing - A practice involving the use of magical metals and expert smithing to produce magical tools and weapons. This has a very wide cultural significance in the stories of [[Zol]], specifically amongst [[Dwarves]].\n- Grand [[Alchemy]] - A practice involving the use of rare substances combined in very specific ways to produce reality bending chemicals and materials\n- Meridian Craftsmanship - A practice similar to Magical Blacksmithing that spans a wider range of techniques. A craftsperson who utilizes great skills along with rare magical materials. This could be leather work, fletching, luthiery, or even sewing.\n- Grand [[Arcana]] - The utilization of [[Arcana]] to create, highly complex, specialized spells to modify mundane objects to make them permanently magical. This is bar none one of the most difficult skills one can obtain. To implement it, one must be able to utilize [[Iszertion]] and understand its complex nuances.\n- Ascendance - Accomplished by leveraging the will of [[Observance]] or [[Viridescence]]. The practice of calling upon a higher power to make a mundane object more powerful. This can be done through prayer, sacrifice, ritual, or trade with this greater power. In most cases this is done with the power of [[Observance]], but there are records of some individuals utilizing the power of nature itself for this effect.\n\nFor a mortal to harness grand forces, it involves understanding the complexities of the [[Magic]] being used, as well as the material you are trying to make the magic permanent within. It is exceedingly difficult to put magic permanently into something that is not magical. To overcome this barrier, most techniques utilize materials that are already magic. The outliers being Grand [[Arcana]] and Ascendance. These creations take serious time and effort. However sometimes spectacular anomalies can suddenly infuse an object with magic without an individuals intervention.\n\n## Perpetuum\nMany uses of magic can cause an object to become temporarily emboldened by magic. This is done by altering the [[Nodes]] that make up an object and, for lack of a better term, *convincing* them posses properties that they do not naturally posses. However, [[Nodes]] are known for being quite stubborn. One can convince a node that it is has new prominent properties while quieting its others for a time, but nodes have a sort of memory of their natural state. They will always entropically tend back to this state, unless this memory is removed.\n\n[[Artificers]] will overcome this hurdle in one of two ways:\n- **Circumvention** - by utilizing materials that are already magical, one can be sure the end product will be magical. However it becomes an issue of magical in what way. One cannot simply make a dagger out of [[Mythril]] and expect it to be able to pierce the hide of great [[Dragons]]. It takes great craftsmanship and dedication to be able to make an object with the desired properties. The more skilled the craftsman, the more accurately they can approximate the desired effect. The crafts that use Circumvention are:\n\t- Magical Blacksmithing\n\t- Grand Alchemy\n\t- Peak Craftsmanship\n- **Annulation** - the act of removing the memory held within [[Nodes]] and assigning them new properties simultaneously. This allows [[Artificers]] to utilize any material, even mundane, to create powerful objects with exact properties. This is extremely difficult to achieve and highly dangerous. The memory removal of [[Nodes]] needs to be fully comprehensive as if anything remains the [[Enchantment]] won't be permanent, or may fail outright. Then the infusing with new memory needs to not only include the new properties, but aspects of the original object, lest the object become unstable. A unstable object may cease to exist, or become something unexpected and dangerous. On top of this, these modifications need to happen simultaneously. If any of these steps fail the result could be catastrophic. When not aided by greater powers, complex objects require these Annulations to happen in stages, each feature being added one after the other. The crafts that use Annulation are:\n\t- Grand Arcana\n\t\t- The most notable form of [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] as it is the only method where what is created can be exactly what the craftsman seeks, assuming production is successful.\n\t- Ascendance\n\t\t- Ascendance is very rare and is not know to include the same dangers and complexities as Grand Arcana. This is because the actual Annulation is being performed by a much more powerful being than even a highly skilled [[Artificers]].\n\t\t- The greater being may not create the object to the requester's specifications as they may impose their own will.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.79923353Z","tags":null},"/Imperfect-Representation":{"title":"Imperfect Representation","content":"See [[Iron Light]] and [[Materiation]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.79923353Z","tags":null},"/Incana":{"title":"Incana","content":"[[Incana]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

Zol is never without strife, beauty, hardship, innovation, danger, majesty, mystery, and adventure.\n\nA world thought to have once been ruled by [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Humans]]. These races, called [[The Triumvirate]], used the power of [[The Trinity]] to create an advanced and prosperous society. A civilization of sprawling cities of life, art, and culture. Sadly, this advanced society was completely destroyed in [[The Undoing]].\n\nNot much is known of [[The Undoing]], or what caused it. Ancient texts tell stories of a heinous act made by the [[Humans]]. It is thought to have been a scheme that would turn mortals so far from the light, the [[Zolaen Gods]] punished all of Zol for the crime. Others believe it was caused by [[The Wandering Gods]], a divine alien force that made themselves known to mortals only a century after [[The Undoing]].\n\nSince it is not known which gods or forces in [[Zol]] enacted [[The Undoing]], many theories try to explain the event, or cast blame on specific gods. Said blame has caused a history's worth of debate, discrimination, and war.\n\nRegardless of which force caused it, [[The Undoing]] obliterated uncountable tracts of land, reducing them to a strange, low altitude wasteland called [[The Grand Nothing]]. [[The Undoing]] banished all beings from where [[Old Zol]] once stood to the furthest intact corners of of the world, and stripped away all of their memories. This forced them to begin anew with no knowledge of the old world. Priests have begged the [[Gods]] to explain [[The Undoing]], but they refuse any question asked to them regarding the event.\n\nSome believe the final punishment of the humans was to have their [[Great Magic]] stripped from them, and fractured. From this revoked magic, some believe the gods created a cast of new races to bear the burden of humanity's sin. These would known as the [[Off-Human]] races.\n\nIn their new home, the sapient world began to atone, rebuild, relearn what was lost. Ages passed for [[Zol]]. What was once a society of refugees now resembled a civilization, but with only a fraction of its former glory. In these times, only the strong and powerful had agency, as the untamed wilds of Zol were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out. This hardship lasted millennia, but it all changed when the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.\n\nThe powerful mage [[Maalvern]] devised a way for the common folk to capture and utilize the [[Magic]] of [[The Trinity]], without the need of great skill, gifts, or blessings. Complex diagrams and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs allowed for simple magical devices called [[Apparatum]] that changed Zol forever.\n\nCommunication devices, agricultural advances, medical wonders, and many other wonderful things were created using [[Iron Light]]. Most notably, [[The Iron Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and largely unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were finally given agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since [[The Undoing]].\n\nNow [[Zol]] sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity. A realm said to be formed within the corpse of an infinite being within [[Zolaen Scripture]]. A developing world wrought with natural mystery, lost history, and unclaimed power. A world where anyone can claim their own destiny.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.79923353Z","tags":null},"/Iron-Light":{"title":"Iron Light","content":"Iron Light is a unique and efficient methodology used to simplify the usage of [[Arcana]] in the application of [[Enchantment]]. Named after the tell tale violet glow the application gives off, [[Iron Light]] was discovered by the great Arcanist and Academic, [[Maalvern]]. Its conception was what began the [[Second Age]].\n\n![[Iron Light Artificing.png]]\n\n*An artificer carving complex Ferric Alphabet runes into an iron slab, its design hidden amongst artistic additions to obfuscate its method of function. A process known as [[Ferrication]]*\n\n[[Iron Light]] revolutionized [[Zol]] by putting power in the hands of many who would be otherwise be at the whim of the world. Unfortunately, the technique has also introduced new dangers like new weapons of war, and the [[Magic]] ailment known as [[Materiation]].\n\nIn its most simple form, [[Iron Light]] devices (also known as [[Apparatum]]) are created via engraving special runes from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] into plates of Iron. This engraving is often called [[Ferrication]]. These symbols channel [[Arcana]] similarly to how one uses their [[Vizir]], with the main difference being the user does not need to know the techniques required to harness [[Magic]]. They can achieve the very specific result allowed by the runes by lending their [[Vizir]] to it.\n\n## Examples of Apparatum\nSome devices made with [[Iron Light]] are quite simple. Blades that dull very slowly, stoves that heat without fire, lamps that glow without fuel, or even simple refrigeration.\n\nOthers are quite complex and powerful. Allowing for things like usage at range, multi-device cooperation, prosthesis, and mathematical estimation. Examples of this are long distance communication devices, flying machines, [[Warforged]], [[Automail]], weather and navigational systems, and even the [[Trains]] of [[The Iron Tracks]].\n\n## Production and Economic/Societal Value of Apparatum\nThe difficulty in creation of [[Apparatum]] is proportional to skill, quality of materials, and complexity of the design. Some designs take hours, while other take days, months, and even years. Individuals who create [[Apparatum]] are known as [[Artificers]].\n\nSince it takes much training to complete even a simple [[Apparatum]], they are costly. Those of the lowest economic status would be lucky to own even a single [[Apparatum]], while those of common wealth will typically own one to three. For nobility, [[Apparatum]] are common place items. Their lavish homes are usually full of devices to increase their general quality of life.\n\nIn most civilized cities, there are common [[Apparatum]] that exist for use in business, or pubic benefit. These may be lamps that light the streets at night, or things like the [[Rift Smog]] filters in [[Tenzentak]]. Some civilizations have very particular views on [[Iron Light]]. The people of [[The Ward]] outlaw the usage of [[Apparatum]] based in spiritual belief.\n\n## Advancements in Iron Light\nIron light was originally limited to a small set of [[Ferric Alphabet]] runes, and slow production via iron engraving. Soon after the name was widely adopted, more symbols and compatible materials, and techniques were discovered.\n\nThe mediums to support Iron light spread to carpentry, glass working, alchemy, leathercraft, weaving, painting, smiting, and various others. Each with their own pros and cons. However some materials like obsidian and silver are inert. All mediums must be imbued with a great deal of pure iron to function. [[Apparatum]] created using materials other than pure iron are rare. All techniques require some iron to be present to work. Be it metal inlay, infused materials. Usually requiring special tools.\n\nA very popular and reliable technique was discovered for short term Iron Light solutions. A special material called [[Chalkstone]] was found to be very compatible with iron and allows for quick, and relatively accurate creation of [[Apparatum]] that last a small number of months. This is commonly used in novice work, prototyping, mass production, and education. Unfortunately devices made with chalkstone are easily destroyed by things like water damage, or other environmental hazards.\n\n## Oxidization\nOxidization is a huge problem for [[Iron Light]]. Iron, when exposed to the elements, begins to rust. Oxidization occurs 33% faster when the iron bears even a single rune from the [[Ferric Alphabet]]. To combat this, regular maintenance is required. Many [[Artificers]] pay their bills by upkeeping the [[Apparatum]] of their customers. If rust is allowed to develop for too long, it will permanently damage the runes.\n\n## Discovery\nThe Arcanist [[Maalvern]] discovered [[Iron Light]] at the end of the [[First Age]]. He observed common patterns in the damage created by [[Magical Backfire]]. By intentionally increasing the damage of [[Magical Backfire]], he was able to spot runes amongst the damage.\n\nOne of these runes was found to appear elsewhere. In [[Necromancy]], a phenomenon called a [[Death Scar]] matched exactly to [[Maalvern]]'s findings. This led to many other successive discoveries of similar nature. These found runes would later be called the [[Ferric Alphabet]].\n\nAfter much experimentation with the runes, their interaction with iron was discovered. A decade of experimentation led to a single working lamp, and a basic theory of [[Iron Light]].\n\nLittle is known about why [[Iron Light]] actually works. It is widely accepted that there lies something within the properties of iron that mimics a living body, allowing it to share the powers of one's [[Vizir]].\n\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is assumed to be some product of [[The First Tongue]]. Since there is very little known about the origin of both subjects, the practice largely operates on assumption in this area.\n\n## The Ferric Alphabet\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is a wide set of runes that represent the aspect of [[Zol]] like [[Space, Matter, and Energy]] as well as the complex relationships between them. These runes can be organized in an infinite amount of configurations to accomplish [[Enchantment]].\n\nThe alphabet is thought to be incomplete, and many academics spend their lives searching for more runes. Missing runes are made up for by the combination of known runes, this is referred to as [[Imperfect Representation]]. For example, glass is represented with light and stone, along with a complex nexus of supporting runes to ensure the representation is stable. Nearly all [[Apparatum]] require the use of [[Imperfect Representation]], but the key to good artificery is mitigating the usage and complexity of [[Imperfect Representation]]. Too much imperfect representation within a given [[Apparatum]] causes an *electric* sensation during usage.\n\n## Negatives to Iron Light\n[[Iron Light]] is revolutionary due to how accessible it makes [[Magic]], but it is not nearly as powerful as [[Enchantment]] made from [[Imbuement Perpetuum]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] also demands the usage of one's [[Vizir]], and in turn can be very exhausting if overused. Long term usage of complex [[Apparatum]] causes a rare magical disease called [[Materiation]]. This is only seen when the Apparatum in question requires an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. \n\n[[Materiation]] causes the afflicted's body to slowly change to a different material state. It is most often seen amongst [[artificers]] and those who operate complex [[Apparatum]] as a part of their career.\n\nThis could manifest as holes in the body that slowly pour out smoke, appendages that become plantlike, or famously like the conductors of [[The Iron Tracks]] who turn to iron. Though gruesome, the condition is painless and described by the victims as euphoric.\n\n## Iron Light in relation to Imbuement Perpetuum\n[[Iron Light]] [[Enchantment]] is limited due to the fact it depends on the Vizir of an individual. Its more powerful counterpart, [[Imbuement Perpetuum]], is not limited in this way. Objects of this nature are much more rare and powerful.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.802233546Z","tags":null},"/Iszertion":{"title":"Iszertion","content":"The written form of [[The Old Tongue]]. It is an immensely complex form of writing and [[Enchantment]] that only [[Speakers]] can use and understand. Unlike its sister practice of [[Iron Light]] which uses logic and mathematics, [[Iszertion]] is more instinctual and difficult to explain to those who do not know [[The Old Tongue]]. It is best described as utilizing the same powers that speaking [[The Old Tongue]] gives, but rather than speaking, it is written down. It is also important to know that merely being able to speak [[The Old Tongue]] does not mean one can utilize [[Iszertion]]. It is a skill that must be learned. It is possible to use [[Iszertion]] with any of [[The Wills]], but it is almost always associated with [[Arcana]]. This is likely because the manifestations of [[Speakers]] who utilize the wills of [[Observance]] and [[Viridescence]] do not lean on their own creations as often as [[Arcanists]]. \n\nThe will that is being leveraged for [[Iszertion]] greatly changes the appearance of the characters and diagrams involved.\n- [[Arcana]] - Appears as very exact geometry and strange symbol with no discernable alphabet behind them, each character is unique to its specific purpose.\n- [[Viridescence]] - appears as flowing lines and intersecting round shapes\n- [[Observance]] - appears as a single, complex rune made up of many intersecting lines, curves, and shaded areas\n\n[[Iszertion]] can either directly change the properties of an object to accomplish magical feats. It can also be used to relay massive amounts of complex information as a form of writing.\n\nPerforming [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] using [[Iszertion]] takes a very long time, and is extremely dangerous. The chance of [[Magical Backfire]] is very great. It is often called Grand [[Arcana]], and it produces some of the most powerful magical objects. It is made much easier by utilizing magical components that already posses the properties one is seeking to imbue magically. A sword made with [[Iszertion]] will be much more successful if [[Mythril]] is used rather than mere steel.\n\n## Relation to the Ferric Alphabet\nMany have sought to form a connection between [[Iszertion]] and [[Iron Light]]. However there does not seem to be a correlation.\n\n## Implications for The First Tongue\nSince there is a written form of [[The Old Tongue]], many speculate that there is an equivalent for [[The First Tongue]]. However it is not known of if it even exists.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.805233561Z","tags":null},"/Jerdall":{"title":"Jerda'll","content":"*The City of Echoing Caves*\n![[Jerdall groundline 2.png]]\n\nDeep below the forest glades of [[Gethsemane]] lies the tall  cavern city of [[Jerda'll]]. Home to the [[Drow]], the city is a place of unique culture and unusual beauty. Its people hold traditions of deep legends and shared songs. Protected from outside influences by its giant iron gate, [[Jerda'll]] is truly a sight and sound to behold. Its people are known to sing and play old songs called [[The Acrylons]]. These pieces of music are said to aid them in their daily pursuits, share emotion, honor their dead, and protect their oldest stories from the withering effects of time.\n\n[[The Acrylons]] can almost always be heard within the city in some capacity. Blacksmiths singing songs of metal work, pedestrians humming tunes that denote their mood or journey's purpose, city guard chanting low simple songs of order. All of these songs meld and harmonize together when performed in proximity, as if they were part of some greater, singular composition. These melodies are taught to children parallel with things like language, and etiquette. [[The Acrylons]] give a sense of community, synchronicity, and connectedness to all people of the city. Their echoing through the caves fills the city with a sense of heartfelt warmth on good days, and a haunted feeling on darker ones.  It is said that a [[Drow]] far from home can touch a raw stone and hear the songs of their people.\n\n![[jerdall.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Main Opportunity         | Citizens of [[Jerda'll]] posses [[The Acrylons]], a unique form of musical communication that creates an interconnected society amongst the [[Drow]]. The city's people can react and respond to the song they hear around them. An uneducated eye may think the city moves like a machine, where each person fits into a functional box and their songs mesh together like the teeth of gears. The truth is more like the innerworkings of nature. There is an everchanging flow to the city, but you can see its truths if you know how to listen for it. Those who can comprehend it, can glean much from the city by ear alone. |\n| Main Challenge           | Residing underground can be an isolating way of life. However this is favorable to many [[Drow]]. So favored in fact, they keep their gates barred shut for to all outside parties. Guests are only allowed on official business, formal invitation, or the rare event. Outsiders are easy to spot in the city as they bear no songs. Most feel very out of place in the city.

Made up mostly of captured thieves and bandits, almost no slaves are from the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Mentors          | Career Level | Those who are very skilled within their profession.

These individuals spend the first centaury of their lives building skills to go on in their own pursuits. These individuals will have multiple mentors, each of which will train them in a different aspect of their career path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name                 | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Tikyri'ax            | Keep                 | The city's main keep                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The Maw              | Gate                 | The city's main gate to the surface.

She is known for being extremely wise and decisive. The Maer of [[Jerda'll]] is not known to move amongst the common people, and has a sort of mystery about her, even to the locals.\n\nShe and her army are a force to be reckoned with. Her army of fighters, specialized in close quarters combat due to their underground location.\n\n### Laws\nThe city enforces its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Murder                              | High        | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission.

To outsiders, it lives mostly in rumors and myths of the common folk, but more worldly individuals are still relatively unaware of the city's daily life.\n\nIt does however, act as one of [[The Three Corners]]' primary access point to [[The Underdark]], but it is almost exclusively used by the kingdom of [[Gethsemane]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nHistorically, the armies of [[Jerda'll]] have been a fearsome and intimidating force. Those who have gone to war with [[Gethsemane]] would typically face extended ranged battles. However if [[Gethsemane]] got the upper hand, and could get a dispatchment of foot soldiers beyond enemy reinforcements, those who saw the black armor of [[Jerda'll]] knew they stood on death's door.\n\nThe [[Elves]] of [[Jerda'll]] are trained to fight in little to no light, and in very narrow close quarters. This training proves very useful when invading a city. Fighting atop walls and in city alleyways is actually very akin to fighting in a cave. \n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The people of [[Jerda'll]] tell stories of beings who live deep within [[The Underdark]]. Some speak of a hidden city of great beast-like people, covered in brightly colored, and vibrantly patterned fur. Each and every one of them a unique shape and size. There are similar stories of insectoid cities, or nomadic tribes of fungal beings.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.808233576Z","tags":null},"/Jhenbridge":{"title":"Jhenbridge","content":"*Built atop the Ruins of Keptifer Academy, filled with ambitious minds and lost things*\n![[Jhenbridge.png]]\n\nLocated within [[Audran]], the school is an integral part of [[The University]]. [[Jhenbridge]] is an institution of the [[Arcanum]], and is famed for its accessible education. [[Jhenbridge]] is built atop the ruins of Keptifer Academy. Keptifer was a small, and private academic institution from before [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked the city, and reduced the school to rubble. It was not a very long standing school, and most saw it as a place for dangerous mages to interact out of the public's eyes. The loss of Keptifer Academy was a tragic thing for those in academic circles, however the deep bowels of Keptifer were largely left untouched. Clever academics built [[Jhenbridge]] atop these hidden treasures to protect and claim the mysterious resources deep under the city.\n\nThe school is largely comprised of beautiful stone buildings with large windows. Its campus covers a large portion of the inner city district of Charside, and it has many buildings, public squares, and gardens. Some of the buildings still bear the scars of [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack.\n\nThose who wish to learn here are allowed to do so for free in their first year. If they are successful, they may pursue a further education. Cost of tuition is based on a students promise. The better they can serve their school, the less expensive their fees. First year courses are also very low level, and they do not include the great dangers of magic. Based on this, much of the public sees the school as a pillar of the community, however skeptics think that they keep a horrible secret below the school. Students and staff have a great love for the campus. Since it is very accessible, there is a diverse group of economic classes who attend [[Jhenbridge]].\n\n## Admission\nJoining the school is quite simple. All that is required is a detailed entrance interview to determine if an individual is fit for academia. Over 90% of individuals are admitted. Upon admission, an individual can choose to take lodging and a meal token which. Both of which are very humble things. A small dorm (which is sometimes just a single bunk, small desk, and chest), as well as 2 meals per day at the dining hall which most students call *\"Bricks\"*. Many students who have the means choose to live and eat elsewhere.\n\nAfter their first year, students can apply for further education. If accepted, they will be told a billing fee based on their promise as an academic. Those who are more skilled receive lower tuitions. It is also an unofficial rule, that those of lesser means typically receive lower costs than nobles who the school can bleed for money. If a student is rejected, they can apply again for readmission the following year for a fee. They are tested by verbal examination, and if they do well they are given a tuition cost, otherwise they must try again next year.\n\n[[Jhenbridge]] is often mocked for the fact it has the lowest tuition costs to an academic institution which studies [[Arcana]]. However its education is just as valid as any other.\n\n## Leadership\nThe school is headed by The Broken Table. A council of esteemed Arcanists who have served the school for many years. There is no sole leader, but only ever 5 members to avoid ties in voting. They conduct their meetings at The Broken Table. A large stone table that was cracked during the attack on [[Audran]] by [[The Castle of Bodies]].\n\n## Members\n\n| Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| First Years | Students who are in their first, free year of education. A little under a tenth of these students will go on to higher education. Because of this, these students are largely mocked. |\n| Irons | Students who have passed their first year of education, or readmission exam, and have continued on. These students receive an iron pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Silvers | Students who have spent a few terms in Iron, and have proven themselves adept at [[Magic]]. These students receive a silver pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Golds | Students who have become [[Speakers]], or otherwise proved themselves extremely adept at [[Magic]]. These are few in number, and of the highest skill amongst students. These students receive a gold pinky-ring to mark their status. |\n| Arcanists | Those welcomed fully into the rank of master. These are individuals who have become the peers of their teachers, or even surpassed them. Some remain at the school to teach or study, others venture out into the world. They are given a ring of [[Mythril]], and sometimes the rings are set with various stones. It is not known publicly what the specific stones denote, but students claim that they show the unique successes of a given individual. |\n| Students | Those who receive an education. |\n| Professors | Those who wear bands of [[Mythril]], and teach students. |\n| Instructors | Promising students who wear bands of gold, and aid in the teaching of lower students. |\n| General Staff | Non academics who aid the schools day-to-day. |\n\n## Other information\n- The more prestigious sister school of [[The Brass Hall]] will occasionally head hunt more promising students from [[Jhenbridge]]. Because of this, there is a rivalry amongst the staff of both schools.\n- Very rarely a student or professor will transfer to [[Jhenbridge]]. In this case there is no examination given, and the offer to join the school usually comes with a ring.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.808233576Z","tags":null},"/Kahdinacht":{"title":"Kahdinacht","content":"*The City of Fine Things, Noble Houses, and Wine*\n![[Kahdinacht.png]]\n\n[[Kahdinacht]] has always been know for its beauty and refined culture.

Being the ruler of [[Kahdinacht]] comes with many gifts as the noble houses try and buy favor.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the current day, the city is known mostly for exporting fine drinks that are sent all over [[The Three Corners]] of Civilization. Those who view the city more closely see its over-saturation with important nobles of [[Laenwalde]]. They know it to be a place of naturalistic study, and wild artisans.\n\n## Historical Importance\nLocated within what was originally part of [[Gethsemane]], the region was a safe haven for a few tribes of peaceful [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] for a few hundred years, beginning around the year 3000. The safe haven was granted by the Wood [[Elves]] of [[Laelanor]], and was later given in full when the elves received aid from [[Gethsemane]] during the [[Western War]]. It was an act of kindness, but some believe the [[Elves]] never truly wanted any claim of it due to its latitude being largely equal to that of [[The East Mounts]]. When it was gifted, the tribes constructed the city of [[Kahdinacht]].\n\nFor many generations after the destruction of [[Audran]], [[Kahdinacht]] became the defacto capital of [[Laenwalde]]. It still sits high on a pedestal in [[Laenwalde]] culture because of this. \n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The region of Lakeside is misnamed semi-intentionally. Some less educated migrants would occasionally call the shore 'the lake' as the halfling word for lake and ocean sound similar. Nobility thought this was humorous and began to officially refer to that district as Lakeside. As the slum grew, the name stuck\n- Most noble families side with either House Doucaar or House Tretch in their long standing rivalry.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.809233581Z","tags":null},"/Kalamdola":{"title":"Kalamdola","content":"The home mountain of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Gethsemane]].

Known for its resilience, arcane knowledge, and deep seated religious culture. The Kingdom is under the reign of the [[Galliard Crown]], and most of its people follow the [[Church of Three Fires]]. Kapesh has fought many a battle against both of its neighboring kingdom, and faced the dangers of [[Zol]] more fully than most other places. It has stood the test of time and has the scars to prove it.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Archaic]] - The Oldest City\n- [[Viscera]] - The City that Never Sleeps\n- [[Stigmata]] - The City of Three Fires\n- [[Little Triumph]] - The Small City\n- [[Kierketholl]] - The Grand Capital\n- [[Riverbridge]] - The Island City\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nThe Wilds of [[Kapesh]] consist of strange expanses, and dangerous forests that spill over from [[The Witchlands]]. While unsafe, [[Kapesh]] contains natural beauties and wonders unlike that of any other region.\n\nDeep valleys holding winding rivers, flora and fauna that thrive in its mist covered wilds, and open landscapes marred by magical warfare that left hauntingly elegant scars.\n\nIts climate is largely temperate allowing for cultivation of many crops, so long as the farms can survive the lurking threats outside the city walls.\n\n## History\nKnown for its old ways, magic, and grit. Kapesh is ruled by [[King Galliard]] from its capital, [[Kierketholl]]. Kapesh is the oldest kingdom in Zol, as it was founded shortly after [[The Undoing]]. The [[Humans]] were scorned by the elves, dwarves, and gods. This made lives for the people of [[Kapesh]] more difficult at first, but quickly gave humans a reason to unify at a much faster rate than any other faction in all of [[Zol]]. [[Humans]] are known for their stubbornness and resilience in the face of resistance.\n\nKapesh's borders once included what is now the [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. When Kapesh first rose to power, all [[Off-Human]] races within its borders were heavily oppressed and many were forced to live as slaves. This was changed by The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. A civil war in which Kapesh lost its southern region to what is now known as The Free Cities of Alderun.\n\nThere is lots of superstition that regards humans as cursed, this belief is furthered by the problems that Kapesh has faced over the course of its existence. A kingdom located in a considerably inhospitable region filled with monsters, as well as a frankly volatile population. It has faced unique and isolated plagues and famine at various times through out its history. \n\nThey are also known for waging war in the past against [[Gethsemane]] multiple times. Known as The [[Triumvirate Battles]], the conflicts never amounted to much other than unnecessary deaths. The only territory that has ever changed hands in this exchange was Ile Sterza and the city of [[Riverbridge]].\n\nKapesh is home to many practitioners of [[Arcana]], most notably at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. Little fact is written on what exactly occurs there. On its surface it is a scholarly place of magic. The rumor mill however, spins stories of arcanists who tamper with the dark unknown forces of Zol.\n\n## Inhabitants\nKapesh is primarily inhabited by [[Humans]], but in modern day there are smatterings of diversity here and there. The most diverse city is ironically the capital [[Kierketholl]]. This is largely due to the fact anyone can slip away into the dense city to find a safe corner of their own to reside in.\n\nThose who live out in the wilds are either sturdy bandits, or natives to [[The Witchlands]] who care not for the borders of civilization.\n\nMonsters and thieves make straying from the roads of [[Kapesh]] dangerous for all who cannot hold their own.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom is ruled by the [[Galliard Crown]]. The [[Galliard Crown]] was brought to power when [[The Crown Titans]] were discovered. [[The Crown Titans]] are a strange, but powerful phenomena. They are a legion of 5 individuals who have been bestowed a power that allows them to assume a massive, and uniquely powerful forms. These powers are bestowed by a single individual called The Crux. No one knows what gives The Crux such power, but many attribute it to a divine source. It is understood that the powers that The Crux posses are passed down through bloodlines. Only one Gallan exists at a time.\n\nThe Galliard bloodline are the keepers of this power. When this was discovered, the Galliard bloodline was quickly married into noble families. Their power and cunning brought them to the status of the most powerful family in all of [[Kapesh]], and the rulers soon after.\n\nThe kingdom's economy favors only the wealthy. Many low born work hard days for little coin, while the nobility accumulate wealth. \n\nThese systems are upheld by the [[Kapeshian Laws]]. Which protects its citizens and bolsters the wealthy with social devices like slave labor.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\n[[Kapesh]] is not known for being particularly artistic itself, but it one of the largest consumers of imported arts. The art and culture that does exist largely consists of literature and religious art.\n\nThe culture of [[Kapesh]] revolves mostly around the concept of [[Religion]] (specifically the [[Church of Three Fires]]) and propaganda for the crown.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nThe kingdom's education and magic is almost exclusively associated with [[The Kybis Assembly]] and its archives. There is private tutelage that occurs on a small scale, and the occasional new institution that crops up here and there. If these new institutions gain any traction they are usually absorbed by the assembly, or dissolve after a short while.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe political climate of Kapesh is not considered a pleasant one, but it is very constant. There is bad history with both of its neighbors, and its people are fairly xenophobic. In modern day it has resolved to a sort of reluctant amicability, and commercial trade is conducted.\n\nWithin the kingdom itself, the lowborn are constantly doing everything they can to scrape by. The vast majority blame the crown but many are convinced it is the fault of outsiders. Regardless of the actual cause, most are completely without agency and forced to do whatever they can to get by while those favored by the crown live in luxury.\n\n## Military\nThe Kingdom has a very sizable military for its population. This is achieved through military propaganda and required service during times of war. [[Kapesh]] is not a kind kingdom, but is very effective. It has an average military in port at [[Riverbridge]]. Its troops are also supplemented by mages from [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n\n## Borders\n[[Kapesh]] borders the kingdoms of:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n\nIt also borders the wilds of:\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.813233602Z","tags":null},"/Kapeshian-Laws":{"title":"Kapeshian Laws","content":"This set of laws contains many of the main crimes that one could commit within [[Kapesh]].\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Murder | High | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission.

[[Kaszu]], also known as *Father Time* bears the moral of Sagacity. His teachings and followers surround the idea of protecting the sanctity of time itself. The manipulation of Time and Fate is a thing that attracts many Arcanists. This is a threat to the balance of all things, as time is the most volatile force know to [[Sapient Beings]]. [[Kaszu]] teaches the Moral of Sagacity, specifically with respect to Time, Fate, [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]].\n\n## Depiction\nDepicted as a man of large scale with dark greying hair. He bears ornate, purple robes and has a third eye on his forehead. His eyes are typically depicted as glowing, but on occasion he is shown as missing his left eye from its socket, and/or missing a finger on his left hand. Some depict him as having more human features while others depict him as being a very large gnome-like being.\n\n## Moral\n[[Kaszu]] teaches the moral of Sagacity. The skill of showing good judgment, wisdom, and foresight. This skill is beneficial in all aspects of life, but in the scripture of [[Kaszu]] it specifically focuses on these ideas in terms of tampering with Fate and Time.\n\n[[Magic]] is a very dangerous thing, and it allows for individuals to interface and tamper with both Fate and Time. This tampering can have some of the most grave consequences, and have the capacity to effect much more than just the individual(s) who initiated it.\n\nBy the ideals of [[The Wandering Gods]], [[Gods]] cannot limit the actions of mortals unable to resist the will of a God. [[Kaszu]] allows for the usage of [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]], so long as they are done with sagacity and wisdom. Thinking ahead on all things is in the core of making wise decisions.  \n\n## Associations\n[[Kaszu]] is associated with:\n- Academics\n- [[Chronomancy]]\n- [[Incana]]\n- Fate\n- Time\n\n## Realm\nWithin [[The Unknown Realm]], [[Kaszu]]'s domain is a very tall wizards tower. There is much speculation on what marvels line its halls, as little is written about it in scripture.\n\n## Behavior\n[[Kaszu]] is said to present himself like an old gentle teacher to his followers. Giving hints of advice when a learning opportunity arises, or when mistakes are made and the chance for improvement makes its head.\n\nControversially, there are some stories of [[Kaszu]] acting like a legal judge for those who have done heinous acts, abusing the powers of [[Arcana]] and [[Incana]]. Within a grand judgement room he decides a punishment for these perpetrators. However these are mostly considered to be mere stories. \n\n## Worshipers\nMost who follow [[Kaszu]] do not do so in a reverential way as many religions do. The majority are actually academics who research [[Incana]] and [[Chronomancy]]. They look to his teachings for guidance and wisdom, as these forces are remarkably dangerous. His followers are know to protect [[Zol]] against the dangers these forces pose, implementing policy and enacting punishment against those who carelessly pursue the manipulation of the past and future.\n\nIt is worth noting that only about 3/4's of academics in these specific fields follow the guidance of [[Kaszu]]'s teachings. And less than 1/4 consider themselves to be even light followers of his religion. The rest chase after the powers of Fate and Time on their own moral compass alone.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.814233607Z","tags":null},"/Kathoor":{"title":"Ka'thoor","content":"*Trade, culture, pride, and humility*\n![[kathoor skyline.png]]\n\nKa'thoor, the Orcish City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and known for its eclectic citizens, spicy food, dominant population of [[Orcs]], and unique architecture that incorporates the bones of large beasts. Ka'thoor rests on the border of [[Kapesh]], and is nestled into the mountains. It is a common stop for any who leave or enter [[The Free Cities of Alderun]].\n\n![[kathoor.png]]\n\nKa'thoor was once a hub of slave trade during the [[First Age]], and was the first of the now free cities to begin the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. In its victory, Ka'thoor has created a proud, but largely welcoming culture. They keep their history in everything they do to remain a beacon to all of [[Zol]].\n\nKa'thoor is now a hub of trade related to rare foods, materials, collectables, and art. This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor. As well as [[Kapesh]] merchants who seek the rare goods sold within the city.\n\nDue to its oppressive history, the city does not have nobility. Its leaders are required to live humble lives. In fact many of the people of the city do what they can to maintain humility. This is spawned from a complex culture which emerged shortly after The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Being at the heart of the rebellion, and directly on the border of their enemy, the city faced a great deal of chaos. Many upheld the ideals of never being forced to serve again, but the suddenly changed culture sent the city in to disarray. To remedy this, many people began an effort to serve the city in an attempt to rebuild it anew. Some saw their actions as weak, claiming they tended towards their past history of forced labor. Others saw the path as a righteous one. The two polarized views could not seem to find a common ground, and their differing beliefs only cemented themselves deeper. Over time, this formed two distinct groups. One of which was rooted in a proud and individualistic view of Orcish culture, the other was rooted in a sense of community. The latter became the most widely adopted.\n\nOne of the ways this is expressed is by doing favors for one another. Many members of the city's population wear unique earrings, called [[D'Nairae]], that advertise favors and skills they wish to offer to those in need. These may indicate a wish to give food, housing, repair, and even academic or religious teachings. These earrings have become almost a symbol of status, where one is seen as more high standing the wider the variety of earrings they wear. It has gone to the point where this is almost a problem that serves the opposite of what it is trying to achieve, as some wear a ridiculous amount of earrings to appear greatly (and falsely) humble for the status.\n\nAlong side those who bear [[D'Nairae]], there is an almost opposite group of those who are very proud. These individuals focus on strength, merit, and honor. This section of the populace refer to themselves as Bloodkeepers. Their maxim is one of combat and honor. The prideful Bloodkeepers see themselves as those who preserve the fury and strength that began the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. \n\nThese two groups live unharmoniously. Bloodkeepers see the humble members of society as weak, and that they uphold a modern version of the oppression the people once faced. The humble citizens see the Bloodkeepers as barbaric, arrogant, and uncivilized.\n\n## Humility vs Pride: The Ka'thoorin Discourse\nWithin Ka'thoor, about half the local population finds themselves on a spectrum of beliefs that spawn from the city's difficult past involving slavery and rebellion.\n\nOn one end of this spectrum exist the Bloodkeepers. These individuals are proud warriors who seek to honor those who fought for their freedom during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. These individuals are know to be loud and proud. They train to be fearsome fighters and seek to *preserve* the fury of their ancestors. Many of these individuals are skilled and honorable warriors wo do well in the upholding of their peoples fighting spirit. Unfortunately others are violent brutes who see it as 'their turn' to be in power. This group is seen as heroes from some perspectives, and bullies from others.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum exists an unorganized group of people who follow a unique philosophy and social practice. These individuals are extremely giving and humble. They bear simple colored earrings called [[D'Nairae]]. These earrings illustrate services and skills these people giving willingly to any in need. Some mistake this practice as being maintained in defiance to the masters of their ancestors. In reality, the practice is done for the sake of wisdom, kindness in community. When the people of the city were enslaved, their masters did nothing but take and consume. In modern day the people of Ka'thoor are free. Rather than taking things for themselves, some individuals seek to give instead to help ensure the city never ventures down that path again. \n\nThis group has no formal name, but Bloodkeepers refer to them as Bloodless. Some members of this group act as pillars of the community, giving and teaching to any who need it. Other members of this group either give to much and have to barely scrap by. Alternatively, some wear the [[D'Nairae]] falsely for the selfless image and status they give amongst some groups. While many look at these individuals as honorable and kind, some see them as preserving the forced servitude the city once faced.\n\nThese groups are not entirely distinct from one another, there are citizens who exist all over this spectrum. There are even some Bloodkeepers who bear [[D'Nairae]]. However, most who exist on this spectrum are closer to the extremes. There is no *major* conflict between these groups, largely due to the passive nature of those who bear [[D'Nairae]], but a tension is obvious at times.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city provides a very unique hub of trade, and an even more unique culture. Many people of Ka'thoor give so willingly that you can probably find any good or service one might need in the city. Alternatively a legion of brave and proud warriors called Bloodkeepers protect the city, and commonly engage in contests of strength and skill within The Kala'dola, the famous colosseum. |\n| Main Challenge | The city's people has 2 very different subgroups within. One of which is overly humble, the other overly aggressive. These two groups live unharmoniously. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Spicy foods, wild game, dried fruits, fermented foods |\n| Export | Trade Hub, textiles, hides/furs, rare goods |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| Few |\n| City Leader | Elder Err'del Raeshik |\n| Primary Language(s) | Orcish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Orcs |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Border-City, Foothill Location, Chaotic, Cramped |\n| Architecture | Large stone and wood buildings, vibrant tents and tapestries, structures accented with large beast bones |\n| Color(s) | Red, Black, Light-Red |\n| Symbolism | A chain with 5 links, the center one being broken |\n| Defenses | Bloodkeeper Warriors, Defensible location, Informal alliance with [[Beastfolk]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| City Elders | Leaders | Those who are chosen by the city's people to lead them. None of which are allowed to live lavishly. Most of these individuals bear [[D'Nairae]] |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The normal individuals of the city. These people live common lives and decidedly do not engage in the antics of [[D'Nairae]] or Bloodkeepers. They make up about half the population. A small portion of this group is made up of individuals who can't identify as nobility due to the city's culture, but it is known by most that some are much more well off than others. |\n| The Humble | Social Class | Those who bear [[D'Nairae]]. |\n| Bloodkeepers | Social Class | A warrior class of citizens who seek to preserve their city's pride and honor its history. |\n| Merchants | Economic Group | Merchants from all over [[Zol]]. Many come to trade in the great market of [[Ka'thoor]]. Primarily made up of Alderian and Kapesh merchants. |\n| Beastfolk | Economic Group | Traders who live in [[The Witchlands]] and venture down into the city to trade. They bear unique and rare goods, but have an almost alien air to them compared to common folk. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | The Fortress | Keep | The city's main keep. Does not act as a home for the city's leadership, merely a place of meeting. |\n | Ka'thoor Station | Train Station | They city's train station |\n | Ka'thoor Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle. Located within the Fortress|\n | The Kala'dola | Colosseum | The city's fighting arena, and main meeting place for Bloodkeepers. Many people come here for the almost daily fights. Contains a popular tavern for fighters. |\n | Trade Town | Market District | One of the largest markets in all of [[Zol]]. Full of merchants from [[Kapesh]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]]. Shops open and close in this fast moving bazaar. Many say that if it can be bought it is sold in Ka'thoor's trade town. |\n | The Bone Stack | Tavern | A tavern constructed from cobbled bones of great beasts and fallen warriors. Popular with Bloodkeepers who have distinct anti-human political views. |\n | The Crossroads Inn | Tavern | A tavern located on the edge of Aud at the crossroads of Alderun, The Witchlands, and Kapesh. It is a common waypoint for travelers entering or leaving Alderun, and beastfolk coming to Ka'thoor to trade. The result of this is a tavern where strange, fun, scary, arcane, uncanny, dangerous, disgusting, and beautiful events occur on the daily. There is a sign above the door that reads in orcish \"You are not an adventurer 'till you've spent the night at The Crossroads Inn\". Its gruff, confident, no-nonsense-but-somehow-fun-loving tavern keep, Lep Ka'tesh is an old orcish man that can tell the stories of Zol to a level of detail that rivals that of historians. Literally. A travelling scholar named Ulen Myf from The Kybis Assembly wrote a dissertation titled Tales of the Crossroads in which she retold the stories of Lep Ka'Tesh. They contradicted many historical writings of living scholars. It grew to great popularity out of novelty. The text's new found fame brought the book into the spotlight, so he was invited to The Kybis Grounds for a formal discussion on the topic. The event was later called \"The upturning of Crease Hall\", to this day no victor in the debates was decided, and Lep Ka'tesh is no longer allowed on Kybis grounds. The text holds a special place in the hearts of many scholars because of the event. The copy which was hurled at Lep Katesh by Master Kimmian Vowheart is valued greately, and sits framed above the bar at The Crossroads inn. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by the [[Alderian Seat]] Elder Err'del Raeshik, a wise old orc bearing many [[D'Nairae]]. The Elder's of [[Ka'thoor]] are nominated by the community. These individuals are required to live humble lives, and are removed from the position if they are caught accepting any bribe or misusing their authority. \n\nThe garrison is overseen by Bloodkeeper Met'ish Blak. A weathered veteran orc who only takes orders directly from the [[Alderian Seat]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Abuse of Power | High | If a city's elder is caught abusing their power in any way, they are removed from the position. |\n| Refusal of Request | High | Those sporting [[D'Nairae]] reserve the right to refuse the provision of a service their [[D'Nairae]] signify. This is beacuse they are an individual before a giver. |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Ka'thoor]] is a strange border town filled with hospitality, and undeniable tension. Some of which is  between its humble and proud locals, even more of which between its off-human locals and human visitors.\n\n[[Ka'thoor]] is a crucial hub of trade in [[Kapesh]] and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]'s economy. It also acts as a very important resource for those who live within [[The Witchlands]], as it is a place they can venture to for supplies.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city was the origin of the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. To this day it remains a defiant beacon of hope for all who have faced enslavement.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.815233612Z","tags":null},"/Keepships":{"title":"Keepships","content":"[[Keepships]] are unique, magical seafaring vessels of immense size. The carry small cities on their back, and seem to have a consciousness of their own. By all known magic, a keepship should not be able to stay afloat, let alone sail. The magic behind [[Keepships]] are a complete mystery to academia, and many hunt the secret to their creation. The three [[Keepships]] that were discovered were found shortly after [[The Awakening]]. Each hosts a few thousand inhabitants, and a unique culture. The ships set a course of their own, meaning the consciousness held within the ship dictates its path. The ships are known to spend their time within [[The Vast Sea]], and occasionally swing by cities so their inhabitants can conduct trade. Often when a keepship does this, many merchant boats will pull up alongside it like some strange form of a pop up market.\n\nThe ships each have their own form of governance. A **Keep Captain** rules the people, but no one can command the ships themselves. Some who hail from the keepship's claim to hear the ships voice, they talk about the ships almost as if they were small [[Gods]]. These accounts, which are shared on all of the ships, are the origin for each of their names. The ships Inhabitants claim to have heard it spoken to them. Laws are not formally placed on the ships, but the governing bodies do impose unwritten rules that the citizens are very familiar with. These rules echo what would be seen in most foreign cities. Things like murder, fraud, and thievery are outlawed. Though overall the ships rules are typically seen as very liberal.\n\nBeyond their amazing ability to sail, [[Keepships]] also posses a few other wonderous features. The first of which is a magical defense system. The consciousness of the ship can sense threats, and its cannons will fire on any hostility. They require no loading or ammunition. The ships are remarkably adept at combat too, so most threats steer clear of them. The vessels also provide accommodations like plumbing, and magical lighting. The final trait they posses is the ability to repair/grow portions of the ship in a matter of days. The Keepships will grow almost like a closing wound, or expand its size to accommodate a growing population. The latter occurs rarely, and is usually on a small scale.\n\n## The Aubrican\n![[The Aubrican.png]]\n\nThe most populated of the [[Keepships]]. The Aubrican is known for its eclectic, scrappy citizens. The ship is packed with small makeshift coffin-homes to accommodate its overgrown population. It has a loose governing power, headed by Keep Captain Sharn Swallow. Keep Captain Swallow is an old, portly human man who was able to make himself the ships leading power due to his vast economic resources as a previous life spent as a merchant. However many do not like the Keep Captain, and crime and disorder is a common occurrence on the ship. Though not all is grim on The Aubrican. Its inhabitants are known for their music and celebration. The Aubrican has a lot of parallels with [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]].\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Aubrican describe its personality as care-free, and fun loving.\n\n## The Eebezan\n![[The Eebezan.png]]\n\nThe smallest, and most orderly of the [[Keepships]]. The Eebezan is a marvel to [[Artificers]] as it is completely made of stone, yet floats as if it were of a much lighter material. Its Keep Captain, Relza Ghonne is a young and sharp minded half elven woman. She managed to strike relative order on a keepship (a thing few have achieved), and garnered the respect of many for it. The Eebezan has the most strict rules of the trio. To board the ship one must be invited, or cleared by the ships guard. Gaining citizenship is fathoms more difficult. The whole ship operates like a healthy inner-city district.\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Eebezan describe its personality as powerful, and authoritative.\n\n## The Khal Netresser\n![[The Khal Netresser.png]]\n\nThe cursed Keepship. The Khal Netresser is thought by many to be haunted, or cursed. It lives under the tyrannical rule of Keep Captain Arth K'vett, an intimidating aarakocra woman. Strange things occur on this vessel. Many wonder why its inhabitants do not flee the ship, however sociology dictates that most people fear leaving the life they know. Though some think their inability to leave is caused by something more sinister. The other [[Keepships]] fear it as when they pass each other (a rare occurrence), the other Keepships fire on The Khal Netresser.\n\nThose who claim to have heard the soul of The Khal Netresser describe its personality as haunting, eldritch, knowing, and other-worldly.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.815233612Z","tags":null},"/Kenku":{"title":"Kenku","content":"*Cursed Corvid*\n![[Kenku.png]]\n\n## Description\n[[Kenku]] are very few in number, and some think they are merely a thing of myth.

However they have adapted a unique method of communication with the ability to perfectly mimic any sound they hear (within reason). This allows them to form speech by quoting sentences and mixing and matching heard words into coherent communication. \n\nTheir odd existence is made all the more strange by the fact that no one knows where they came from.

This is largely because of [[The Crown Titans]], a powerful legion of fighters that responds only to [[King Galliard]]'s command.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The Megastructures of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Riverbridge]]'s Great Bridges that span the [[The Narrow Sea]].\n- The relationships amongst the human and non human population within the city are tense, and not overshadowed by the strange cultures of the mega structures\n- Many people believe in a strange creature that lurks in the city's sewers call [[The Oodillid]]\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.816233617Z","tags":null},"/Kinadhyne":{"title":"Kinadhyne","content":"*Wandering God, Moral of Natural Order*\n![[Kinadhyne.png]]\n\nWithin the movement of all things lies pattern, purpose, and prophecy.

Fighting between rival gangs, and local law start and stop suddenly within [[Kosskazoka]]. It is a constant effort of carefully quelling crime, without sparking bloodshed.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, the city is known as a city of excitement and gambling. Many adventurers travel here just to see what the city has to offer.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Kosskazoka]] has stood well against the tests of time. Its economy has been able to root deeply, making it a powerhouse of [[Laenwalde]].\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.822233647Z","tags":null},"/Laelanor":{"title":"Laelanor","content":"*The Tree-Top City of Wood Elves*\n![[laelanor skyline 2.png]]\n\nIn the far west, within the mystical forest of Yaa'fedell, on  the hilly coast of [[The Vast Sea]] rests the viridescent city of [[Laelanor]]. The city is amalgamated into the massive trunk of [[The Hailent Tree]], the largest of its rare species known as [[The Provident Oaks]]. Home to the Wood [[Elves]], the city's people are all raised with the lessons of [[The Path]]. A set of philosophies, skills, crafts, martial arts, stories, and histories that prepare one for 'a life worthy of living'.\n\nSimilar to its sister elven cities, it is not a place built for outsiders. However unlike the others it does allow visitors through an ancient law known as The Rite of Creszar. Stemming from a legend of a Dragonborn hero named Creszar who crossed [[The Three Corners]], and sought the sap of [[The Hailent Tree]] to cure his teacher of a great illness. He stayed for three days to regain his strength, and on each day of Creszar's time in [[Laelanor]], he proved himself to be a worthy guest of the city. The Rite of Creszar allows for anyone who seeks the power held within [[The Hailent Tree]] to come and stay within the city for no more than three sunrises. By the fourth sunrise, one must depart from the city and not return unless invited by the Maer, or after 50 days have passed.\n\n![[laelenor-map.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city is a place of peace and wisdom. All the city's people spend their early lives learning from [[The Path]], giving all of its citizens skills in medicine, craftsmanship, philosophy, history, mathematics, druidic magic, and combat. A population made up of very well rounded citizens makes for a very capable city. |\n| Main Challenge | Many outsiders feel that the city has its own unique brand of arrogance. The city's people feel that [[The Path]] is the be all, end all of knowledge. [[The Path]] is said to be the perfect way of learning and knowledge, and its only fault is the mortal understanding of it. This breeds a unique brand of stubborness that some joke \"would cause an elf to sit in a burning building if [[The Path]] deemed it meaningful.\" |\n| Climate | Temperate, costal |\n| Cuisine | Largely vegetarian meals, only meat consumed is wild game. Typically prepared in the form of Tapas. |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Small |\n| Outer Villages| None |\n| City Leader | Maer Sylas Ser'sal |\n| Primary Language(s) | Elvish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Wood [[Elves]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Trinity-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, hilly, built into a massive Provident Oak |\n| Architecture | Natural, earthen, live wood incorporated, asymmetrical  |\n| Color(s) | Green |\n| Symbolism | A silhouette of [[The Hailent Tree]] |\n| Defenses | Remote, forested, high-up, combat trained population |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group            | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| High Court       | Social Class     | The most highly respected members of the city.

Members serve terms of 15 years, and may or may not be renewed after that.

Their logs decide if a guest is allowed in or not.                                                                                    |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is ruled by Maer Sylas Ser'sal a considerably young ruler who is a bit of a controversy amongst his people. Some see him to be a refreshing, youthful influence on the city. Others think him to be foolish and na√Øve.\n\nThe Maer has a small, but highly trained soldiers. They are known for their skills with a bow, and ability to traverse complex terrain, leaving little trace.\n\n### Laws\nThe city enforces its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Murder | High | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission. It is a great criminal act |\n| Void Worship | High | One cannot conduct worship of the [[Void Gods]] |\n| Detrimental [[Necromancy]] | High | Necromantic magic that does not heal is considered a great crime. |\n| [[Antidescence]] | High | The usage of [[Antidescence]] is a great crime to the people of the city |\n| Thievery | Medium/High | Theft, breaking and entering, forgery, fraud, etc. is punished in respect to the severity of the crime |\n| Assault | Medium/High | Harming another without due cause in any manner is punished in respect to the severity of the harm done |\n| Organized Worship of Wandering Gods | Medium/High | Conducting worship of [[The Wandering Gods]] in an organized manner is not allowed.

Most interactions it has with the outside world are with travelling merchants, or those on a pilgrimage for healing, wisdom, or foreign treasures. It is quite difficult to navigate the dangerous forests surrounding the city, and it is almost required that one has a guide when travelling to [[Laelanor]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Laelanor]] has kept to themselves politically, but is a loyal supporter for any military campaigns of [[Gethsemane]]. Their scouts were instrumental during the [[Western War]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The city does not have a train station, or a teleportation circle. Making it very difficult to reach for the vast majority of the population.\n- Slavery is not of [[The Path]], and is not practiced within the city. However it is not illegal.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.822233647Z","tags":null},"/Laenwalde":{"title":"Laenwalde","content":"![[Laenwalde v3.jpg]]\n\nThe Unified Kingdoms of the West.

Many of the people of Saen hold true to the ancient ways of [[The Badlands]].\n\t- [[Kosskazoka]] - The Neon City\n\t- [[Diddan]] - The Wild West\n\t- [[Rockfire]] - The Volcanic Oasis\n\nAs well as a shared capital, The Floating City of [[Heliodor]] and its terrestrial sister settlement, [[Elysium Station]] which is located in Eucaren.\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nEach of Laenwalde's three regions has its own natural landscape that differs from its neighbors\n- **Arcadia** - A well mapped and inhabited island. The wilderness of the island is tamed more than most places of [[Zol]], but still presents moderate danger for those unprepared. It's north is full of the snowcapped peaks of [[The Auroran Summits]] which are inhabited by territorial [[Dragons]].\n- **Eucaren** - The wilderness of Eucaren is most associated with the beautiful Madre'ells. A vast expanse of forest covered hills. Known to be considerably tame at the edges of its wilderness, this region supplies the people of Eucaren with many resources. While reasonably safe, there are some great threats that reside in the deepest parts of the forest. Its north east contains [[The East Mounts]], a remarkably dangerous mountain range that is thought to be cursed in the teachings of [[Elves]]. Its north west extends into Yaa'fedell, the forest of the wood elves. This territory was gifted to Eucaren long ago as a thankful gift from the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] for their aid in war against [[The Glassius Reach]]. In the center of the region lie 2 ruined cities: Aefadel, and Lamour. Both were destroyed in the various conflicts of the region.\n- **Saen** - The Desert of [[The Three Corners]]. Saen is possesses great sand dunes, oases, the mesas of [[The Kodoros]], active volcanoes, and The Savanah. Its wilderness is extremely hostile but holds resources and treasure that can only be obtained within its sands. While the region is a challenge to traverse, an advancement in Apparatum technology known as [[Skimmers]] have made navigating the desert much easier.\n\nAll of Laenwalde is notably covered in ruins of old forts, castles, towns and other settlements. This is because of the frequent destruction that occurred during [[The Taming of the Badlands]].\n\n## History\nOnce know as The Badlands, a lawless wild of disordered society. Its chaos was quelled over a long effort known as [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. A long history of feudal battles, and large scale wars between various powers that rose and fell in a complicated political and military game.\n\nThis game took a much different appearance after the attack of [[The Castle of Bodies]], a horrible event that involved one of the [[Void Gods]] appearing in the [[Prime Material Plane]] and attacking the city of [[Audran]].\n\nAfter the chaos, a the ruling council discovered a living heir to the first king of [[Laenwalde]]. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed and the new capital [[Heliodor]] was constructed.\n\n*For a comprehensive telling of Laenwalde's history, see [[The Taming of the Badlands]]*\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe people of [[Laenwalde]] hail from all [[Races]] and have many different backgrounds and cultures. After [[The Awakening]], Laenwalde's region was more racially diverse than any other. This set aside many issues other regions faced, but made unification much more difficult.\n\nThe people of each region are stereotyped as follows:\n- **Arcadia** - Thought to be an overly proud and patriotic people. Those who hail from the island think that Arcadia is the 'true' heart of the kingdom as it is where the capital was once from and now homes the strongest military in [[Zol]].\n- **Eucaren** - Thought to be a soft and laid back people. The disproportionate population of [[Halflings]], finest alcohols, and proportionally safest wilderness in all of [[Zol]].\n- **Saen** - Thought to be a rough around the edges people. Gruff gun slinging westerners, dirty beggars of the neon city, or religious devotees of the volcanic temples. \n\nThe different groups manage a begrudging coexistence, with a great deal of prejudice. Eucaren tends to be a sort of exception to this. Its people are seen as simple, but extremely friendly. They are considered unproblematic all across [[Zol]]. They are typically welcomed anywhere.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nLaenwalde is ruled by [[King Tatelak II]] and his advisory council. This rule is conducted from the floating city of [[Heliodor]]. The instilment of [[King Tatelak II]] upon his throne in the flying city was done as an effort to rekindle the hope people once had for [[Laenwalde]]. However many feel there is a disconnect between the crown and its people. They were ruled by a council for so long and now feel that they are under the foot of a distant leader. The King's disposition is well intentioned, but in reality he is inexperienced and it has been a large change for [[Laenwalde]].\n\nLaenwalde's economy is quite self sufficient when it needs to be, the kingdom is large enough to provide all resources they reasonably require. However there is a fair deal of trade of rare imports and exports from the east.\n\nThe [[Laenwalde Laws]] are consistent across all regions. This is good for maintaining order, but difficult for some as many feel that the laws should not be enforced as a wide net for all the regions and their cities. They instead push for each region having its own set of laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nThe regions of [[Laenwalde]] all have a unique art and culture associated with them:\n- **Arcadia** - known for upholding the ideals of success, glory and being well mannered. Its ideals are presented in its art in examples like: realism, complex musical compositions, glamorous fashion, and rare foods.\n- **Eucaren** - known for treasuring the ideals of community and the natural world. This is seen in its art as: simple instruments played with a high degree of skill, highly stylized paintings, and dramatic storytelling\n- **Saen** - known for idealizing the concepts of strength and enduring hardship. Its art manifests as martial combat, weapon craftsmanship, large narrative murals, and sculptures.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademia in [[Laenwalde]] is almost exclusively associated with [[The University]]. An institution that explores all three of [[The Wills]], each with a dedicated branch of The University:\n- The [[Arcanum]], focused on the pursuit of [[Arcana]]. Its primary campuses located within the city of [[Ryze]] and [[Audran]].\n- The [[Viridium]], focused on the understanding of the natural world through [[Viridescence]]. Its primary campus located in [[Kahdinacht]].\n- The [[Observum]], focused on forming and comprehending mortal bonds with [[Gods]]. Its primary campuses located within [[Rockfire]] and [[Penthe]].\n- \nThe [[Arcanum]] is by far the largest branch of [[The University]]. This is because [[Arcana]] best fits to conventional academics. Its counterparts deal with two main factors that make its pursuit much more difficult to approach empirically:\n- The experience of using one of these wills ([[Observance]] or [[Viridescence]]) is very subjective and differs from person to person\n- There is no sure-fire method of gaining the ability to use these wills. They require patience, skill, and a rare predisposition to access\nBecause of this, the majority of the members of these branches are non-magic-practicing academics.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe people of the kingdom are in a strange place. For many years they have been governed by a council. This council was fairly adept at allocating resources and maintaining general order. However the frequent drama, espionage, intrigue, and assassinations that occurred amongst the council appeared as poor rulership to its people. This, mixed with the hardships like: high taxes, overpopulation, conflicts between locals and law enforcement, and clashing cultures made for poor public opinions of rulership and general unhappiness within the kingdom.\n\nIn an effort to combat this, the council instilled a new king. A long lost direct descendant of the kingdom's first, and beloved ruler. [[King Tatelak II]] was put on the throne with the council as his advisors. The new rule is conducted from the new capital of [[Heliodor]].\n\nThis change has altered opinions. Some for better and some for worse. Many think it is good to have a sole king and not the chaotic rule of the council. Others feel that the king is distant, detached, and inexperienced upon his throne in the flying city.\n\n## Military\nTacticians frequently argue who has the more fearsome military: [[Gethsemane]] or [[Laenwalde]]. [[Laenwalde]] has the largest army by far. The kingdoms is so grand and diverse it makes up for any lack of quality with quantity. The only hope an outside foe (other than possibly [[Gethsemane]]) would have of defeating them would be to re-open the political divides that exist between the three regions.\n\n## Borders\nThe Kingdom contains the mountain ranges of:\n- [[The East Mounts]]\n- [[The Auroran Summits]]\n- [[The Kodoros]]\n\nThe Kingdom Borders the Kingdom of:\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n\nThe Kingdom also Borders the Wild of:\n- [[The Kulpis Desert]]\n\nAnd has coasts on:\n- [[The Archsea]]\n- [[The Vast Sea]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.825233662Z","tags":null},"/Laenwalde-Laws":{"title":"Laenwalde Laws","content":"This set of laws contains many of the main crimes that one could commit within [[Laenwalde]].\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Murder | High | If one kills outside of self defense, or does not have governmental permission.

However, many academics believe it is central to understanding the nature of [[Zol]]'s history.\n\n*Each listed language has its own script. If a language has regional subsections, these regions can communicate with one another, but their dialects differ slightly. Academics expect that directly after [[The Undoing]], these regional languages were the same, but time has caused them to diverge.*\n\n## Languages of [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]:\n- Widely Spoken Languages\n\t- Common\n\t\t- The mysterious language spoken by all people after [[The Awakening]]. It is not know how this language is shared by all cultures. Those born after [[The Awakening]] needed it to be taught to them.\n\t\t- Strangely, the language seems to be able to grow to hold new words, but it remains very constant in its structure. It seems strangely impervious to the passage of time, unlike other languages. \n\t- Elvish\n\t\t- Gethsemnean Elvish\n\t\t\t- The Elven tongue spoken by elves of [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]] \n\t\t- Eastern Elvish\n\t\t\t- The Elven tongue spoken by elves of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Ward]].\n\t- Dwarvish\n\t\t- Moddian Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The language of [[Mod Dranor]]\n\t\t- Laen Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The Dwarven tongue of [[Laenwalde]]\n\t\t- Eastern Dwarvish\n\t\t\t- The Dwarven tongue spoken by elves of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Ward]].\n\t- Human\n\t\t- Kapeshian Human\n\t\t\t- The Human language of the east\n\t\t- Laen Human\n\t\t\t- The Human language of the west\n\t- Orcish\n\t\t- Ka'thoorin Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in the east\n\t\t- Laen Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in the west\n\t\t- Ward Orcish\n\t\t\t- The specific brand of Orcish common in [[The Ward]]\n\t- Goblin\n\t\t- The language of goblinoids. Commonly spoken in the wilderness. Its structure is very informal so it does not have listed variants.\n\t- Giant\n\t\t- The pleasantly simplistic language of [[Giants]] and [[Firbolgs]]. Its simplicity makes it have no major regional differences.\n\t- Smallfolk\n\t\t- The language of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]]. A very slang-filled dialect. Varies from city to city, even sometimes district to district, that recording variants is a long winded effort. However at its core it is very uniform.\n\t- Changeling\n\t\t- The language of [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\t- Aarakocran\n\t\t- The language of Aarakocran. Has few words compared to other languages, and is largely based on tone of voice to denote meaning. Very hard to speak if you are not an [[Aarakocra]]. Spoken mostly in [[Reach Run]].\n- Lesser Known Languages\n\t- Witchtongue\n\t\t- A language used amongst the many differing groups of [[The Witchlands]]. Sometimes called Druidic.\n\t- Draconic\n\t\t- The language of [[Dragons]] and [[Dragonborn]]. Extremely complex, and hard to learn. If variants exist, they are not well documented.\n\t- Sunfiend\n\t\t- A rarely used language of the [[Tieflings]], similar to Damnian.\n\t\t- Due to its relationship with hell, it is not often used as many see it as taboo.\n\t- Triton\n\t\t- An uncommon dialect used by subaqueous people. The only two known places where it is used frequently are [[Abdjadan]] and [[Yoel Sundarum]]. There are slight differences in the two dialects, but it is largely negligible.\n\t- Subaqueous Hand Signs\n\t\t- A form of visual communication for usage underwater. Does not have a written equivalent. Commonly used in [[Yoel Sundarum]].\n\t- Owlin\n\t\t- The rare and sing-song language of [[Owlin]]\n\t- Beastspeech\n\t\t- The informal language of [[Beastfolk]]\n\t- Grung\n\t\t- The language of [[Grung]] tribes. Each tribe has their own different take on the language. Involves a fair bit of croaking which makes it difficult for non-Grung to speak.\n\t- Tabaxi\n\t\t- The fast-spoken language of the [[Tabaxi]]. Many early tabaxi were nomadic, so the language is widely the same across [[The Three Corners]].\n\t- Harengon\n\t\t- The complicated language of the [[Harengon]]. Difficult to learn, but well loved by linguists for its complexity, and intelligent design.\n\t- Genasi\n\t\t- A language of complex, four sided, verbiage. Spoken only within [[Ep Drukar]]\n- Fringe Languages\n\t- Illithid\n\t\t- A barely understood language of the alien [[Illithids]]\n\t- Fae'n\n\t\t- The language of the [[Fey]]\n\t- Fell'n\n\t\t- The language of the [[Fell]]\n\t- Void Tongue\n\t\t- The poorly understood language of monsters from [[The Void]].\n\t\t- Many academics suspect that what is perceived as Void Tongue, is actually many languages grouped together from lack of understanding.\n\t- Damnian\n\t\t- The language of [[Fiends]] from [[Damnation]].\n\t- Seraphic\n\t\t- The language that is spoken by the celestials of gods. Many celestials, who act as acolytes for different gods, all speak Seraphic. Because of this, some scholars suspect it something developed by gods for the purpose of communication between beings of this nature.\n\n## Inferences About Old Zol and Language\nMany people of [[Zol]] believe in the concept of [[The Triumvirate]]. However the diversity of [[Language]] which exists within [[Zol]] (which was catalogued during [[The Rebuilding]]) spans a wide range of dialects. Some think this is a product of [[The Undoing]], others believe they are artifacts of [[Old Zol]]. A few even believe that they were composed shortly after [[The Awakening]]. However, linguists believe this to be inaccurate. It is widely known that all people knew the language of Common, and it would not have been practical for them to devise new means of communication. If they did, it would have likely been rooted in Common. However no other language is rooted in Common as far as scholars can tell. \n\n## The First Tongue and The Old Tongue Viewed as Languages\nThere is some confusion surrounding the nature of [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] when compared to other language. Standard language carries the purpose of communication, while [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] carry immense magical power. These magical \"languages\" are not forms of communication, but are rather understood as foundational pieces of reality.\n\n[[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]] are more akin to a set of names and commands rather than a spoken language.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.825233662Z","tags":null},"/Larkleaf":{"title":"Larkleaf","content":"A rare plants that only grows in the shade of [[The Kodoros]].

It manifests in 3 ways called [[The Wills]]. \n\n![[spheres of magic diagram.png]]\n\nIt is the poorly understood force that drives everything in [[Zol]].\n\n- [[Observance]], which is magic lent by beings of great power or derived from a spiritual bond formed with the soul of the world itself, [[The Trinity]]. Each individual who utilizes this will does so in a manner that is entirely unique to them. It can manifest as a radiant light that guides those who are lost, a dark power that draws in the vulnerable, and everything in between.\n- [[Viridescence]], which is magic found everywhere in nature. A source which requires great understating of, or domination over the natural world. This power allows anyone to bend nature to their will, and even bend their own form to that of the natural world.\n- [[Arcana]], the unbalanced, untied, and chaotic power that saturates [[Zol]]. Arcana can be harnessed in an uncountable number of ways, but even scratching the surface of just one of these methods requires great knowledge, talent, and years of practice; however some gifted individuals can perform these acts based on their innate ability alone. Study of the Arcane can show one the great and wonderful secrets of the world, but can also drive some to madness.\n\n[[The Wills]] come from [[The Trinity]] and the rules that bind it called [[The First Tongue]]. This binding formed the very stone, sea, and sky of [[Zol]]. As well as the [[Magic]] that resides in it. By this rule, all magic in [[Zol]] must adhere to [[The Wills]] even if it hails from outside [[Zol]].\n\n[[The First Tongue]] itself is a power one can learn to control. It allows one to bend the rules of [[Zol]], as it is in its essence the rules themselves. Individuals who achieve full and uncontested mastery over a facet [[Zol]] may discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. In doing so they can perform wonderous feats of magic akin to that the [[Gods]]. This is the rarest and most difficult skill in all of [[Zol]].\n\nAs use of [[The First Tongue]] is nigh impossible, other methods of harnessing the wills are utilized by the bulk of magic wielders in Zol. These other methods are:\n- [[Vizir]], a fragment of the Trinity that exists in all beings. When harnessed it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way.\n- [[The Old Tongue]], the language that followed [[The First Tongue]]. While it is not nearly as powerful, it is much more diverse. It allows one to wield [[The Wills]] in a major way. Knowledge of this force may come with great secrets and dark truths about Zol.\n- [[Lent Power]], is power given by some wonderous source or great being other than [[The Trinity]]. When this power is bestowed upon an individual, it allows for them to channel the power of a greater being through their [[Vizir]] or learn [[The Old Tongue]] through a divine entity. This power cannot come from outside of [[The Trinity]] entirely. As all magic in [[Zol]] must be passed through it before reaching its intended target.\n\n![[Magic Diagram.png]]\n\n## Magic and Society\nThe people of [[Zol]] largely base their society and culture around some sort of magic. Safety and technology at a high level depend almost entirely on magic. This creates a strange dynamic for most of the population as only about 5% of individuals have the capacity to harness magic via gifts or training.\n\n[[Caster]]s are revered and feared because of this. The cultures and mythos of [[Zol]] are so intertwined with magic that no belief or practice is without mention of it.\n\n## Advancements in Magic\nFor almost all of history, one could not access magical power unless they followed the specific known rules, bore some gift, or possessed an item that had undergone [[Enchantment]] via superbly powerful magic called [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. This was all changed when the great arcanist [[Maalvern]] discovered [[Iron Light]] and established the trade of [[Artificers]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] is a sub section of the minor will of [[Arcana]]. It allows one to extend their [[Vizir]] into an object, and produce a magical result. This is done by using rudimentary runes inscribed in iron plates, allowing for a more simplistic production of magical objects. This invention revolutionized [[Zol]].\n\n## Limitations and Weaknesses of Magic\nWhile powerful, Magic is not a boundless tool. In all cases, a [[Caster]] acts as a conduit for [[The Trinity]]. Acting as this conduit requires capacity and fortitude called **Equipoise**, respective to the given task.  \n\nEquipoise is a medical term used to denote the balance of ones homeostasis, mental state, and magical capability. It is a careful balance that the body strives towards at all times. Every being has a different level of this balance. Some beings can withstand more imbalance than others.\n\nUse of any Magic, save for [[The First Tongue]], directly interferes with one's Equipoise. This can manifest as the body dropping in temperature, exhaustion, hunger, nausea, weakness, dizziness, and temporarily decreased magical ability.\n\nIt is common for novice mages to become bedridden for a few hours after their first use of magic. Skilled mages do not even notice these negative effects when using simple spells.\n\nEquipoise can be trained like a muscle over time, and seems to have no upward limit. This skill is thought to be parallel, or even interchangeable, with the strength of ones [[Vizir]]. \n\nWhen one stops using magic, the body does what it can to return to a normal Equipoisal state; however it cannot recover lost energy. This means a body can only take so much stress before it needs hours of rest paired with nutrition to regain lost Equipoise. \n\nStress can be mitigated by expanding one's Equipoisal capacity. If an individual has great skill, or some innate gift they can use magic in more efficient ways to lessen the equipoisal imbalance. The amount of magic a [[Caster]] can use before causing permanent damage to themselves is referred to as their equipoisal limit. \n\nIf one does reach their equipoisal limit, they are not cut off from magic. They are instead punished greatly by any further usage. This is called [[Magical Backfire]].\n\n## Perspectives of Magic\nMuch of what is written and taught about [[Magic]] comes from Academic Arcanists. In modern times, the public understanding of [[Magic]] is somewhat biased towards the academic perspective. [[Clerics]], [[Druids]], occultists, [[Witches]], and many more have perspectives of magic that differ greatly, and even sometimes contradict the academic perspective. \n\nMost cases of [[Magic]] usage outside of academia are not recorded, tested, and debated like they are in Academic [[Arcana]]. This is because each usage is much more individualistic and personal. There is also much less need for it as these groups tend to begin their journey with gifts, or help from an outside source. The most obvious exception to this is [[The University]]'s [[Viridium]] and [[Observum]]; the two most organized institutions of their respective wills.\n\n## Categories of Magic\nThe usage of magic gives off a unique informational [[Energy]] signature no matter the source, will used, or the [[Caster]] themselves. These signatures are called the [[Schools of Magic]] and they tell much about the nature of the magic being used.\n\n## Forces Beyond Magic\nMany believe magic to be an all encompassing force to describe [[Zol]], but there are some who believe there is other power within the world that does not come from [[Zol]] and even operate outside of [[The Trinity]]. Any academic evidence of this is purely theoretical, and is largely viewed as some portion of [[The Trinity]] that is not yet understood. Some theologians however, claim to be quite sure of these sources of power. A large example of this is that of the [[Church of The Hum]] in [[Holyfield]]\n\nThe popularized theories for other sources are:\n- [[The Hum]] - a strange force that exists in [[Holyfield]]\n- [[The Mortal Coil]] - the force of life and death itself. Many Believe it to be part of [[The Trinity]], but others disagree based on the nature of the [[Planes]] and [[Necromancy]].\n- [[The Anger of the Stars]] - a strange phenomenon observed as power that radiates from somewhere deep in [[The Cosmos]].\n- [[The Anti-Trinity]] - a mythical force associated with [[The Shroud of the Void]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.826233667Z","tags":null},"/Magical-Backfire":{"title":"Magical Backfire","content":"Magical backfire is the result of improper usage or over-usage of [[Magic]].

In the case of damage to one's [[Vizir]], it results as a [[Caster]] having their magical capacity decreased, or lost entirely.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.826233667Z","tags":null},"/Magical-Metals":{"title":"Magical Metals","content":"Within [[Zol]] there are many different naturally occurring materials which can be used across many types of craftsmanship. Some of these are naturally magical metals which are highly sought after. \n\n## Types of Metal\n\nWhat follows is a list containing some of [[Zol]]'s magical metals. Magical metals are not limited to this list, but these are the most commonly referenced in academic materials.\n\n*Rarity is based on how easily acquirable it is to society. Some metals are so rare that their existence is questioned. These metals are noted as 'Mythical'*\n\n| Metal | Rarity | Properties |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Iron | Very Common | Can be inscribed with runes from the [[Ferric Alphabet]], allowing for the metal to interface with one's [[Vizir]], producing [[Iron Light]], acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fey]] |\n| Silver | Common | Acts as a bane for many creatures from the [[Fell]] |\n| Gold | Common | Emits radiant [[Energy]] |\n| Mythril | Rare | [[Mythril]] is an extremely strong metal that emits very potent [[Diaphanous Magic]], very culturally significant to [[Dwarves]] and their religion. Mythril is famous for its harmonious compatibility with other magical materials. |\n| Giant's Bone | Rare | Fossils of ancient [[Giants]] that can be smelted into potent metals. Properties depend on samples, but include things like: high density and low weight, elemental [[Energy]], increasing physical abilities of living creatures. Modern Giant's Bone does not posses this quality, it must be of a fossil. |\n| Dragon Scale | Rare | Scales from [[Dragons]] of at least 100 years of age. These scales can be smelted into potent metals, or incorporated into creations in their raw form. The older the Dragon the scales came from, the more rare and powerful the magic. Scales from a dragon over 500 years are very rare, and over 1000 years are extremely rare. When used correctly, dragon scale can produce immense magical effects. |\n| Adamantine | Very Rare | One of the hardest known naturally occurring substances. Extremely sought after by armorers and weapon smiths |\n| Faenite | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fey]]. Possesses strange, and untethered magic which is often called Wild Magic. |\n| Beastmetal | Very Rare | A metal found only within the [[Fell]]. Similar to Iron in many of its properties, Beastmetal is made unique by the fact that is has been found to provoke violence in it those around it. This is most obvious on wild beasts. It also has a small range of lesser know effects such as its ability to absorb light, and things of similar nature. |\n| Dimeritium | Very Rare | A metal found in the deep [[The Underdark]]. It possesses strange antimagical abilities. Its function is understood as emitting an ever-decaying field of raw magical [[Energy]]. This disrupts other [[Magic]] exposed to the field, as well as one's connection to [[The Trinity]]. Sometimes called *Magebane*. |\n| Potentium | Very Rare | A rare metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It can be imbued with magical [[Energy]] changing the material properties and structure of the metal permanently. Doing so is a great challenge, but is extremely useful. Often used to make weapons and ammunitions. Potentium, when charged, is said to be able to influence the properties of other nearby non-magical metals. Making them more akin to their own structure temporarily. Similar to how a Loadstone can influence other metals to be magnetic. |\n| Momentium | Very Rare | A strange metal found only as small flecks within the western sands of [[Saen]]. It has an amplifying effect on any momentum applied to it. Often used in Firearms and [[Skimmers]]. |\n| Meteoric Shard | Extremely Rare | Foreign metal of cosmic origin. Suspected to be sourced from meteorites from [[The Cosmos]]. Only found within the western sands of [[Saen]] and The Ghalt Kratur of [[The Witchlands]]. All recovered shards are of a common material, but each recorded use of their application produces a unique magical effect. Little is understood about Meteoric Shards |\n| Seraphium | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]. It has immense magical properties. Many holy relics are comprised of Seraphium. Its properties cover a wide spectrum, but it is know to produce wonderous magic, strength, durability, and energetic capacity. |\n| Void Slag | Extremely Rare | Metal said to hail from [[The Void]]. It's unholy status, and unpredictable effects have secured it a special place in myth and academia. Those have tampered with it have said it is extremely difficult to work with, and produces *undesirable* effects. |\n| Hag Metal | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in folklore regarding [[Hags]]. Said to be so toxic, that touching it can cause it to absorbed through the skin, forever changing a person. There are a small collection of mythical weapons said to be made from it. |\n| Morhin | Mythical | Unknown. It is referenced in religious texts regarding [[The Wandering Gods]], said to be so desirable even gods seek it out. |\n\n## Potentium Sub-Metals\nWhen Potentium is exposed to a high concentration of elemental [[Energy]], its alchemical structure and magical properties can be permanently altered. Once altered, it cannot be altered again, or alloyed with any known metal. It is even possible to infuse Potentium with multiple types of elemental [[Energy]] to create hybrids, given you expose it to the correct energy concentrations simultaneously.\n\nThe Potentium Sub-Metals are:\n\n| # | Name | Elemental Energy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ignitium | Fire |\n| 2 | Fridigite | Cold |\n| 3 | Excitium | Lightning |\n| 4 | Necrodite | Necrosis |\n| 5 | Radallium | Radiant |\n| 6 | Toxium | Poison |\n| 7 | Corrodium | Acid |\n\nHybrids between Potentium Sub-Metals are extremely difficult to make. They are often called by their elemental numbers. Potentium exposed to lightning and radiant [[Energy]] in the correct concentrations becomes *III-IV Potentium*.\n\n## Other information\n- [[Artificers]] often refer to [[Magical Metals]] as *Strong* metals. This isn't in reference to their physical strength (however, many magical metals are quite strong which is known to further confusion amongst non-academics). It is instead in reference to their strong magical potential. Non-magical metals such as tin, zinc, and mercury are referred to as Weak Metals. These names are reflected in the [[Ferric Alphabet]] table.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.826233667Z","tags":null},"/Malevolan":{"title":"Malevolan","content":"*To Know*\n![[Malevolan.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Malevolan]] worship is a denomination of religion used to describe any faith that follows a dark entity, typically the [[Void Gods]].

He has lived like this for over 2 dozen years and will likely live another decade.*\n\n## Cause\nMateriation occurs when a complex [[Iron Light]] [[Apparatum]] involves an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. Using these devices is hard on one's physical body. The exact reason for its occurrence is unknown.\n\n## Symptoms\nWhile frightening to observers, the affliction is described casually by its victims. While fatal, the afflicted claim to enjoy the experience as it makes them feel one with the world.\n\nThe ailment seems to give its victims a unique wisdom, euphoria, as well as a slight disconnect from society.\n\nWhile fatal, the condition progresses slowly and is not accelerated by continued usage of dangerous [[Apparatum]]. Many afflicted live relatively normal lives ten to fifty years beyond diagnosis.\n\nThe bodies of the afflicted strangely continue to function even without vital organs that are removed or damaged by the disease. It is only fatal when it takes the brain or a vital section of spine.\n\nEven after death the corpses of the afflicted continue to materiate.

It was discovered in the early 4th millennium.\n\nIt is the process of creating an [[Apparatum]] so complex, a soul bonds to it via [[The Mortal Coil]]. Originally discovered by accident when [[Artificers]] were attempting to develop a [[Low Automata]] pen that could act as a scribe for someone who was dictating to it. When the pen began writing of its own volition, a massive surge of innovation began. The pen is now known as \"Professor Quill\" and can still be found within [[The University]]'s artificery.\n\nA subservient race of beings called [[Warforged]] were developed to originally fight in the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. This accelerated the conflict from both sides significantly. The destruction that could be committed by forces of soldiers that did not need sleep not sustenance was immense. The mass production of combat ready [[Warforged]] was stopped when some of them began to be damaged in specific ways that gave them free will.\n\nThese [[Warforged]] would then go on to damage other [[Warforged]], causing a chain reaction. Drastic measures had to be taken to destroy the rouge constructs, and it became known that using [[Warforged]] in large numbers was not strategically viable.\n\nSoon after slaves began to be replaced by the much more efficient mechanical counterpart. The name [[Warforged]] stuck even though they were longer just used for battle.\n\nNo one knows exactly how [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] works. The phenomenon poses an unending list of academic and philosophical questions [[Zol]] has yet to answer.\n\n## Limitations to Mechanicum Immaculatum\n[[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] is a strange, and complex phenomena that is hard to measure. Nine times out of ten a being who experiences [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] dies within seconds of coming to life. It is not known why this is, but it makes creating [[Warforged]] a major challenge and a huge time investment.\n\nSapient beings created through [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] can be made with physical or magical abilities, however there seems to be diminishing returns with the powers invested into them during their creation. It is very difficult to create a [[Warforged]] that is as powerful as a master of martial arts, or a well trained arcanist. However their power can increase after they gain a soul in the same way other living creatures can.\n\nStrangely, [[Apparatum]] created by [[Warforged]] cannot undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]. This means [[Warforged]] cannot reproduce on their own. It is not known why this is.\n\n## Low Automata\nIt is common for individuals to get confused between [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] giving life to [[Warforged]], and the complex manufacturing of [[Low Automata]]. Low Automata are simplistic beings crafted through [[Magic]] that exist similarly to [[Warforged]]. However [[Low Automata]] do not have a true soul bound to them, and therefore do not undergo [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.835233713Z","tags":null},"/Metallic-Dragons":{"title":"Metallic Dragons","content":"See [[Dragons]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.835233713Z","tags":null},"/Mimic":{"title":"Mimic","content":"See [[Mimics]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.835233713Z","tags":null},"/Mimics":{"title":"Mimics","content":"[[Mimics]], also called *Ayadon'ae* by the [[Changelings]] are a species of beings who hail from [[The Glassius Reach]]. The posses the ability to alter their form similarly to [[Changelings]]. However, [[Mimics]] are known to impersonate objects, rather than people. Beyond that, ancient mimics are immensely powerful.\n\n## Origin\nMimics are incredibly secretive beings. Most of what is known about them is drawn from legend and speculation. It is said that the first generation of [[Mimics]] were stones animated by some force. There are those who believe they were made by the [[Gods]], others think them a product of [[The Oldshards]]. There are myths of them being holy protectors of something ancient, and there are those of them being dangerous monsters from [[The Void]].\n\nIn either case, they are said to be born in generations. The First Generation of [[Mimics]] were granted immense [[Magic]] which allowed them to create other mimics. Each generation with slightly different powers. Though it is said that only the first was capable of creating other [[Mimics]]. Academics believe that the older a Mimic is, the more intelligent and powerful it is. Making each generation slightly less powerful as a product of time.\n\nMost modern day [[Mimics]] that are encountered are more akin to beasts, or simplistic monsters. They spend long periods of time pretending to be objects that devour prey when they get close. Though there are accounts of ancient mimics being encountered, who are all extremely dangerous and intelligent.\n\n## Society\nLegends speak of a secret society of [[Mimics]] within [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Some say that they live in dark caves, others believe that they have a city of their own. There are no formal records of this place. In Glassian Lore, this place is called *Mastara*.\n## Physiology\n[[Mimics]] have complete control over the physiology. They can change their body to any size and shape. However the larger they are, the more food they need to sustain themselves.\n\nYounger generations of [[Mimics]] must remain completely still for their forms to be convincing, but later generations can do wonderous feats like making themselves appear as living things.\n## Relationship to The Oldshards\nThe few encounters that have been recorded with the earlier generations of [[Mimics]] describe some fascination, or reverence with [[The Oldshards]]. It is not known why they orbit around their locations.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.835233713Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Topics":{"title":"Miscellaneous Topics","content":"*This is an index of various topics which quite relevant to the world, but are either tucked away deep within the pages, or do not have a proper home.

[[Mod Dranor]] is one of the largest cities in [[Zol]]. It is a subterranean marvel of carved stone and expertly crafted infrastructure. Located deep in the heart of of the great mountain, [[Kalamdola]], the city spans three massive caverns within the mountain.\n\nThe city is divided into three main sub-cities: \n- **Providence** - The central sub-city of Dwarven Honor. At its entrance lies the Great Stone Door, the main entrance to the city. At the center of Providence lies the beautiful palace of Keep Dranor. Its north road leads to Timber Forge, its east road leads to Watchers Crest, and its south road leads to The Great Stone Door![[mod_dranor_-_providence.png]] \n\n- **Watcher's Crest** - The deepest part of Mad Dranor. This section of city does not allow outsiders, as its grounds are considered to be holy amongst dwarves as it was the first place [[Mythril]] was discovered. It is also where most of the city's mining operations are based. ![[mod_dranor_-_watchers_crest.png]]\n\n- **Timber Forge** - The sub-city of dwarven craft. Timber Forge is not directly attached to the city's main entrance, but it is the closest to the surface. This is because of the Raven Tower. A large structure that spans from the cavern's floor to the ceiling, with a large lift in it's center. The Raven Tower serves the purpose of moving resources from the surface down into the city.

Within the city one can find some of the most skilled craftsmen in all of [[The Three Corners]], as well as ancient histories and even secrets dating all the way back to [[The Awakening]].  |\n| Main Challenge | [[Dwarves]] are famously stubborn, and a city founded on literal ages of stubbornness is bound to have its problems. While orderly and grand, [[Mod Dranor]] has rivalries between dwarven houses, and even rivalries between sub-cities at times.

These Dwarves act as the nobility of the city. Unlike the nobility of many other cultures, members of great houses associate with common citizens with a high degree of regularity. Their culture does not put them in a position of power over common citizens like it does in foreign cities. It is more that they are viewed with a greater respect, and they come from a line of very notable dwarves. However it should be said that some individual dwarves do look down on others in this manner, but it is not a significant cultural influence. The heads of these families all sit on The Dwarven Council who aide The King in his duties. The amount of great houses varies over the years, but tends to hover around 10 to 15 families. |\n| The Common People               | Social Class      | The Vast Majority. These dwarves are the general population of the city. There is a spectrum of economical divide in the city, but it is no where near as wide as what exists in many other cities. Even the least fortunate are able to have standard comforts. The young, sick, and elderly who do not posses a means to an end are taken care of as well. Dwarven pride and honor is extremely important to these people, and will welcome any respectful guest with open arms. This hospitality increases exponentially to any dwarven visitor not originally from [[Mod Dranor]].

It exports many resources like rare metals, or finely made tools and armaments across [[The Three Corners]]. Many common folk view it with awe, as the great dwarven city is deeply set within myth and rumor. However many also know it personally as it is the only city within [[Gethsemane]] that is easily accessible via [[The Iron Tracks]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nIn the past, [[Mod Dranor]] has been known for withstanding the greatest test of time. It stood strong against powerful [[Dragons]] during [[The Dragon War]]. Its Great Stone Door kept much of the [[Beast Ire]] plague at bay, and its powerful armies fought bravely against [[The Illithid Invasion]].\n\nIts allies benefitted greatly from their military support during the [[Triumvirate Battles]] and the [[Western War]]. Despite their short stature, the [[Dwarves]] of [[Mod Dranor]] stand tall in the history books.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- [[Mod Dranor]] bears no specific colors, however the city is so distinct and well known that its exports, people, and armies are easy to distinguish without it\n- Slavery is practiced within the city, but they are not allowed to work within the mines, or workshops of the city\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.836233718Z","tags":null},"/Mount-Zerstel":{"title":"Mount Zerstel","content":"The Volcanic Mountain of [[Rockfire]], home to the Fire God [[Daetro]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.837233723Z","tags":null},"/Mythril":{"title":"Mythril","content":"An exceptionally magical metal found only within [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]].

It is magic that involves meddling with a living or dead creatures life-force. Its name, comes from '*necro*' the human word for death. This name was associated with the school early-on as it wasn't discovered until later that healing magic, called *Amelioration*, gave off the same Informational [[Energy]] as [[Necromancy]]. [[Necromancy]] stuck as the name as many scholars argued that even healing has to do with the recomposition of life force; however some who practice the older arts still call healing magic Amelioration. \n\nWhile powerful, Amelioration is not boundless. It can be used to attempt to restore the dead back to life, but it does not always work. Amelioration also cannot regrow lost limbs, but it can reattach them if the limb is not too damaged. It is also difficult to accurately regrow major internal damage to organs, bone, nerve and blood vessels. Those very skilled with Amelioration can do it, but most will leave the body repaired, but slightly off. This is why non-magical surgeons are able to make a career.\n\nIt is considered to be the most controversial school as it possesses the power of healing wounds and disease, but can also extend ones life far beyond that of a normal mortal, or even bring the dead back to life. With [[Necromancy]], one can toy with the bond between soul, and vessel.\n\nThe usage of [[Necromancy]] spawns massive ethical, and theological debate. The general population is made very uncomfortable by any usage of this magic that is not used for healing. All non healing magic is considered a crime in [[Laenwalde]], [[The Glassius Reach]], [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Ward]].\n\n## Effects of Necromancy on a User\nAny long term usage of this magic outside the realm of general healing seems to have a dark effect on one's mind and body. Physicality tends towards something monstrous in nature, and the individual's mind begins to lose the concept of empathy. It is not known why this happens. This does not seem to occur to those who revivify the dead with good intent.\n\nAny individual brought fully back to life via [[Necromancy]] permanently receives the mortality rune from the [[Ferric Alphabet]] somewhere on their body. This is commonly referred to as a [[Death Scar]] Successive revivals chain together It is not known as to why this happens, but there is a lot of superstition around these individuals. This contributed to the discovery of [[Iron Light]].\n\n![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\n## Necromancy and The Mortal Coil\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is a strange force that drives all life and death in [[Zol]]. [[Necromancy]] and [[The Mortal Coil]] are two parallel forces, however they are not one and the same.\n\nNecromancers utilize the laws known about [[The Mortal Coil]] and the tools [[Necromancy]] provides to cheat death by artificially conducting the actions [[The Mortal Coil]] takes naturally. [[Necromancy]] does not give power over [[The Mortal Coil]], it merely circumvents, steals, and tricks souls into doing the [[Caster]]'s bidding.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.837233723Z","tags":null},"/Nodes":{"title":"Nodes","content":"see [[Space, Matter, and Energy]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.837233723Z","tags":null},"/Nothingness":{"title":"Nothingness","content":"See [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.837233723Z","tags":null},"/Nullity-Text":{"title":"Nullity Text","content":"See [[The Grand Nothing]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.837233723Z","tags":null},"/Numerology":{"title":"Numerology","content":"Numbers are tied to many ideals within Zol.

It is [[Magic]] derived from another being, or conscious source of power. It is also referred to as [[Lent Power]]. The lending of this power comes from a bond between an individual and their source. Some examples of this bond are:\n- Devout Religious Belief\n- A Pact\n- A linked bloodline\n- Personal Bond\n\nAnd many others. This bond is not so easily gained.\n\nThe bond requires some direct connection to the source. A priest may spend his whole life devoting themselves to one of the [[Gods]], but that god may not see this person as a fit for their power and influence. Contrarily a priest may have been given a gift but never have sought it out in the first place.\n\nThese bonds typically come with visions, and sometimes the ability to speak directly to the source. \n\nThe power from a bond is only as strong as the bond itself, and can become more powerful or weaken overtime. There are many records of individuals losing their bond entirely, or growing so strong that an individual embodies a large portion of their god's power for a brief moment.\n\nAs is true for all [[Magic]] in [[Zol]], power from [[Observance]] must first pass through [[The Trinity]] before reaching its user. Many who utilize the will of [[Observance]] draw from [[The Trinity]] itself as if it were a god of its own, and bear witness to some manifestation of it.\n\nIt is worth noting that not only priests and other clergy form these connections. Any being of any background can form these connections, given the right circumstances.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.849233784Z","tags":null},"/Observum":{"title":"Observum","content":"[[The University]]'s institution regarding the study of [[Gods]], their power channeled through the will of [[Observance]], and their relationship to [[Zol]].

However, people will be people, and their beliefs and biases always find a way to manifest. The [[Observum]] is no stranger to heated debate, crossed lines, and difficult conversations. However it is from these challenging discussions the school derives new philosophy and understanding.

Typically accompanied by a cast of creatures in the same, but smaller form as he.\n\n## Symbolism\nDenoted by a symbol of a manta ray with a sun on its back.\n\n## Behavior\nOhlit pays mortals little mind compared to other [[Zolaen Gods]]. He focuses primarily on the defense of [[Zol]] from the dangers of [[The Void]], but does maintain the natural order of the sea. A place where mortals can find sustenance and a shore to make homes upon, but also maintains a level of danger to keep mortals in check, and a safe distance away from [[The Void]].\n\n## Realm\n[[Ohlit]] resides in [[The Immortal Ocean]], a plane of endless sea life.\n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of [[Ohlit]] live in costal regions and pay sacrifice and worship to the sea for good fortune and guidance.

This is because those of [[The Void]] seek to return [[Zol]] to its primordial form known as the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The Ocean itself was created by [[Ohlit]] as a border between [[Zol]] and [[The Void]]. \n\nAt the greatest depths of [[Zol]] exists fissures that lead into [[The Void]]. The Ocean covers many of these fissures and allows [[Ohlit]] to monitor anything that may try to bridge the gap between worlds.\n\nThe Sea-God sends armies of his creation to war against [[The Void]] in an endless effort to hold back the evils that lurk deep beneath [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.852233799Z","tags":null},"/Old-Zol":{"title":"Old Zol","content":"The highly advanced civilization of [[Zol]] that existed in [[The Before]].

A product of thousands upon thousands of worlds cultivated, and consumed like livestock. Worlds made to sustain cosmic beings called the [[Great Old Ones]]. Amongst these cultivated worlds, one grew strong enough to fight back, and imprison its creator in [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. \n\nThe being's name was [[Goh'zul]]. In his prison, the Great Old One was forced to slowly starve and rot away. As he did, his body attracted a myriad of creatures from all across the cosmic sea. They gorged on his infinite body for eons, forming The [[Sea of Monsters]]. Many of the beings who partook in the flesh of the decaying god gradually developed deformed physical characteristics, devolving into horrible, and extremely powerful creatures. \n\nAt the core of the writhing sea, was the once core of the Great Old One. A heart of black stone called [[Oblivion]], home to The Great Old One's Soul. A remnant of the ancient being called [[The Wretch]]. Since the defeat and imprisonment of the Great Old One, it had become the site of an everlasting duel. A fight between The Wretch, and the first being he ever consumed.\n\nWhen [[Goh'zul]] fell from power, the consumed individual swore an oath to never let the creature return to its true strength. He guarded the sole door to the heart of The Great Old One, fighting tooth and nail, to prevent the escape of [[The Wretch]]. Declaring himself [[The Watcher in The Door]].\n\nAfter an age of fighting, The Watcher had reached his limit, in a final attempt at securing his victory, he wounded the immortal Wretch, so gravely it could do not but flee and hide in the dark corners of its prison. In this victory, The Watcher left [[Oblivion]], and took a new approach to his oath.\n\nHe made demands of the sea, speaking a new language called [[The First Tongue]]. His divine words struck order to the chaos. The Watcher called forth the bravest and greatest creatures, who still held onto a fragment of their past dignity. He cured them of their monstrosity, and in thanks they became his pantheon. Together they became the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\nThe [[Zolaen Gods]] bent the sea of monsters to their will by speaking this new holy language, [[The First Tongue]]. In shaping the new world, they bound the infinite power that laid inside the Great Old One into a force called [[The Trinity]]. A designed paradise that would have been a land of endless prosperity. However [[The Wretch]], had one final strike to lay upon his foe. \n\nFrom the confines of his prison, it whispered a dark tongue of his own. It's speech poured from the unguarded door, a weak and dying sound in comparison to the chorus of creation sung by the [[Zolaen Gods]]. The primal power clung to the words of the new gods, twisting them at their corners, and weaving darkness into the new world. This act left [[The Wretch]] as a husk, but its poison would live on outside, in the newly birthed world of [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.853233805Z","tags":null},"/Outer-Villages":{"title":"Outer Villages","content":"An outer village is a small satellite community that is under the jurisdiction of a nearby city.

The members of these communities are typically seen as the peasants, serfs or other sorts of lowly commoners all about [[Zol]]. Both types of outer-city communities are usually the first to feel the wrath of warfare when it finds a city. Additionally, since there is no physical barrier stopping bandits and monsters from entering, these communities often find themselves at the mercy of these dangers.\n\nAnother related concept is [[Estates]] which are walled properties of land outside of the city, usually owned by the rich.

It is the westmost city in all [[The Three Corners]].\n\n![[penthe.png]]\n\nA powerful pump constructed using [[Imbuement Perpetuum]] moves water up from the Se'dir River to the city's highest point, where it then flows back down through constructed canals and waterfalls all throughout the area.

For those who are in the city's favor it is one of the safest places within [[Zol]]. |\n| Main Challenge | The city worships the [[Zolaen Gods]] to a degree that is borderline fanatical, this stems from the city's history and its association with [[The First Bastion]]. In its current society these shared beliefs create a community for those who hold them, but drives away anything else. Non-believers, sinners, or those who do not devote themselves well enough are shunned as outsiders. Myth and rumor paints a darker image where these outsiders are not only shunned, but culled. However there is little proof of this, and would depend heavily on the religious-political state of the city's leadership. |\n| Climate | Temperate/Dry |\n| Cuisine | Cultivated Fruits, Farmed Goods, Flatbread and rice based meals |\n| Export | Military Training |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| Some |\n| City Leader | High Lord Draezus Wolf |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | River valley, Inner-city canals and waterfalls |\n| Architecture | Very tall buildings, Archways, Banners, Stained-glass windows |\n| Color(s) | Purple, Grey, and Blue |\n| Symbolism | A vertical, point-down sword with an overarching curve from the far left of the hilt that goes up over the pommel and ends at the far right of the hilt.

The city has the one of the lowest percentages of uncared for citizens in all of [[Zol]] due to the resources provided by the churches and [[The First Bastion]] |\n| Nobility | Social Class | The cities upper-crust. Most of which sponsor the churches and [[The First Bastion]] by means of economic resources, or other types of power. |\n| The Misfortuned | Social Class | The lowest economic level of the city. Not quite beggars as those without are generally taken care of by the church, save for those deeply shunned. |\n| The Shunned | Non Zolaen-Centric/Secular Group | Citizens who do not fit the ideals of the church. Members of society who are outcast by others for things like differing beliefs, partial devotion, or sins. Those who are shunned by the masses are rarely welcomed back into their previous circles. Even those close to one who has been deemed an outsider will be treated differently. |\n| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |\n| The Devout | Religious (Zolaen-Centric) Group | Citizens who follow the Zolaen-Centric beliefs of the church very closely, or at least appear to from the outside view. This group makes up the vast majority of the population. |\n| Clergy | Religious group | Those who make a career of performing work for the church, or the more clerical aspects of [[The First Bastion]] |\n| [[The First Bastion]] | Military/Religious Guild | A devout, Zolaen-Centric group of trained warriors who fight under the banner of [[Laenwalde]] as the kingdom's most skilled warriors. Helmed by Blade Lord Kive Bidell. The institution's aim is to train powerful warriors and clerics to defend and uphold the kingdom and the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. The guild exists as a branch of the [[Observum]] under the umbrella of [[The University]]. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Cliffkeep | Keep | The city's keep, located on a large rock outcropping on the valley's southern slope. |\n | Penthe Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Penthe Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle, located on the grounds of Cliffkeep |\n | Bastion Convergence | Teleportation Circle | [[The First Bastion]]'s teleportation circle |\n | Highsquare | Market | The city's nicest market for the wealthiest individuals. Located next to Cliff keep at the city's highest peak upon its horn-shaped outcropping. It is also the location of the pump which sends water flowing down all through out the city |\n | The Ivy Markets | Market | The city's more common markets. The various markets, divided by good sold are located within Ivy Gate |\n | Iyowne's Pressing | Tavern | A tavern frequented by the nobility of the city. Said to be located nearest to the visitation point of the angel Iyowne |\n | Khalborit's Alehouse | Tavern | An Alehouse popular with Devout commoners of the city. Located within Smokepole |\n | Cottonheath Inn | Tavern | A small and dingy inn, frequented by the shunned member's of the city's society. Music and conversation does not frequent this place like the other taverns of the city. Located at the rivers edge in Cottonheath. |\n | [[The First Bastion]] | Guild | A valiant structure of golden, swirling adornment detailing and white stone. Located at the center of Victory. A branch of The [[Observum]]. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is under rule of High Lord Draezus Wolf and his council. The city is known for respecting the crown of [[Laenwalde]] so truly and honorably, there are rhymes and jokes written about it.\n\nSecond to the High Lord, is Blade Lord Kive Bidell. The Blade Lord is leader of [[The First Bastion]]. The Blade Lord responds only to the command of High Lords and the King himself.\n\nBeyond that, rank within the church is just as seriously as government rank. If a priest were to command something of you, it would be the same as if an officer were to. However you would have no *legal* precedent to follow it, just a serious societal one.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, much of [[The University]]'s operations concerning the [[Observum]] occur within the city. [[The First Bastion]] focuses much of its resources on training adept fighters to venture out into [[Laenwalde]] and the world beyond to act on behalf of the King and the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nWhen the city was originally founded by [[The Undari]], it was a place where martial skill was of great cultural importance. This ideal has transformed over time along with teaching of Zolaen-Centric beliefs to form a very devout people.\n\nSo devout, it garnered the attention of Iyowne, a powerful angel of [[The Watcher]]. In the late [[First Age]], the angel visited the city during sunset. He spoke well of the peoples devotion, and told them their city exemplified the ideals [[The Watcher]] aimed to instill all across [[Zol]]. Those who witnessed Iyowne were granted high station within the church.\n\nWhile some doubt the event ever taking place, its effect in the city's culture has remained strong event to modern day. The people of [[Penthe]] conserve old beliefs in an aim to stay true in the eyes of the [[Gods]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The people of the city depend very little upon [[Apparatum]] and other magical objects. This is due to a widely held belief that those sorts of proclivities are not needed when one is cared for by the gods. Many generations ago they were outlawed, but convenience and abundance has eroded away those principals. Now most commoners will use them when necessary, and nobility tend to employ whatever they deem fit. The secondary effect to this is it is difficult to purchase things of this nature in the city. One is better of catching a train to [[Ryze]].\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.857233825Z","tags":null},"/Persanius":{"title":"Persanius","content":"*Wandering God, Moral of Compassion*\n![[Persanius.png]]\n\nIn one's creation, we see a whole world that exists only within them. A world worth protecting. [[Persanius]] is said to be a being creation. His scripture speaks of him making both art and machine in an attempt to better understand the universe itself. He teaches the moral of Compassion. In his scripture it is said beyond ones self, an individual acts and experiences the world through the tools and artistry. Tools and art are product of people, when one learns to view the world through this precise lens wisdom like no other can be found.\n\n## Depiction\nSaid to appear as an aged human man with a bald head and a long grey beard. Some depict him as wearing armor that is said to appear as if it was painted on reality itself, while others believe that his armor and tools are a swarm of tiny machines that assemble themselves in infinite configurations at his will, some even depict him as having a missive set of butterfly wings. He is also said to wear an array of rings on his hands.\n\n## Moral\n[[Persanius]] teaches the moral of Compassion. The wisdom of understanding another hardship, and treating them with kindness in turn. To find and understand ones darkness is a great challenge, and filling that void with light even more so. Overcoming this challenge can effect the world of [[Sapient Beings]] with immeasurable benefit. \n\n## Associations\n[[Persanius]] is associated with:\n- Academia\n- [[Artificers]]\n- Art\n\n## Realm\n[[Persanius]] is said to reside within a grand strange machine within [[The Unknown Realm]]. It is a sprawling and strange structure of an unknown purpose.\n\n## Behavior\n[[Persanius]] has a reputation of maintaining an impassive demeanor. Never raising his voice, or exercising wrath. He aims to maintain that action is carried out compassionately. If an individual is cruel, he teaches the asking of questions like: can that cruelty be understood, and maybe even overcome? He is known to interact with those who are already very compassionate, or could use a compassionate influence in their life.\n\n## Worshipers\nThose who follow [[Persanius]] are know to be very thoughtful individuals, and are often pacifists. They seek not to avoid conflict, but circumvent it. Within [[Persanius]]' scripture it is clearly written that violence itself is not evil, but it is the final choice. Those who follow his message carry this very closely to heart.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.857233825Z","tags":null},"/Pheridian":{"title":"Pheridian","content":"*Ensharden Nedrahsne*\n![[Pheridian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Pheridian]] belief is often defined by some as an [[Obscuran]] religion. While true by some definitions, [[Pheridian]] belief is one of the larges religious denominations that is not a Zolaen-Centric, or Trinity-Centric belief system. It is based in worship of [[The Oldshards]]. Two ancient and mysterious relics with magical properties like nothing else. [[The Apex]] and [[The Vertex]]. [[Pheridian]] belief sees [[The Oldshards]] as perfect objects. Two things which strike order amongst the chaos of [[Zol]].\n\nThe true nature of [[The Oldshards]] is not known, but it is written in [[Pheridian]] scripture that they were once understood by Pre-Undoing [[Changelings]]. [[Pheridian]] belief idealizes the concept of rediscovering [[The Oldshards]]. Only through this understanding can order be made of a chaotic world.\n\n## Values\n- [[The Oldshards]]\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n- [[Changelings]]\n- [[The Pattern]]\n- [[Pure Form]]\n- Pure Voice\n- [[True Form]]\n- [[Shardcallers]]\n- Singing\n- [[Form Art]]\n- Symmetry\n- Perfection\n- Order\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Oldshards]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\n[[Pheridian]] scripture believes that [[Goh'zul]], while destructive and terrible, was a collector of great things. He would scour the cosmos, accumulating pieces of the universe within himself. These things swirled within his infinite form. Together they blended and merged into a wonderous, and chaotic mess. The world of [[Zol]]. This interaction within [[Goh'zul]]'s body killed him, but [[Zol]] grew from his remains.\n\n[[Goh'zul]] collected many things. Forces, [[Gods]], and objects of immense power. Each one a marvel in its own right. However, only 2 objects stood out as perfect. [[The Oldshards]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Pheridian]] scripture tells of ancient people being advanced and peaceful. [[Pheridian]] belief rejects the theory of the [[Triumvirate]]. It is thought that ancient [[Changelings]] had a comprehensive understanding of [[The Oldshards]] before [[The Undoing]].\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Pheridian]] scripture does not give a cause for [[The Undoing]]. It actually claims that attempting to infer that information is heretical. It instead believes that the true cause of [[The Undoing]] is information that is actually stored within [[The Oldshards]]. It is only to be known when that information is dispensed by them.\n\n## Church Structure\nThe church within [[Pheridian]] belief are unique as they also serve as places of education. It is an organization known as [[The Eelynn]]. Leading these organizations is handled by **Shardwitnesses**. **Shardwitnesses** are much more than just clergy within [[The Glassius Reach]], as they are also scholars, politicians, tacticians, and things of the like. However, some **Shardwitnesses** bear the responsibility of leading their people in faith. They do bear a hierarchy within [[The Eelynn]], however there are not titles associated with rank. All leaders are simply known as **Shardwitnesses**, but rank is a carefully determined structure done based on the individuals within the organization.\n\nEach Glassian city has its own manifestation of [[The Eelynn]], with its own organizational structure.\n\n### Notable Organizations\n- [[The Eelynn]]\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief focuses on the idea living ones life in an orderly way. Each person's life has its own unique shape and the process of strengthening one's faith involves finding how that shape fits into [[The Pattern]]. Modernist belief sees [[The Pattern]] as more of a suggestion rather than a set of distinct rules.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief consists of very strict adherence to [[The Pattern]]. It is believed by these individuals that more information about [[The Oldshards]] can only be found through devotion to [[The Pattern]]. Straying from [[The Pattern]] is a sin in the eyes of a Fundamentalist.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Pheridian]] religion was significantly harmed during the [[Western War]] when [[The Apex]] was lost. This has caused much uproar within [[Pheridian]] belief and the effects are still at the core of this great loss.\n- [[Pheridian]] belief sees other [[Gods]] merely as powerful entities, not divinity. They are to be respected, but not worshiped.\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- [[The Eelynn]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.85823383Z","tags":null},"/Phlogiston":{"title":"Phlogiston","content":"See [[Alchemy]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.86023384Z","tags":null},"/Pirates":{"title":"Pirates","content":"Those who ascribe to the lawless nature of the seas.

A plane which contains many other planes all anchored to a [[Prime Material Plane]]. The sheer number of planes in [[Zol]] is not known. Planar travel poses many challenges, and most mortals know little of anything outside the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Despite this, the powerful and arcane citizens of [[Zol]] have recorded a fair deal about the [[Planes]].\n\n![[Diagram of the cosmos.png]]\n\n[[Planes]] were first created from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. [[The Watcher]] did not transform the majority of the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]], but did manage to harness a great deal of it. What is left of the [[Sea of Monsters]] is now known as [[The Void]].\n\nAll planes in [[Zol]] are are anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]], which is the resting place of [[The Trinity]], and home to [[The Three Corners of Civilization]].\n\nAll planes float amongst [[The Ethos]], the local section of the universe that stops at [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Beyond that lies [[The Cosmos]] which spans on forever.\n\n## List of All Planes\nThere are many planes in [[Zol]]. Below is the list of known major planes.\n- **The Mortal Planes** - Planes bound by the rule of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[Prime Material Plane]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Zol]] and resting place of [[The Trinity]]. Being the source of all magical power, and the anchor for all other planes, it is the focal point for all of [[Zol]]. Often referred to as the anchor realm.\n\t- [[Fey]]\n\t\t- A fantastical reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where nature an beauty run rampant. While enticing, the [[Fey]] is very dangerous.\n\t- [[Fell]]\n\t\t- A dark and mysterious reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where shadows and thorns grow from a hauntingly beautiful, and extremely dangerous landscape.\n\t- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\t\t- The fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], where the elemental forces of nature stop overlapping one another. Appearing on diagrams like the drawing of a child who has colored outside of the lines. [[The Elemental Planes]] jut out of the [[Prime Material Plane]] creating worlds that solely embody a single aspect of nature. They are strange realms rarely traversed by foreigners.\n\t- - [[The Moons]]\n\t\t- A group of ancient planets that once existed freely in [[The Cosmos]], but were consumed by [[Goh'zul]]. Before he could fully digest them, he was defeated. Leaving a set of strange ruined worlds that orbit one another in [[Zol]]'s sky.\n\t\t- [[The Forgotten Heavens]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Moons]]. The once abandoned divine plane attached to these ancient worlds. Now inhabited by [[The Night Empress]] and her court. **This plane itself is not on the mortal coil.**\n- **The Outer Planes** - Planes that are not bound by [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]\n\t\t- The Castle of [[The Watcher]] and his close allies\n\t- [[The Palace of Drole]]\n\t\t- An endless palace inhabited by [[Yanneran]] and his chosen dead. A place of constant celebration and art.\n\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t- Where the fateless dead are sent by [[The Coilwalker]] to have their future determined.\n\t- [[Absurdia]]\n\t\t- One of the most bizarre aspects of [[Zol]]. It is described as a sort of parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Its inhabitants are very odd, and those that travel to it tell tales of strange events that almost sound like comical children's stories mixed with accounts of great violence.\n\t- [[The Unknown Realm]]\n\t\t- The home of [[The Wandering Gods]]\n\t- [[The Immortal Ocean]]\n\t\t- A realm of only water and light, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant. Accessible only to those who are not invited by its ruler [[Ohlit]].\n\t- [[The Pure Forest]]\n\t\t- A beautiful infinitely spanning forest brought into existence by [[The Lifeweaver]]'s presence, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant.\n\t- [[Elm Manor]]\n\t\t- The artificial plane constructed by [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].\n\t- [[The Storm Horizon]]\n\t\t- The origin of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s storms.\n- **Unique Planar Manifestations** - Planes, or things very similar to planes, that have their own set of rules that is unique to them.\n\t- [[The Void]]\n\t\t- The Remnants of the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The size and scope of [[The Void]] is not know by even the [[Gods]]. It exists directly underneath the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It contains evils incomprehensible to mortals, and is only held back by the efforts of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t\t- [[Damnation]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Void]]. It is an amalgamation of all hells ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], and is ruled by the terrifying demon [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is accessible in the deepest darkest caverns that span at the bottom of [[The Underdark]].\n\t- [[The Ethos]]\n\t\t- The space that surrounds all of [[Zol]]'s planes. It is essentially the lack of a plane. The whole universe exists floats amongst this manifestation of reality, [[The Ethos]] is merely the local section of it.\n\t\t- [[The Ethos]] is also bound by [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- [[The Cosmos]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Ethos]] and [[The Great Wall of Roots]].\n\t- [[The Ethereal Plane]]\n\t\t- Not truly a plane at all. Some call it The Cognitive Realm, others call it The Plane of Souls. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is the wavelength of reality that souls exist on. It overlaps all of [[Zol]]. It is possible to interface directly with [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even travel through it.\n\t- [[Oblivion]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Goh'zul]]. Little is known about [[Oblivion]]. Scripture talks of it being the battle ground between [[The Watcher]] and [[The Wretch]]. It is said to have a sole entrance called simply *The Door*, and is thought to still contain what little is left of [[Goh'zul]].\n\t- [[The Space Outside Reality]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Cosmos]]. Also known as The Far Realm.\n\n## Subplanes\nSubplanes are planes that are created within another plane. They inherit all the rules their parent plane subscribes to.\n\nExample: [[Artificers]] create the common [[Apparatum]] known as a Bag of Holding. This device is a fabric sac that contains a portal to an artificial plane that merely contains space for storing objects. If this Bag of Holding is brought to the [[Prime Material Plane]] the space inside the bag is bound to [[The Mortal Coil]], if it is brought to [[Absurdia]] it is not.\n\n## The Two Types of Planes: Planets and Realms\nA planet is a discrete, usually spherical plane that floats freely amongst [[The Cosmos]]. [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] are a good example of this. Planets typically have some central point of gravity that keeps objects on its surface. Planets do not usually have other planes bound to them in any way other than gravitational orbit of other planets.\n\nRealms are planes that are not necessarily discrete and do not have to subscribe to Euclidean Geometry. They may be infinite, repeating/fractal, or end abruptly at their edges.\n\nIn [[The Cosmos]], Parent realms are usually discerned by some sort of barrier between them and the rest of the universe. They typically contain many lesser planes bound to a [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as their own local section of [[The Cosmos]] similar to [[The Ethos]]. \n\nAs an example: [[Zol]] is the parent realm, [[The Prime]] is the anchor realm, as the majority of planes within [[Zol]] are directly bound to it. Its barrier is [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. The local part of the universe within that barrier is known as [[The Ethos]].\n\nPlanets can exist on their own or within a realm. Realms are rarely contained by a planet, but Realms usually contain other realms.\n\n## Artificial Planes\nPlanes that are not found already existing in [[Zol]] are called Artificial Planes. They are newly created, and typically temporary in the cosmic scale.\n\nThey can manifest at any size and can be produced intentionally or by wild magic. The can exist as planets or realms.\n\nConstructing a plane intentionally is very difficult and requires immense skill. The size, specifications, and permanency of the plane depends on the ability of the creator.\n\nA good example of this is the plane of [[Elm Manor]], home to [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].

These individuals are considered of the highest social class. |\n| Rail Merchants | Social class | Individuals who manage the business side of the rail trade. Writing invoices for repair, purchasing and selling raw material, and selling rail cars. These individuals belong to the middle and high class depending on their success. |\n| The Iron Union | Workers Guild | The largest workers guild. Largely known to be backed by The Iron Mob.

It runs an educational institution for the purpose of training those who wish to enter the rail trade. While smaller in size this guild is quite influential as all conductors of [[The Iron Tracks]] are members to it. Known to be backed by the Volden Mob. |\n| The Iron Mob | Criminal | Headed by Paros Dalth, a mean, no nonsense human man. This mob frequently employs members of the guild it backs, The Iron Union. This gives them the largest number of goons out of all the major mobs. |\n| The Dragonkin Mob | Criminal | Headed by Astos Belkan, a proud and well dressed dragonborn man. This mob is the richest of its peers due to its backing of The Merchants Guild, giving them the highest quality of resources. |\n| The Volden Mob | Criminal | Headed by Vellen Volden, a seemingly scatterbrained and silly artificer who is swift and brutal when it comes to running her mob. This mob has the most loyal and almost cult-like following as many members of its backed institution, The Rail-workers Academy are recruited into the mob during their education. |\n| Small-time Mobs | Criminal | Around 2 dozen mobs of varying sizes that frequently rise and fall similar to a feudal system. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Brick Keep | Keep | They city's keep |\n | Rails Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle |\n | Rails Station | Train Station | The city's train station.

A tall and proud human woman, fairly young for an [[Alderian Seat]]. She, her nobility, and her garrison keep a general appearance of order to the city, despite the heavy mob presence. This is because the mobs themselves hold each other at knifepoint. \n\nSoon after the origin of [[The Iron Tracks]], crime surged in the city. This continued for a few decades of chaos as profitability of [[The Iron Tracks]] grew. Eventually it reached a point where some criminal organizations that backed legitimate trade were able to become wealthy. Enough so that they were able to dig in with a sense of permanency and order.\n\nWhen this occurred bloodshed between mobs and the garrison changed from frequent, chaotic and brutal, to well-planned, swift, and impactful events. Mobs have to tread carefully as to not being wars between them. This makes Rails a strangely ordered city, despite the massive criminal network.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Rails]] is [[Zol]]'s eastern hub of all things related to [[The Iron Tracks]]. This is because the original development of the tracks began within this city. It became a hub of skill, and commerce for the trade. Other city's attempted to begin their own versions of this trade, but nearly all merchants and craftsmen all flocked to [[Rails]] as it was much more profitable. The only other comparable city is the western city of [[Ryze]] in [[Laenwalde]].\n\nThis pattern over time has developed a methodology for [[Trains]]. All planned routes of trains over time are planned to pass through [[Rails]] and [[Ryze]]. When they arrive maintenance and improvements are done before they are sent on another planned route. Because of this, if a train car has an issue far from one of the cities, it is usually abandoned.\n\nSince most land based shipping occurs via train, [[Rails]] is also a hub for criminal smuggling.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThey city's name *Rails* was originally pronounced *Ra-ee-liss*, but after the creation of [[The Iron Tracks]], foreigners mispronounced the name due to the rails which [[Trains]] move upon. The misattributed name sake stuck.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.86423386Z","tags":null},"/Ralatas-Prince-of-Beasts":{"title":"Ralatas, Prince of Beasts","content":"*Wayward God of Beasts and the Hunt, Major Deity*\n![[Ralatas prince of beasts.png]]\n\nLord of the forest, god of claw and fang, master of the hunt. Ralatas the prince of beast reigns as the powerful overseer of the harsh wilds, and those who make a home in it.\n\nTaking his throne from his father, Ralatas is the successor of the mad [[Kerndall, the Feral King]].\n\n## Depiction\nRalatas is depicted as an elegant beast, adorned in a floral crown. Most famously taking the form of a massive wolf, Ralatas is also know to be seen as a god-like form of any beast.\n\n## Symbolism\nA single fang with three dots arranged in a triangle.\n\n## Behavior\nRalatas is known for maintaining the natural chaos that nature provides. A place without the laws and the systems of mortals. He seeks to keep as much of [[Zol]] as he can unbound, allowing the natural laws of nature to unfold.\n\nIs known to be amicable to [[The Lifeweaver]].\n\n## Realm\nResides in [[The Pure Forest]], the same realm as [[The Lifeweaver]]. Ralatas is known to spend much of his time in a rock formation and series of caves that resembles a castle some-what. \n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of Ralatas are usually mystics, druids, tribes, and other social oddities. Formal worship is not practiced. Relations with Ralatas manifest more as a way of life involving hunts, and spending most of ones time in the natural world.\n\n## State of Princedom\nRalatas succeeded his father [[Kerndall]] when the once king attempted to expand his domain by converting society to beasts. He did so by accidentally manufacturing a disease called [[Beast Ire]]. A condition that caused madness and mutations. Converting mortals into feral beasts who hunted their own kin. Devouring hundreds and spreading the disease to others.\n\nThe disease eventually mutated in such a way where it could infect beasts as well. Causing them to take on horrifying forms. [[Kerndall]] was forced to contain the ailment within himself to save [[Zol]]. Maddening him and turning him into a horrible monster now under the control of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\nRalatas will not take the title of king until his father has been slain.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.865233865Z","tags":null},"/Rali-Trunsarr":{"title":"Rali Trunsarr","content":"See [[The Paige of Cups]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.865233865Z","tags":null},"/Reach-Run":{"title":"Reach Run","content":"*The Vibrant City of [[Aarakocra]]*\n![[Reach Run skyline.png]]\n\nAbove the costal city of [[Reach Run]], a sky filled with airships, hot air balloons, and flying [[Aarakocra]].

Since the city attracts nearly everyone on the road, good or bad, the unfortunate meetings that many have with things like criminals sometimes extend to personal encounters as well. There seems to almost be some magical influence on the city that causes people to bump into individuals they know, often it is friends, but sometimes it is foes. | \n| Climate                  |

Since the city is vertically distributed, those who do not have a means of flight require some service to move about the complex city. Cabbies graciously fill this role by carrying people or parcels to their destination. Typically, cabbies will lift a large wicker carriage, called a *cab*, capable of moving one or more people to their desired location. A strong cabbie can move one or two individuals on their own given they are of modest weight, or sometimes they work in teams to move heavier loads. Most cabbies are [[Aarakocra]], but the role can be filled by anyone who can fly. Be it by natural, magical, or mechanical means.

A proud Aarakocran Noble of long standing lineage. House Gaalokria has been in the seat of leadership within [[Reach Run]] for many generations.

However since High Lord Gerrian Gaalokria IV has taken the throne, the disorderly nature of the city has nearly doubled.\n\nHigh Lord Gerrian Gaalokria IV is not loved by his citizens. He is infamous for allowing the city to proceed in a disorderly manner. His rule is often summed up with one of his quotes: *\"Ruling Reach Run is like plumbing a house. Some pipes are for clean water, some are for shit. In a perfect world we wouldn't need the latter; hell we wouldn't even need the first. This isn't a perfect world, we need both pipes, and you have to let them flow in their own way or they get clogged.\"*\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn the current day and age, the city is the hub for aeronautical craft, repair and trade.

Strange friends and enemies were made between Dwarf, Elf, and Human during this period.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Within [[Reach Run]] there is a very popular and unique sport called [[Flaunt]].\n- The people of [[Reach Run]] steer clear of [[The East Mounts]], buying in on the folktales and rumors of a cursed mountain range\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.871233896Z","tags":null},"/Religion":{"title":"Religion","content":"In [[Zol]] religion provides safety, power and information. The presence of the [[Gods]] is very well known, but their methods, intentions, and origins are largely a mystery.\n\nReligion in Zol takes many forms. Some undergo their practice as an individual journey, or participate in one of the many [[Religious Denominations]]. There many churches, sects, cults, traditions, and practices. All with their own unique belief systems to make sense of the complex world of [[Zol]] and its mysterious [[Gods]].\n\n## Major Beliefs\nThere is a vast number of perspectives from which [[Zol]] and its [[Gods]] are understood. Most of which can be summarized by these 6 categories. Ordered from most common to least common:\n\n- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 45% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[Zolaen Gods]] created [[Zol]] and are the true and holy rulers of it. This belief system also subscribes to the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are malicious, or at the very least not to be trusted. This is because Zolaen-Centric belief blames [[The Undoing]] on the [[Zolaen Gods]]. It also entails that the [[Wayward Gods]] are dangerous and not to be trusted due to their chaotic nature.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship one or many of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Regardless of their specific method of worship, it is generally thought that one should pay respect and worship to all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] from time-to-time.\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with, or rather an extension of, the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t- Shares some beliefs with Trinity-Centric religions\n\t- [[Religious Denominations]]\n\t\t- [[Arkian]]\n\t\t- [[Dorian]]\n\n- ### Trinity-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 25% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based in the general idea that the pantheons of [[Gods]] are not the true ultimate power. They instead believe that [[The Trinity]] itself is the only thing deserving of worship. In this system, the [[Gods]] are either mere extensions of [[The Trinity]], or false gods who stray the light of [[The Trinity]]. This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Anti-Trinity]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship [[The Trinity]] as a whole or some specific manifestation of it. Like the [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[The Trinity]].\n\t- Shares some beliefs with Zolaen-Centric religions\n\t- [[Religious Denominations]]\n\t\t- [[Trinaism]]\n\t\t- [[Ashian]]\n\n- ### Monotheism or Polytheism\n\t- *Roughly 10% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system recognizes each god as an individual being, and does not judge them based on their pantheon. Followers of this belief typically focus on a single god, or small group of gods based on the individuals selection. This system typically operates under the assumption that [[The Undoing]] was caused by the [[Gods]], but it is not know which gods. So judgement is not cast.\n\n- ### Exaltation Obscura\n\t- *Roughly 7% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system operates consolidates all beliefs that do not subscribe to any other system. This may be the worship of some obscure force that is not understood by [[Zol]] or something of the like. Examples of this are:\n\t\t- [[The Hum]]\n\t\t- [[The Oldshards]]\n\t\t- Cosmic beings such as the [[Great Old Ones]]\n\t\t- The [[Wayward Gods]]\n\t- [[Religious Denominations]]\n\t\t- [[Obscuran]]\n\t\t- [[Zephyrean]]\n\t\t- [[Pheridian]]\n\n- ### Wanderer-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 6% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are more of guardians rather than [[Gods]]. They are thought to have come to [[Zol]] to protect civilization from the unchecked power of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. As per this belief system, [[The Undoing]] is seen as the fault of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Those who subscribe to this theory also believe that the [[Wayward Gods]] and [[Wordbearers]] are not all inherently bad.\n\t- Followers of this belief see [[The Wandering Gods]] more as mentors rather than omnipotent rulers, guiding them in their struggles.\n\t- [[Religious Denominations]]\n\t\t- [[Wanderian]]\n\n- ### Atheism\n\t- *Roughly 6% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system operates based on the assumption that mortals need not revere [[Gods]], as they are merely beings. Their power does not make them holy, only more present in [[Zol]]. The specific ideas differ from person to person, but largely revolves around skepticism towards information about the gods divined through worship.\n\n- ### Void Worship\n\t- *Less than 1% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea of sacrifice in exchange for power from the [[Void Gods]]. A taboo practice in all of society, this belief is a dangerous and dark practice. Individuals who practice this faith are known for having twisted world views.\n\t- [[Religious Denominations]]\n\t\t- [[Malevolan]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.871233896Z","tags":null},"/Religious-Denominations":{"title":"Religious Denominations","content":"[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] is a complex thing. There are many religious and philosophical belief systems in [[Zol]] that all have their own unique perspective of the world. These denominations and organizations differ wildly in belief, size, and values.\n\nDenominations are blanket terms used to encapsulate large and complex belief systems. Individuals who consider themselves part of one of these denominations will have their own unique interpretation of their specific faith. This means that there are many variations and interpretations of the belief systems described here. However, these denominations give a good overview of the beliefs held across [[Zol]]. \n\n# The Three Corners of Civilization\n## Major Religious Denominations\n- Trinity-Centric Belief\n\t- [[Trinaism]] - The belief that we are all one with [[The Trinity]], and this connection to all things should be treated as sacred. They believe that [[The Undoing]] was caused by imbalance, and lack of unity across the world.\n\t- [[Ashian]] - The belief that [[The Shroud of the Void]] caused [[The Undoing]] and the people of [[Zol]] lost their connection to [[The Trinity]] during this destruction. It can only be restored through understanding and worship. It is also known for its high regard for [[The First Tongue]], specifically the reverence of [[Wordbearers]]. Most notably, [[The Word of Fire]].\n- Zolaen-Centric Belief\n\t- [[Arkian]] - The belief that [[The Undoing]] was caused by straying from the [[Gods]], and that Zol can only be restored in their light.\n\t- [[Dorian]] - The belief that the [[Gods]] have given the people of [[The Three Corners]] a second chance through [[The Undoing]]. They believe that regardless of what caused [[The Undoing]], creating a better world is the only path forward.\n- Wanderer-Centric\n\t- [[Wanderian]] - The belief that [[The Undoing]] was caused by discourse amongst the [[Gods]]. They believe that the world can only be restored through wisdom and shared responsibility.\n- Exaltation Obscura\n\t- [[Pheridian]] - The belief that [[The Oldshards]] are perfect objects, conduits of the greatest parts of reality. Holiness is only found through ones harmonization with [[The Oldshards]]. A task most commonly accomplished by adherence to [[The Pattern]].\n\t- [[Zephyrean]] - The belief that  [[The Undoing]] was only one of many great dangers that exist within [[Zol]]. Safety and salvation can only be found in strength and purpose.\n\t- [[Obscuran]] - The blanket term used to describe the minority groups who worship the various [[Wayward Gods]], and other mysterious forces.\n- Void Worship\n\t- [[Malevolan]] - The blanket term used to describe the minority groups who worship the various [[Void Gods]] and other dark forces.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.872233901Z","tags":null},"/Rello-Arr":{"title":"Rello Arr","content":"A [[Kapesh]] city destroyed in the peak of the [[Triumvirate Battles]].

A hole in armor reforms in a few days, a wheel on a cart is round again in a week, and a shattered sword can be pieced back together with care. This makes for a very desirable material. It was harvested extensively during the [[First Age]]. Its veins would slowly restore themselves, but be quickly remined. This made for little of the resource in the ground, but a slow drip of profit from what was found.\n\nWhen [[Iron Light]] was discovered, the value of [[Rift Iron]] skyrocketed. However, its slow regrowth made it difficult to get. On top of that, once [[Rift Iron]] is tempered, you cannot change its shape, making any material already used useless for [[Artificers]].\n\n*For more lore read [[Weaving - Desperate People]]*","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.872233901Z","tags":null},"/Rift-Lung":{"title":"Rift Lung","content":"See [[Rift Smog]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.872233901Z","tags":null},"/Rift-Smog":{"title":"Rift Smog","content":"A toxic off-gas produced by the regrowth of [[Rift Iron]].

Many sailors from all over [[The Narrow Sea]] and [[The Archsea]] frequent this city. |\n| Main Challenge | The city has changed hands between [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]] many of times. Due to this, the city is full of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. The vast majority of these people do not like each other. Eastern [[Riverbridge]] being the territory of the [[Humans]], and the west going to the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. |\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Fish, Imported Foods, Farmed Goods, Rum |\n| Export | Fish, Ships |\n| Size | Large |\n| Outer Villages| Few |\n| City Leader | Lady Trell Gallan  |\n| Primary Language(s) | Human, Elvish, and Dwarvish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Humans, Elves, and Dwarves |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Trinity-Centric, Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Island City, Great Bridges, Costal |\n| Architecture | Cycladic, Arches |\n| Color(s) | Black and Gold |\n| Symbolism | A vertical sword with a bridge spanning from either side |\n| Defenses | Naval Fleet, City Garrison |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | Those charged by the crown with running the city, or successful business owners. |\n| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work. Be it because of health issues, mental state, addiction, or some other personal reason. These individuals are extremely poor and are occasional persecuted for their begging and made to be slaves. |\n| Slaves | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. |\n| Human Population | Racial group | The Humans of the city, the politically extreme are very anti elf and dwarf and believe they should be removed from the city. |\n| Elven Population | Racial Group | The Elves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with dwarves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |\n| Dwarven Population | Racial Group | The dwarves of the city, the politically extreme hate the humans, but will mingle with elves, the feel that [[Gethsemane]] should retake the city for their own. |\n| Off-Human Population | Racial Group | The 'bystanders' of the city's racial conflicts. Once, Off-Human individuals were horribly mistreated by [[The Triumvirate]], but within [[Riverbridge]] they are strangely the neutral party and are able to freely mingle with any group. The most racist members of the other groups are known to say \"at least you're not one of them\" to the off humans. As one would expect, most off humans hate [[The Triumvirate]] and their stupid squabble within the city. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Driftwood Keep | Keep | The city's keep |\n | Riverbridge Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's teleportation circle |\n | Riverbridge Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Burnmarkets | Market | The city's main market which is begrudgingly shared by all local groups by order of the city's Lady. |\n | Dockmarkets | Market | The market closest to the dock. Used for sale of supplies and imports. |\n | Elroy and Dern's | Tavern | Popular tavern to Dwarves and Elves. Reflected by its married proprietors. Elroy being Elvish, and Dern being Dwarvish.  |\n | Bridgeside | Tavern | Popular tavern to Humans of the city. A common place for barfights. |\n | Bildgey's | Tavern | A dockside tavern commonly attended by sailors. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by Lady Trell Gallan, loyal servant to [[King Galliard]]. Lady Gallan is known for being a good ruler but faces many challenges with [[The Triumvirate]] population and its bickering.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Kapeshian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day the city is a hub of trade between the eastern and western kingdoms of [[Zol]]. It is also the bottleneck for the [[The Iron Tracks]] as the bridges that span [[The Narrow Sea]] run through it.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Riverbridge]] was constantly fought over during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]. It changed hands between both [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] many times. Both the city and sections of the great bridges had to be frequently rebuilt.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] of the city could likely immigrate back to [[Gethsemane]] if they wished, given they could afford it. However most do not as their families have been living in the city for quite some time, and feel a sort of ownership of it. Leaving would be giving that up.\n- The Great Bridges of the city were constructed by Grand Arcanist Nalia Xin, who specialized in Structural [[Transmutation]]. The same arcanist who created [[Kierketholl]]'s Megastructures.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.872233901Z","tags":null},"/Rockfire":{"title":"Rockfire","content":"*The Volcanic City, Home to the Fire God [[Daetro]]*\n![[Rockfire skyline.png]]\n\nNo city of [[The Three Corners]] is known to house one of the [[Gods]], save for [[Rockfire]]. The city was built in honor of the benevolent Fire God [[Daetro]]. Despite being located within [[Laenwalde]], a kingdom known for its worship of the [[Zolaen Gods]], the city is filled with devout worshipers of [[Daetro]] who is one of the [[Wayward Gods]]. The kingdom's religious doctrine has made an exception in the case of [[Daetro]]'s followers, as the minor god has a very kind demeanor and cares for his people. This hybridization of beliefs pushes the bounds of religion within [[Zol]], and makes for a perfect place of study for those within the [[Observum]], a branch of [[The University]] focused on the will of [[Observance]] and the behaviors of [[Gods]].\n\n![[rockfire.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Main Opportunity         | [[Rockfire]] is the only city within [[The Three Corners]] that home a physical manifestation of one of the [[Gods]]. The Fire God [[Daetro]] resides within the neighboring volcano, [[Mount Zerstel]]. A god residing on [[The Mortal Coil]] risks a great deal, but it allows [[Daetro]] to have a very close relationship with his followers. [[Daetro]] is only a minor god, but his power is still tremendous. His influence allows for the people of the city to live plentiful lives, and learn about the nature of [[Gods]] in a unique manner. However [[Daetro]]'s influence stops at the borders of the city's territory              |\n| Main Challenge           | A being of such power and influence maintaining such a close and personal relationship with a city creates many unique opportunities. Sometimes it is very difficult navigating these opportunities as a mortal. [[Daetro]] does not give everything to his people. One of his core ideals is strength of self, he encourages this through perseverance through hardship. Another challenge is those who posses different beliefs feel pressured or even ostracized by the presence of a god so near to the city. Some have even gone as far as attempting to dismantle the systems and infrastructure that support [[Daetro]]'s worship. |\n| Climate                  | Desert/Tropical

Politically the crown rules the city, but even the king knows forcing the city one way or another is a tricky gambit. [[Daetro]] allows for the crowns presence within the city, but sees the city as his own.[[Daetro]] would protect the city, but would never fight on the crown's behalf.\n\n## Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nKnown by outsiders as a devout and mythical place, home to a strange and benevolent god. A place where mortals attempt to acquire an understanding of the [[Gods]] who rule over [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nRockfire has not changed much over its existence. It is one of the oldest city's in [[The Three Corners]]. Built by nomads who discovered [[Daetro]], and never conquered due to the god's protection.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- There are no slaves within [[Rockfire]], legally they are allowed by the crown, but [[Daetro]]'s cultural influence has pushed away the practice entirely. Those who bring their slaves to the city are said to meet grim accidents.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.873233906Z","tags":null},"/Ryze":{"title":"Ryze","content":"*The Steam Powered City of Industry*\n![[ryze skyline.png]]\n\nIn the center of the city of steel, copper, and iron lies a tower, called [[Brass Taldora]]. The building is so tall it contains a third of the city's population. It was originally built by a long dead organization of [[Arcanists]] in the early to mid [[First Age]]. These [[Arcanists]], called The Circle of Ezer, were powerful conquerors of [[The Badlands]]. They built the megastructure atop geothermal vents to harness their kinetic and heat energy to use in their grand schemes. Fortunately for The Badlands, [[The Undari]] slayed The Circle of Ezer. Their complex lair was taken over by masses of nomadic tribes seeking refuge. One tribe in particular, Clan Yiniro was a very clever group of [[Gnomes]] who were able to unlock the secrets that made the tower function as a home. It was quickly filled by all who sought its resources and protection. When the tower was at capacity, the citizens began to build a town around its base that eventually grew into the city of [[Ryze]].\n\nIts industrious founding [[Gnomes]] created a vibrant community and became the majority population of the city. The citizens have built upon the base of [[Brass Taldora]] and expanded upon its complexity and ingenuity. [[Ryze]] has become the city of production within [[The Three Corners]]. If something is mass produced, it is likely made here.\n\n![[ryze.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | [[Ryze]] and its people move like clockwork in its day to day operations. So much time and effort has gone into efficiency within the complex city (save for the simplification of civil planning regarding its streets). Finding work and home within [[Ryze]] is not nearly the challenge it is in most cities. There are endless opportunities to work in factories, workshops, shipping yards, and things of the like. They say if something can be built by the hand of mortals, they make it in [[Ryze]] |\n| Main Challenge | The city is a twisted mass of metal pipes, iron catwalks, and dark narrow tunnels. Originally constructed by The Circle of Ezer, a sect of malicious arcanists. It was tamed and built upon by industrious business titans who brought money, expansion and population to the city. This rapid growth within a city originally made by dangerous magic practitioners has many dark things lurking in its twisted alleyways and secret tunnels. Swindlers, criminals, and things rumored to be left behind by The Circle of Ezer lurk in the forgotten, rusted corners of [[Ryze]] |\n| Climate | Temperate/Dry |\n| Cuisine | Cultivated Fruits, Farmed Goods, Flatbread and rice based meals |\n| Export | A staggering variety of factory made goods |\n| Size | Large |\n| Outer Villages| Many |\n| City Leader | High Lady Wezmira Greem |\n| Primary Language(s) | Smallfolk, Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | [[Gnomes]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Built in a shallow crater the city has a bowl-shape to its topography. Recognizable by its riverside location in the center of the Arcadian Planes. |\n| Architecture | Iron piping, metal gantries, large cogs, billowing steam stacks, large paned windows, and dark brick give the city an inescapable industrial appearance  |\n| Color(s) | Purple, Grey, and Blue |\n| Symbolism | A cog wheel with 9 teeth surrounded by a sun's corona formed of 9 points |\n| Defenses | Heavy artillery, airship fleet, sloped approach on all sides |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The high class members of the city.

Infrastructure is well placed, work is available, and crime is dealt with in a passable manner. Lots of this is attributed to its majority population of [[Gnomes]]. The city employs a reasonably present guard, but it is difficult to patrol such a complicated streetway.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]]\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Ryze]] is simply the place where things are made.  Bottles, bandages, cannon balls, nails, pans, pipes, plates, string, tools, watches, wheels, and anything else you could name. This isn't to say these aren't also made elsewhere, merely there are many production lines in the city which create and ship-out these goods all over [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Ryze]] was founded in [[Brass Taldora]], the structure left behind by The Circle of Ezer. A group of dangerous arcanists who were defeated by [[The Undari]]. Over time it became a bastion of creation, production, and education thanks to the hard work of its many citizens and ruling powers.\n\nIt was also the city responsible for the creation of [[Heliodor]], the floating city in the sky. [[Heliodor]] was constructed over many years outside the limits of [[Ryze]]. Many-a worker would commute to the construction site day in and day out to put together one of the great marvels of modern [[Zol]].\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Its inhabitants are known for their unmatched work ethic. While the sun is up, the gears of [[Ryze]] are turning. However when the sun goes down it is a much different story. The workers hang up their gloves and flood the taverns and streets. Every night feels like a sort of festival. People drink, dance and eat as if they were celebrating a good days work.\n- Ryze is the Gnomish word for tower.\n- The bridge between [[Ryze]] and [[Elysium Station]] is another one of the city's famed feats of engineering. Fittingly named *The Strait Bridge*, is a long, thin bridge constructed of steel beams bent into supporting arches that repeat many, many times over along the whole span of The Arcadian Strait.\n- Outside the city limits, where [[Heliodor]] was constructed lies a dangerous and strange slum called The Skaf. It is a sprawling nexus of scaffolding that was used to build [[Heliodor]]. It was abandoned after the flying city was created. Since then, bandits and rustheels have taken it over.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.874233911Z","tags":null},"/Saen":{"title":"Saen","content":"See [[Laenwalde]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.874233911Z","tags":null},"/Sand-Cows":{"title":"Sand Cows","content":"Massive hairy cows who eat cacti and produce palatable milk which man of [[The Kulpis Desert]] use for hydration.

A terrible product of the vast power differences that exist in [[Zol]]*\n![[mask of iron.png]]\n\nSlavery is a dark stain on [[Zol]]'s history and society. It was first spawned shortly after [[The Awakening]]. Many of those who made early grabs at power implemented the practice as an unjust way to accelerate their ascension. By enslaving their enemies, criminals, and others they had a negative perception of, they were able to accomplish feats of civilization and conquest that would have been otherwise unattainable. However, the free labor they had invested in had other grave costs that were paid in blood.\n\nSlaves were known to rebel and kill their masters regularly. In a world where power can be drawn from [[The Trinity]] by even the most oppressed mind, the concept of owning another is a sure way to secure a dark fate. However this did not stop the greedy powers of the world. A constant, distributed war between slaves and slavers has been waged all across [[Zol]], and all throughout its history. The most notable events of it being the [[Alderian Rebellion]] and the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\nSlowly but surely, those oppressed have been gaining ground on those who would control them. The most horrible of practices conducted by those in power have lessened more and more, as it has always pushed slaves to violence. Slaves now receive a sort of *expected* treatment which is considerably less horrible than the slaves who had suffered long ago. This sadly does not mean they lead pleasant lives. Those in power know pushing them to their limit is extremely dangerous, and instead attempt to walk the line. It also helps that public opinion, especially in the east, has changed in favor of the slaves. Many slaves serve a long sentence, rather than being permanently kept at the status. This makes it so they see the light at the end of the tunnel, and undisruptive slaves reach the light sooner. This horrible, manipulative practice structures the current landscape of slavery.\n\nThe status and behavior of slaves is denoted by the mask they wear. All slaves wear one of the following masks:\n- **Mask of Wood** - A common worker slave. These individuals work in lumber yards, mines, shipping yards, and things of the like. Known to keep their head down, and serve out their sentence. These slaves are often nicknamed *Splints*. Which is a shortening of their older nickname *Splinters*, in reference to their wooden masks.\n- **Mask of Porcelain** - A servant of the upper class. These individuals act similarly as paid help, and are often associated with good behavior. Their masks are often designed to look stylish, and most often do not cover the whole face. Some slaves of this status are treated considerably well, and sometimes even become beloved members of the houses they work at. It is seen as a mercy on the surface, but when looking at it more closely one can see the dark horrible manipulations beneath its shallow surface. These slaves are often called *Doll Masks* or *Chips*, based on the wear and tear their delicate masks receive.\n- **Mask of Iron** - Dangerous slaves. Those who have exhibited violence during their time behind a mask of wood or porcelain. These slaves are very rare, as the actions that would earn one a mask of iron usually result in imprisonment or execution. However sometimes the slave posses a useful trait, or they receive this as a sick punishment. These slaves are often given the most dangerous, and grueling jobs. This group is usually called *Iron Masks* or *Blood Masks*.\n\n*Slavery is included in [[Zol]] as an injustice for the characters to overcome. I, as the author feel strongly about the injustice of forcing another person to do something against their will, and/or taking away their freedoms. Any instance of slavery in a story within [[Zol]] is meant as an obstacle for the heroes to overcome. Any character who owns, or perpetuates [[Slavery]] is meant to be seen as an antagonist. There are no exceptions. No inclusion of slavery is meant to reflect real world events, or peoples and their experiences. One also does not need to include this concept to tell a story within this world if they do not wish to. For further explanation of the inclusion of such a dark concept in the world, I encourage you to read the [[Disclaimer]].*","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.876233921Z","tags":null},"/Space":{"title":"Space","content":"see [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.876233921Z","tags":null},"/Space-Matter-and-Energy":{"title":"Space, Matter, and Energy","content":"The 3 aspects of existence in [[Zol]]. These three concepts are all one and the same, merely in different states. These states can be bound, influenced, or shifted to another state using [[Sympathetic bonds]].\n- Academic Arcanists understand [[Zol]] an **infinite four dimensional grid of nodes**. Each one of these nodes are fragment [[The Trinity]], and exist in one of the three states: Space, Matter and Energy. Nodes that are not one of these three states are considered [[Nothingness]]. [[Nothingness]] is distinctly different from Space. Space is a traversable location, while nothingness plays no effect on reality. However nodes in a state of [[Nothingness]] are ever-present, they merely have no effect on reality until something alters them into one of the other states.\n\t- If you were to pick two one dimensional points in space, each of these points could be represented as one node. In-between these two points there is thought to be an infinite number of other nodes, most of which are in a state of [[Nothingness]].\n\t- One does not consider how they are acting on these states directly, this is merely a product of the used [[Magic]]. Acting on nodes differs greatly given the state that the node is in:\n\t\t- **Acting on space** can do things like modify gravity, teleport objects, alter spatial dimensions, alter the properties of dimensional planes of existence, and open portals.\n\t\t- **Acting on matter** can do things like change the form, strength and mass of something.\n\t\t- **Acting on energy** is the most complex, useful, and frequently used ability of an arcanist. Energy can be applied, removed, transferred, and observed. The types of energy are\n\t\t\t- Kinetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that moves things. It is produced in a number of different ways, but largely is based around the motion of matter. Can be transferred quite easily with [[Sympathetic bonds]]. It used to both apply forces, and create/mask sound. Many magical effects will transfer kinetic energy to the surrounding matter. When this effect occurs on the surrounding air with enough force, it produces a shockwave. Sometimes called Thunder.\n\t\t\t- Heat\n\t\t\t\t- Different, but intersectional with the Elemental energy of fire. Heat energy is the energy created reactions, be it magical, biological, or alchemical. Heat energy can be channeled in and out of systems in large quantities with only a single bond.\n\t\t\t- Light\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that is produced by most alchemical reactions, and often by the presence of [[Magic]]. It can both illuminate and darken. Used to create illusions, make things invisible, illuminate rooms,  and mask things in darkness.\n\t\t\t- Gravitational\n\t\t\t\t- The force of attraction between objects, and [[Zol]] itself. This is ever-present, but objects can be cut of from it partially, or entirely by skilled arcanists. This energy can be synthesized, manipulated, or nullified for interesting results.\n\t\t\t- Magnetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that gathers around, and interacts with metal. This is theorized to be responsible for the opportunity of [[Iron Light]].\n\t\t\t- Raw\n\t\t\t\t- [[Zol]] was essentially made from an endless well of power. When it was bound by [[The First Tongue]], much of it was turned into the world is understood to be. What wasn't changed is still present. This is Raw Energy, and it can still be harnessed. This is the most abundant form of energy.\n\t\t\t- Elemental\n\t\t\t\t- Within [[Zol]], there are certain substances or reactions that give off a unique energy which can be harnessed by arcanists. These elemental forces are:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: burning oil\n\t\t\t\t\t- Frost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: a blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t- Lightning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: static generated by rubbing wool against itself\n\t\t\t\t\t- Necrotic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: rotting fruit\n\t\t\t\t\t- Radiance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: refined gold\n\t\t\t\t\t- Poison\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: death-cap mushrooms\n\t\t\t\t\t- Acid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: citrus\n\t\t\t- Cognitive\n\t\t\t\t- All minds emit and accept cognitive energy. This energy is extremely complex and difficult to understand or interfere with. A skilled arcanist can use this to communicate, create illusions, hurt, and even read minds.\n\t\t\t\t- Some academics believe this to be a subsection of Informational Energy.\n\t\t\t- Informational\n\t\t\t\t- All things emit a unique wavelength of energy based on the nature of their existence in [[Zol]] as a product of [[The First Tongue]]. This wavelength can be observed and translated into usable information in many different ways. \n\t\t- **Shifting states**\n\t\t\t- Changing a node's state to another varies in difficulty, but can be the most useful trick for an arcanist if done correctly. This practice is far out of reach for a beginner [[Caster]], but is thought to be what makes an individual into a true arcanist.\n\t\t\t- Space can be turned to massive amounts of energy, the light of a candle can be used to form a suit of armor made from ice, an arrow flying for ones throat can be turned into harmless wind.\n\t\t\t- Nodes changed eventually return to [[The Ethos]] to  revert back to their original state decided upon by [[The First Tongue]]. The amount of time before this reversion is based on the intention and skill of the [[Caster]]. Once they return to their state they rejoin the planes to undergo this lifecycle again.\n\n![[space matter and energy.png]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.876233921Z","tags":null},"/Speakers":{"title":"Speakers","content":"Those who know at least a small portion of [[The Old Tongue]].

This makes the city very safe and a wonderful place to live if you are one of the church's members. |\n| Main Challenge | Living as a 'non-believer' within the city is not illegal, but it may as well be. The whole city revolves around and depends on the opinion of the church. [[Arcana]] and [[Viridescence]] are essentially illegal making for a very peculiar criminal underbelly. |\n| Climate | Temperate/Continental |\n| Cuisine | Hearty meat and potatoes, wild game |\n| Export | Fish, Ships |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| Some |\n| City Leader | Lord Sedrick Wroe |\n| Primary Language(s) | Human |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Humans |\n| Majority Religion(s) | [[Church of Three Fires]] (Trinity-Centric) |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, Extremely religious |\n| Architecture | Massive cathedral like buildings, stained glass windows  |\n| Color(s) | Black and Gold |\n| Symbolism | The symbol for [[The Trinity]] with a flame in the center |\n| Defenses | City garrison, naval fleet, [[Wordbearer]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | Those charged by the crown with running the city, or successful business owners. |\n| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work.

Most of which are fanatical. This group makes up 80% of the city's population |\n| The Conflagratory | Religious Group | Those in charge of maintaining the [[Church of Three Fires]]. There are various levels of authority within this group, but all are highly respected within the city. |\n| Non-Believers | Religious Group | Not an organized group, but a term used for those who do not follow the church.

This group is likely larger than it appears as many people join the church merely by name as a social survival tactic. |\n| The Cathedral's Shadow | Criminal | A criminal underground that was spawned from the need of [[Arcana]] and [[Viridescence]] in a city where it is largely illegal. It has grown from a small operation of spells and incantations to a widespread and very secretive criminal underbelly. |\n| Permitted Will Manipulators | Misc. | A small group of magic users that have been approved and employed by the church to perform [[Magic]] operations involving [[Arcana]] and [[Viridescence]] when needed by the city or church. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Cinderkeep | Keep | The city's main keep |\n | Stigmata Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Stigmata Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle |\n | The Cotton Markets | Market | The city's largest market |\n | The Cathedral of Three Fires | Church | The massive church, even larger than the city's keep.

The coins are in no way magical, but if the [[Caster]] convinces a part of their brain beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are the exact same coin, they become sympathetically bonded. The [[Caster]] can now convince an separate part of their brain in the same way that if one coin moves, the other will move as well. These 2 parts of the brain need to be entirely separated, almost as if they were separate minds on their own. This is called [[Splitting]]. When done successfully, any force applied to one coin affects both coins.\n\t- If you were to lift this coin, you would feel that it weighs a little more than double its normal weight. This is because overall the coins are about 98% alike. They are the same material, shape, and carry the same significance. This is the principal of Likeness. In actuality, the coin would weigh slightly more than double, as [[Sympathetic bonds]] are imperfect.\n\t- One could also split their mind to bond them thermally. Tossing one coin in the fire would cause the other to glow red with heat sympathetically.\n\t\t- Other more complicated bonds could be formed.

[[Teleportation Circles]] are magical constructions utilized by Casters as a both a destination and origin for their teleportations. Teleporting is an extremely temperamental and dangerous thing when simply from moving to one place to another. This is magnified by the distance travelled. However, if one can be familiarized with their origin and destination, it becomes many degrees easier. [[Teleportation Circles]] are constructed to emit very loud and specific informational [[Energy]] signatures. Magic users will memorize themselves with these signatures, greatly reducing the chance for error, and increasing their range.\n\nThe designs of teleportation circles are often mistaken for [[Iron Light]] or [[Iszertion]], however they are neither of these things. They are merely unique patterns created with magical materials, such as [[Chalkstone]], to serve as a landing point. Their circular shape is use for efficiency due to a property of the mathematics surrounding informational [[Energy]]. The informational [[Energy]] signature that they emit quickly degrades, unless the circle is regularly redrawn in the same place. Once it has been redrawn for about 380 to 420 days (about a year) it becomes permanent. This is a result of [[Nodes]] being left in a constant state for so long, they have trouble reverting to their old state, like a leather shoe that has been stretched to fit ones foot perfectly.\n\nAll circles are unique, it is possible to draw a circle exactly like another, but its location will cause it have a different signature. A circle must be known by a [[Caster]] for them to use it. This can be known by physically seeing it and memorizing it, or by viewing diagrams and the supporting geographical information. Because of the logistics of defense and fraud, teleportation circles are well kept secrets. The chambers that hold them are deep under well guarded buildings, usually city keeps, and have many clever defenses. Not all are the same, and some even have no defenses. However most follow a common pattern.\n\nFirstly, they are always surrounded by armed guard. Going in and out of the facility that contains the circle requires individuals to pass through a security checkpoint. The room itself is also armed with magical traps and illusions in case a hostile force were to invade it. There are also set mechanisms in the room to destroy the circle if it ever becomes a threat. Lastly, illusions of light and fog cover the floors of the room to obfuscate the shape of the teleportation circle. Only specific and accredited [[Caster]]s are allowed access to the index of shared teleportation circles across all major cities.\n\nThese shared teleportation circles are called Convergences. Most cities have a Convergence, and some even have more than one. A city many not have a convergence if they lack the magical influences required, and some do not share theirs with the outside world such as [[Yorn et Gaul]] and [[Corinth]]. Many more private teleportation circles exist, but these are not publicly known in the same way as Convergences.\n\nTeleportation leverages complex [[Conjuration]] magic, and it must be conducted by skilled [[Caster]]. Because of the logistics, time invested into education, convivence, and the low number of people who can perform teleportation, it is very expensive to hire someone who can teleport you.\n\n*For more information on Teleportation, see [[Conjuration]]*","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.879233936Z","tags":null},"/Tellab-the-Wise":{"title":"Tellab, the Wise","content":"*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*\n![[Tellab The Wise.png]]\n\nHe who understands all and seeks for others to do the same.

He always bases his decision in utilitarian morals, meaning he will choose destruction for some if it will save the many.\n\n## Realm\nTellab resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]] spending his days in its grand archives that contain an uncountable amount of texts that can only be read by those who have been granted Tellab's favor in death.\n\n## Worshipers\nFollowers of Tellab are typically found in academia and other forms of study. Temples constructed for his worship are almost always incorporated into studies, archives, and libraries.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.880233941Z","tags":null},"/Tenzentak":{"title":"Tenzentak","content":"*The Rift City*\n![[Tenzentak-skyline.png]]\n\nTenzentak, the Rift City. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the sake of its nickname comes from the topography which the city rests upon and the fact that it is built on the cliffs of the grans nothing. The wide rifts within the city house a unique geological phenomenon called [[Rift Iron]], a valuable metal that regrows slowly after being mined. It is used to make objects that can reform after breaking.\n\n![[tenzentak map.png]]\n\nThis natural resource gives Tenzentak a stable economy, and hopeful future. Unfortunately, it also produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has developed powerful [[Iron Light]] air filters that utilize light from [[The Sun]] to clean the air. This ensures the city above the rifts remains clean and beautiful, but leaves those who live in the rifts to suffer.\n\nAt the cities eastern edge lies [[The Grand Nothing]], and [[Gilligan's Lift]] which is controlled by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Built on the edge of [[The Grand Nothing]], the city is full of people who seek to explore its wonder and seek out the mysteries of [[Zol]]'s past. The best parts of the city have a sense of wonder and hopefulness.|\n| Main Challenge | As many of the more fortunate have their sights set on venturing into [[The Grand Nothing]], resources are frequently poorly attributed. Leaving those who are less fortunate to scrape by. |\n| Export |  [[Rift Iron]] |\n| Climate | Temperate/Dry |\n| Cuisine | Spicy Entrees, Flatbreads, Spiced Fruits, Game Foul |\n| Size | Large |\n| Outer Villages| Many |\n| City Leader | Lady Helseena Trodak |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common, Dwarvish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Built on the literal edge of the cliffs, thousands of feet above [[The Grand Nothing]]. The City economy is built around the export of [[Rift Iron]] which is mined from crevasses in the city's center |\n| Architecture | Round stone buildings featuring many columns and arches to buffet the high winds. Large round windows decorated with cast iron filigree, red sheet metal rooves, and many balconies decorate its wealthy districts. Its rifts are filled with ramshackle slums populated by the poorest classes who work in the mines. |\n| Color(s) | White and Red |\n| Symbolism | An arched bridge with a sun above in the sky. Below the bridge is a symmetrical pickaxe. |\n| Defenses | High defensible walls, Eastern facing ballista set to take down airship attacks, and the Tenzentak Garrison (provided by [[The Bladehammer Guild]]) equipped with mediocre rift iron gear that provides an above average level of defense. |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobleborn | Social Class | The nobility of the city are those highly associated with trade, government, and passage to [[The Grand Nothing]] |\n| Midborn | Social Class | Those who have run-of-the-mill jobs. Living in the lower city and in its [[Gate Town]]. |\n| Lowborn | Social Class | Those who live in the slums of the rifts. The sick, addicted, uneducated, or just plain unlucky. Working poor paying jobs related to the mines, or begging for scraps. Many Lowborn suffer from afflictions caused by [[Rift Smog]] |\n| [[The Bladehammer Guild]] | Guild | A massive guild that controls [[Gilligan's Lift]]. The Guild operates all over eastern [[Zol]]. It is made up of many subgroups, all with unique goals that support overarching dream of the whole guild: 'Create a better [[Zol]]' |\n| The Unhealed Dagger | Criminal | The overarching term for the diverse criminal nexus that operates in the depth of the city's rifts. It was once an organized crime syndicate, but no longer has a sole leading party, the name now merely sums up local criminals as a whole. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name                      | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Riftkeep                  | Keep                 | The city's main keep                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Cliffside Square          | Market               | The highest quality and prices you will find for all your general needs in the city.

Gilligan's Lift is a giant elevator-like contraption that brings personnel, resources, and equipment from the city down to the surface of [[The Grand Nothing]]. Its operation is overseen by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].                      |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is led by Lady Helseena Trodak, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Tenzentak]]. Lady Trodak is a headstrong Dwarf of her later years. Her rule (in her own words) is one of 'balance'. [[Tenzentak]] faces unique challenges being the hub of outreach into [[The Grand Nothing]]. \n\nLady Trodak seeks to maintain the economy to support the efforts of those who venture out into [[The Grand Nothing]]. In doing so she requires the export of [[Rift Iron]]. Unfortunately the mining and refinement of the material is the source of many of the city's issues. \n\n[[The Bladehammer Guild]] provides the Tenzentak Garrison, one of the guilds many subgroups, in exchange for much of its funding and tax exemption. This garrison acts as the city's guard, or army in times of war.\n\nThe authority of Lady Trodak wavers the deeper in the rift you go. The lowborn people mostly live by their own rules and codes, only occasionally being harassed by the garrison.\n\n## Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn its current day an age, the city is the most accessible means for one to venture into [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many travel here to seek out the treasures hidden in the ruins of the old world.\n\nIt is also home to the headquarters of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. The guild is the largest operating party of mercenaries, scholars, craftsmen, and politicians. The guild is made up of many subgroups that have legitimacy all over [[Zol]]. Those who take up arms with the guild are given the agency to do much in the kingdoms of [[The Three Corners of Civilization]].\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Tenzentak]] was one of the first cities to be founded in [[Zol]]. Its location on the cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]] was instrumental in [[The Dragon War]]. This was due to the strong up drafting winds that rise from the cliff. These gusts made for difficult sustained airborne combat for dragons.\n\nIts defensible location also caused it to be the last of the Human cities to fall in the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Rebels were able to finally take the city by sending squads of soldiers to climb laterally along the cliffs edge and sabotage the cities defenses during the night.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The natural regrowth of [[Rift Iron]] creates toxic off-gassing called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has created filters powered by sunlight that cleanse the air for the upper city. However those who live in the rifts have to wear face coverings and often have health complications.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.884233962Z","tags":null},"/Thanks":{"title":"Thanks","content":"[[Zol]] took quite a lot of time and effort for me to build, and it wouldn't have been possible without the help, and inspiration from a lot of people in my life.\n\n- Robyn Bixby, my partner in life and my greatest inspiration.

[[The Alktree Haven]], is located on the southeast border of [[The Witchlands]] near [[Viscera]]. It is meant as a place for anyone of any belief to congregate. Within the safe-haven individuals can enjoy open-minded discussion, art, philosophical debate, sermons, and lectures.\n\n## Values\n*\"A place where any person, of any creed, can come to eat, drink, and think freely\"*\n\nAbove all else [[The Alktree Haven]] values peace, and the celebration of individuality. Its reputation is known all across [[Zol]] despite its small size. It is known as a place where anyone can seek refuge, knowledge and companions. So long as you bring good intentions to the tree, you will be met with open arms. \n\n## Origin\nThe haven began as a place of refuge during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Many who did not want to fight fled into the dangerous [[The Witchlands]]. So many of these people, driven from their homes, were lost to the dangers of the wilds. However, a small few discovered the haven guarded by a [[Magic]] tree that warded off monsters.\n\nIt became a home for many, shared experiences amongst its residents drove them to aid anyone who needed it. Slowly but surely it grew in size and reputation. Its was given the name of a lost friend who had died protecting its grounds from bandits.\n\n## Structure\nThe haven has few rules and a very loose hierarchy.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- Two individuals act as the head of the organization. Hal Draen a soft spoken, old and powerful druid (and member of The Coven), and the eccentric Poldan Rike a gifted sorcerer. These two are well respected by many-a-traveler.\n- ### Size\n\t- The haven itself does not have any formal membership, but at any given time there are typically a few hundred people on its grounds at any given time. There are however a few thousand who have considered it a home at some point in their life.\n- ### Rules\n\t- All violence (verbal or physical), discriminatory behavior, and nationalism is banned within the grounds of [[The Alktree Haven]]. Violation of these rules results in banishment from the grounds, further infraction results in execution. This violence is only allowed when done in defense of the Alktree.\n- ### Admission\n\t- Any and all can join under the canopy of [[The Alktree Haven]], lest they commit some grave crime against the things the haven stands for.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- A white mangrove tree on blue backing\n\n## Assets\n- The Alktree itself is a colossal mangrove tree with a hollow interior. The void within the tree has been filled with a large structure that is used by those who reside in the haven. The grounds around the tree contain a small village, all of which is considered the domain of the haven.\n- The haven has no formal defenses, but the tree itself magically wards off monsters\n- In times of bloodshed, any members capable of fighting would lay down their life to protect the haven.\n- Everything within the haven is given freely. Food, shelter, medicine, knowledge, and tools.\n\n## Relationships\n- The nearby nations respect the sanctity of [[The Alktree Haven]], but in past times there have been instances of bounty hunters causing a stir in search of their mark.\n- Many powerful witches of [[The Witchlands]] have sworn to protect it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.884233962Z","tags":null},"/The-Ancestor":{"title":"The Ancestor","content":"*Wandering God, Moral of Origin*\n![[The Ancestor.png]]\n\nTo understand one's place in the world one must first understand where they have come from, and why.

There is power in the place one comes from, a power that can be harnessed.\n\n## Depiction\nOften depicted as a large and powerful warrior. His physiology differs amongst depictions, but he is typically described as a bear humanoid, or a large human-like individual being wearing bear pelts.\n\n## Moral\nOrigin is a broad concept. It entails the things that caused something to come into existence, and the lifespan of experiences that made them what they are now. All things have this story. Hidden within this story is power and purpose, and one can be taught to harness this power.\n\n## Associations\n[[The Ancestor]] is associated with:\n- [[Beastfolk]]\n- Warriors\n- Nature\n- Hunt\n\n## Realm\nWithin [[The Unknown Realm]], [[The Ancestor]]'s domain is said to be a peaceful glade by those who have claimed to see it. A calm cabin in the forest that feels like a place one would retire to after a lifetime of adventures.\n\n## Behavior\n[[The Ancestor]] is said to speak to his followers like a wizened old tutor, or dueling trainer. His advice is simple, but contains much as if he selected every word with intention and ease. As if he had spotted a dozen missteps in your actions, but also sees your growth and efforts.\n\n## Worshipers\nMost who follow [[The Ancestor]] are solitary in their religion. They speak of their beginnings with him as unintentional, but the path of their life brought them to his wisdom. These individuals have pasts filled with hardships, and usually have great challenges ahead of them. They carry great burdens, but are know to fight for those who cannot.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.884233962Z","tags":null},"/The-Anger-of-the-Stars":{"title":"The Anger of the Stars","content":"A strange phenomenon that some fringe academics, and occultists devote much, if not all of their lives to.

Tied to no kingdom, the isles have particular rules in place for the criminals who come and go from this remote island.\n- **Nomans** - an island of monsters and criminal activity.\n- **Isle of Szest** - A thick and dangerous jungle isle, populated by almost no sapient beings.\n- **Isle of Jexies** - A jungle island populated by a proud tribe of [[Grung]]\n- **Old Hezera** - An island that was once home to the city of Hezera within what was once South [[Kapesh]], before it became [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. Hezera was mostly destroyed during [[The Illithid Invasion]], and was completely lost during the early [[Beast Ire]] plague. Monsters have since overrun the island.\n- **Vorgal** - A peculiar island that is rumored to be home to a secretive monastic tradition. However those who travel there tend to find little of anything.\n- **The Smatterings** - A collection of hundreds of tiny islands that pepper the center of [[The Archsea]].\n- **Valencliff** - A jungle island perched on the very edge of [[The Grand Nothing]].\n- **Wanderer's Wall** - an island that is said to be the first location in which [[The Wandering Gods]] touched down in [[Zol]]. Now home to a collection of [[Sworn Wanderers]] who live in isolation.\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n[[The Archsea]] is the most widely civilized sea. It is the waters that connect the east and west. There are settlements all along its coasts, and it borders [[The Grand Nothing]]. Its surface is no stranger to warfare, trade, piracy, and adventure.\n\nMany people live upon its coast and some even live deeper into its borders in [[Abdjadan]] and [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]].\n\n## Borders\nThe Sea's edges reach:\n- [[The Kulpis Desert]]\n- [[Laenwalde]]\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[The Grand Nothing]]\n\t- It is a mystery as to how the draining of water into [[The Grand Nothing]] effects sea levels. Despite the massive volumes that pour over its edge, the seas never drain. Some believe it is because the ocean is infinite, others think it is the will of [[Ohlit]].\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n- [[The Vast Sea]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.887233977Z","tags":null},"/The-Arendari":{"title":"The Arendari","content":"See [[Hoss]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.887233977Z","tags":null},"/The-Astral-Sea":{"title":"The Astral Sea","content":"See [[The Ethos]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.887233977Z","tags":null},"/The-Auroran-Summits":{"title":"The Auroran Summits","content":"![[The Auroran Summits.png]]\n\nOne of the smaller mountain ranges within [[The Three Corners]], but its size does not detract from its majesty.

These are thought by scholars to be manifestations of [[The Ethereal Plane]] visible in the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Many mountains give them off, and a lot of [[Zol]]'s more northern regions may sometimes witness them spontaneously in the sky at night.

The landscape that was home to the ancient people of [[Zol]] was struck with a force so destructive it demolished nearly everything, reducing it to dust and ruins. What was left was a seemingly endless wasteland.\n\nParts of ruined towns and other elements of civilization have been discovered. Murals, magical relics, scraps of paper, bones, tapestries, pottery, metal and glassworks, and ruined machines tell of an ancient people far more advanced than modern people. These ruins are strangely not obliterated like many would expect. The exact nature of [[The Undoing]]'s destruction was not akin to an explosion, but more like an unraveling of the past.\n\nIt is thought this civilization had a comprehensive understanding of [[The First Tongue]] and [[The Old Tongue]], and they lived centuries long lifespans. Only evidence of [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] in the old world have been uncovered. \n\nDue to this evidence, paired with the fact that [[Humans]] are much shorter lived than [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]], many theories about [[Old Zol]] were created.

[[The Bladehammer Guild]] is the largest guild in all [[The Three Corners]]. It is an organization recognized by every city, even [[The Glassius Reach]] knows their mission. Located on the very edge of [[The Grand Nothing]] in [[Tenzentak]]. \n\nThe guild is made up of a core organization, and many factions within. Individuals can join up with [[The Bladehammer Guild]], and become members of one, or many of its internal factions. Full members of [[The Bladehammer Guild]] receive a thin flat medallion with a unique magical signature. No one of the public knows how these are made, and the signature is very hard to falsify. The faces of the medallions look like hammered metal, and the edges are bordered like a coin.\n\nThese medallions, often called *Slates*, are known all across [[Zol]]. Those who are venturing out into the world on some quest, mission, pilgrimage, or other type of adventure may use these medallions to gain favor by reputation of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. Those of the guild are expected by most to act fairly, and justly. A Slate will not open every door, but it will make it easier to find work, gain access to non public spaces, and show intent.\n\n## Values\n*\"Together we stand.\"*\n\nThe ideals of [[The Bladehammer Guild]] paint a picture of a unified [[Zol]]. The guild is the product of the same thinking that brought forth the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. If we can bring down the barriers that divide us, we can rebuild all that was lost in [[The Undoing]] once again and live as free, prosperous people.\n\n## Origin\nFounded by the [[Alderian Council]]. Its name,  *Bladehammer*, comes from the ideal of rebuilding and reclaiming the world by hammer and steel.\n\n## Structure\nThe guild is a massive and complex organization. It is headed by Captain Helg Corsair, and his supporting council made up of the leaders of every sub faction, and other influential members of the guild. Within the guild, all start as guild members. There are many ways to contribute as a guild member, such as: combat, academia, medicine, strategy, economics, trade, policy, law, politics, and craft. Those who prove themselves as high quality guild members are given a \"marked\" slate. An upgraded slate bearing the symbol of the guild. Members of this rank are called \"Full Marked\". Promising leaders of the guild become Guild Minds. Their slate is given a red band to show their rank.\n\nFull Marked Guild Members are allowed to recommend individuals for admission by way of guild ticket (See Admission). Guild Minds have the responsibility of dispatching guild resources on missions.\n\n- ### Leadership\n\t- Captain Helg Corsair, who is a well respected dwarven man with a scarred face. As well as his supporting council of Guild Minds.\n- ### Size\n\t- The Guild is around 4 thousand strong, but greatly distributed all across [[The Three Corners]].\n- ### Rules\n\t- Do not betray one's medallion.\n- ### Admission\n\t- Joining [[The Bladehammer Guild]] is a difficult, but worthwhile task. Many high ranking members of the guild will carry orange tickets called guild tickets with them. If they see someone in the world they think is worthy of the guild, they can give them one of these tickets. A guild ticket will take on from anywhere in [[The Three Corners]] to [[Tenzentak]] by way of [[The Iron Tracks]]. Once at [[The Bladehammer Guild]], these fresh faces can sign up for a job. These jobs act as a challenge, if the member of the guild they do the job for is happy with their performance, they are welcomed in as a permanent member. The factions within however each have their own rule about new members joining with them.\n\t- Many new members will often find a mentor within the guild. This person helps them navigate the complex political landscape of the guild.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- A crossed sword and smith's hammer\n\n## Assets\n- [[Gilligan's Lift]]\n\n## Relationships\n- Largely appreciated all across [[Zol]]\n- Allies with many other organizations such as\n\t- [[The University]]\n\t- [[Kerketh Academy]]\n\t- [[The Coven]]\n\t- and many more\n\n## Factions\nSome of the factions within the guild are:\n- The Heavy Shield\n\t- A band of altruistic mercenaries who fight to protect the common people \n- The Second Heart\n\t- A network of unassuming spies who seek to weed out corruption\n- [[Kerketh Academy]]\n\t- A dispatchment of the academy within the ground of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]\n- [[The University]]\n\t- A dispatchment of [[The University]] within the ground of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]\n- The Repariat\n\t- Those who seek people and places who have faced destruction that was not stopped. Here they provide medical aid, resources, reconstruction, and defense if they can \n- Gilded Heart Mercenaries\n\t- A brutish band of mercenaries who align with The Guild's overall mission, but are known for their willingness to fight for coin.\n\nIt is worth nothing that there are many individuals within the organization who do not associate with a faction. They merely identify with the guild as a whole. Guild members who form bonds amongst themselves can also pull approved allies into faction-related business. This practice is known as **Compatriotism**. \n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.891233997Z","tags":null},"/The-Blades":{"title":"The Blades","content":"![[The Blades.png]]\n\nA haunting range of sharp peaked mountains, slanted steeply with their peaks pointed at the north east.

Some describe it as a liquid while other speak of it like sand or a strange fungus. It is the source of the phrase 'seeing red' when feeling great anger.\n\n## Symbolism\n[[The Bloodshed Presence]] has no recognizable symbolism.\n\n## Behavior\nActing as a force, [[The Bloodshed Presence]] does not communicate with mortals and may not even be capable of such acts.\n\nWhen overcome by the presence, mortals experience a rush like no other. A strange drug-like feeling that urges you to seek violence. Its effects cause memory loss, but seem to deter exhaustion.\n\nMany who experience its influence become addicted to the feeling and do not speak of it for fear of judgement or other worse forms of societal persecution.\n\n## Realm\n[[The Bloodshed Presence]] is thought to reside in [[The Void]], but as it has no physical body it must have some manifestation in [[The Ethereal Plane]].\n\n## Worshipers\nNo major groups worship [[The Bloodshed Presence]] historically, but it has a notable reputation amongst military groups.

The [[Viridium]] also sends out many to travel [[The Three Corners]] to search for understanding, and new life which can further academia.\n\nThose who can conduct magic using [[Viridescence]] are often called [[Druids]] or [[Antiverdants]].

These powers allow a normal person to transform into a massive and powerful titan, capable of incredible feats of strength and destruction. No one knows the origin of this power, but it all revolves around a single individual called The Crux.\n\nThe Crux is a genetic power, passed down through generations. One member of each generation gains the powers of The Crux. The Crux's sole abilities are the capacity to choose champions to become titans, and the ability to tap into a titans senses. Some think that The Crux also has increased physical abilities, and maybe even their own titan form, but this is rumor at best. The Titans are all loyal to The Crux, save for the occasional aberrant soul.\n\nTitans are bound by a few rules. It takes a great deal of power to enter their titan form, and can only do so every few days at best. Staying in their form is difficult, and most can only remain as a titan for so long.  If a titan dies, The Crux can make a new titan of the same type after the refractory period it would take for that titan to be able to retake its form. No more of one titan type can exist at a time. Each titan also has a weakness unique to them, and being made titan shortens ones lifespan by over half. Becoming a titan grants one amazing physical power, but the power of a titan is ultimately based on the initial skill of a person before they are made titan.\n\nThe titans are as follows:\n\n## The Blade Titan\n![[The Blade Titan.png]]\n\nThe Blade Titan is the smallest of the Titans. It stands at about 15 feet tall, and possesses the ability to grow bladed weapons out of its skin. It is an extremely adept fighter with these weapons, and can remain in titan form for nearly a full day. Its weapons are extremely useful to it, however its strangely weak to the material its blades are made from. When not in the hand of The Blade Titan, its weapons degrade into nothing within a matter of minutes.\n\n## The Burning Titan\n![[The Burning Titan.png]]\n\nThe Burning Titan is an extremely hard being to kill. It is quite large at about 30 feet tall. The difficulty in killing The Burning Titan comes from the extreme heat it emits. The longer it is in its titan form, the hotter it burns. After about half an hour, merely standing near it singes flesh, making it nearly impossible to approach. However, its burning is its own weakness. The heat quickly destroys its titan form, and is return back to a normal person after only an hour of fighting.\n\n## The Power Titan\n![[The Power Titan.png]]\n\nThe Strongest of the titans. Despite its relatively short size of 25 feet, The Power Titan is the physically strongest of the titans. Some think The Power Titan is the most dangerous of the titans. This is amplified by the fact its weakness is not publicly known, and that it can stay in its titan form indefinitely.\n\nDuring The [[Alderian Rebellion]], The Power Titan betrayed [[Kapesh]] and fought for the side of the rebels. No one knows exactly what brought the titan at the time to do so, but it killed the other titans dozens of times before their death. Its sacrifice was one of the major reasons for the rebels victory until [[Deepspell]] and their mages joined the rebels side.\n\n## The Sinew Titan\n![[The Sinew Titan.png]]\n\nArguably the most deadly titan. The Sinew Titan's horrifying appearance is one of twisted, grey muscle fibers, and a toothy maw. It stand 50 feet tall, and has many long tendrils coming off of its body. It is likely the most frail of the titans, as its weakness is at each of its main joints. However its long reach given by its very precise control of its tendrils allows it to level forests and armies. Unfortunately for it, The Sinew Titan has a refractory period of many months. It can stay in its form for about 2 hours.\n\n## The Towering Titan\n![[The Towering Titan.png]]\n\nThe largest, and most feared of the titans. The Towering Titan is a rare sight on any battle field as it has a refractory period of nearly a year. However its massive size, and blasts of burning light it can shoot from its eyes make it a terrifying foe. The Towering Titan stands about 140 feet tall. Its weakness lies deep beneath the flesh on the back of its neck. It is also very dangerous as when it enters its form, it unleashes a destructive blast that can level buildings. Rumor claims that sometimes entering this form kills the host, and The Crux has to control its body. The Towering Titan can stay in this form for up to 2 hours.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.905234068Z","tags":null},"/The-Cult-of-the-Mothers":{"title":"The Cult of the Mothers","content":"A dangerous and mysterious cult of the witches who betrayed [[The Coven]].

It is also why there are huge distances between cities. Many tried to found cities over the ages, however the vast majority didn't grow past the size of a small settlement before they were destroyed. These vast distances between them are also what made the cities so unique from one another. Their culture's were formed largely in isolation, and only began to regularly cross over with each other when [[The Iron Tracks]] were built.\n\nHowever, the wilderness is not impassable. There have been many in [[Zol]]'s history with enough agency to move about them without extreme danger. Some even live their whole lives within the wilderness. This is made possible only through some form of protection. Be it their own power, or the power of another which guides them. \n\nAs an example, some wizards build towers in [[The Witchlands]] to get away from society. Their magical power acting as their defense against threats. Then there are places like The Ashcamps within [[The Kulpis Desert]].

Those who venture beyond these edges of the explored world do not often return. No mortal knows how large [[Zol]] truly is, and this *Edgelessness* exists in more ways than one. Many cartographers and explorers will venture around treacherous regions, far from the edge of the map, such as [[The Witchlands]]. They will learn its shape, and illustrate it as a forest of beautiful trees. When asked for details about these trees, the secrets and complexities held within, the map makers cannot provide true answers. These inner edges, drawn as a crowd of simplistic trees, or a wall of imposing mountains, are thinner than the paper they are written on. [[Zol]] is edgeless, inside and out.\n\n*Edgeless*, is a term often used by the people of [[Zol]] to describe the dangerous and unknown. It is used to describe more than just maps. People, places, and things can be edgeless as well. It exists on a sort of spectrum, some things only seem edgeless after they have been carefully understood, while others almost seem to radiate Edgelessness like a shining sun. The following is an example of this phenomena:\n\nA commoner, who lives a simple, comfortable life heads into their usual tavern to find an unknown traveler sitting in their preferred seat. Emboldened by anger after a long days work, the commoner confronts the drifter. However, their anger is quickly replaced with fear and regret when the traveler turns to face them. Their features are not abnormal, but something about the travelers eyes strike the commoner with fear. There is no magical trickery at play, but somehow, the commoner knows that the wanderer's eyes have seen things beyond comprehension. The stranger says nothing, merely watching the commoner with impassivity. Something about this stranger makes them seem like almost they *exist* more than every person in the room. They emit a feeling of power, and mystery simply by existing. The commoner realizes everyone else in the room has seemingly figured this out already, and flees the tavern. You do not cross someone who is *Edgeless*.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.906234073Z","tags":null},"/The-Edinokai":{"title":"The Edinokai","content":"The Saen School of Swords.

All of the Elemental Planes are under the [[The Mortal Coil]]'s effect. Each plane is a surreal, majestic thing of its own right. They are home to strange beings composed almost exclusively of matter and energy pertaining to their respective element. Some of these creatures manifest as beings that are something like a fairy, or a spirit called [[Sylfs]]. These\n\nThese 4 Elemental planes are:\n\n## The Plane of Invigorant\nThe Plane of Oceans and Forests. An ever spanning ocean covered in island forests. Most plant animal and fungi here are all completely unique all the way down to the individual level. They live and die in incredibly short spans and seem to spawn from the environment itself.\n\n![[Invigorant.png]]\n\nOrganisms that do not live and die in uniqueness do live here, but they are uncommon species, like the voracious wasp eels. This is plane supplies the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life giving matter.\n\n## The Plane of Immolation\nThe Sun of [[Zol]]. The Plane of Immolation is what gives the heat of flame and the radiant light to [[Zol]].\n\n![[immolation.png]]\n\nRumors of a city of flame within Immolation exist, but due to its harsh environment there is little information.\n\n[[The Sun]] is an ever moving portal that passes through sky leading to Immolation.\n\n## The Plane of Temperament\nRock, sand, metal, soil and gemstone. The foundation of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is said that The Plane of Temperament is accessible by taking long lateral journeys through [[The Underdark]]. Supposedly it is difficult to judge when one enters or exits Temperament as it manifests as a ever spanning series of caverns.\n\n![[Temperment.png]]\n\nPopulations of Dangerous [[Giants]] and great chitinous beasts reside in Temperament, some of which even have their own cities.\n\n\n## The Plane of Tempest\nThe sky itself. The Plane of Tempest is the most vast and peaceful of [[The Elemental Planes]]. It provides the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life-sustaining oxygen.\n\nIt can be accessed via long lateral journeys in the sky. It contains many avian species who travel freely between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and Tempest.\n\n![[Tempest.png]]\n\nTempest contains no landmasses, but does house many large beings known as Buoyants. These beings appear like a mix between a whale and a large balloon, and act as a resting place for flying creatures who need it. Large Buoyants even have forests growing on their backs.   \n\n## Sylfs\n[[Sylfs]] are strange beings, born by unknown means. Their bodies are not corporeal, but they posses very powerful minds. Many think of them as self contained souls, never bound to a body of their own. They can influence the appearance of their physical form, but exist as one of four types:\n- **Mistings** who hail from **Invigorant**, appear as constantly shifting creatures of growing plants and flowing water\n- **Cindrins** who hail from **Immolation**, appear as beings made from cracked and burning stone\n- **Stalegs** who hail from **Temperament**, appear as beings of lightly colored crystal \n- **Typhis** who hail from **Tempest**, appear as beings of flowing wisps of air and small clouds of vapor\n\n[[Sylfs]] are capable of speech, and minor manipulations of the physical world. However the most notable thing about them is their ability to interface with the minds other beings. [[Sylfs]] are known to bond with beings they individually appreciate. This bond allows the being and the sylf to communicate, and grants the being magical power through the will of [[Observance]]. For most this power manifests as a minor affinity for whatever element the sylf is comprised of, but in some cases the bond grows more powerful. A strong bond allows for great feats of magic, and in some cases an individual can manifest their sylf as a physical object.\n\nHowever this bond is not so easily gained, [[Sylfs]] are known to be very stubborn and elusive. There is only one consistent case of [[Sylfs]] bonding mortals: the [[Genasi]].  [[Genasi]] are a small race of people located in [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]. Their home is located in a space where the barrier between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and [[The Elemental Planes]] is considerably thinner. This allows for [[Sylfs]] to move back and forth between the [[Planes]] with ease.\n\nGenasi are born with an appearance and physiology similar to humans, but in the first decade of their lives they typically bond a sylf, this alters their appearance, and grants them abilities. However [[Genasi]] are not the only beings who can receive this bond, but bonds outside of this typical relationship are extremely rare.\n\nWhen a bond is obtained, it may appear in a number of different ways. Some sylfs like to be very present. Appearing physically to everyone, and speaking vocally. Others may be more shy, speaking and appearing only to their bonded individual. Some are so elusive they only manifest as a deep, subconscious thing, which has been described as an internal friendly presence or emotion. These bonds are very intimate things and extremely hard to break.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.907234078Z","tags":null},"/The-Elven-Dwarven-Concord":{"title":"The Elven-Dwarven Concord","content":"## The Elven-Dwarven Concord\n[[Gethsemane]] was a place of high tension between the [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]].

Many see the members of [[The First Bastion]] as righteous protectors. Others see them as self righteous war-dogs.\n\nThe campus itself is a large cathedral, surrounded by training grounds, barracks, classrooms, libraries, and The Hall of Feasts.

This language is what binds [[The Trinity]] into all of existence within Zol. It is referred to as a language for lack of a better term. Unlike modern language, The First Tongue must be spoken with more than just words and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of Common must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The First Tongue must be spoken with uncontested knowledge, unbound emotion, iron will, perfect artistry, exact movement, unwavering faith, and a [[Vizir]] like no other. The words of The First Tongue are so complex they cannot be recorded in any useful manner of writing.\n\nThe First Tongue is thought to be a collection of names an rules for all things in [[Zol]]. As a result it is a broad language, but is theorized to have limits in this way. It is generally accepted that the only being to know the full span of The First Tongue is [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Despite the omnipotence this would give a being, his scripture claims he does not utilize this power as it would be unjust. This sparks debate among scholars and theologians.\n\n## Relation to The Old Tongue\nThe First Tongue is the predecessor of [[The Old Tongue]], and is much more powerful. An individual who knows a word from The First Tongue has full dominion over that element of [[Zol]]. This grants [[Magic]] power akin to that of a god. Acquiring a word from The First Tongue is arguably the single most difficult thing one can achieve as an individual in [[Zol]]. Some believe its discovery brings one to the level of godhood.\n\n## Discovery and Possession\nLittle is known about how to actually acquire a word from The First Tongue, and those who do know keep it a well guarded secret. It is thought that before [[The Undoing]], there were many who possessed words. In modern times, there are only 5 publicly known individuals who possess a word. They go by the title of [[Wordbearers]]. Rumors and legends tell of many more than 5, but that remains to be proven.\n\nDiscovering a word in The First Tongue is said to feel like witnessing the whole universe itself for a single moment. A second spans into an eternity and the truths held behind the word you have discovered come as no surprise to you, as you are its champion. It instead come as a comfort, a tool like no other for you to shape [[Zol]] with. Some refer to this discovery as *Snapping*.\n\nOne the major differences The First Tongue has over [[The Old Tongue]] is words from The First Tongue can be passed down to a worthy apprentice. This requires that the apprentice has studied for a lifetime under the [[Wordbearers]], and has a mastery over the subject beaten only by their master Word Bearer. This allows for individuals to complete a challenge far less great than discovering a word on their own. The word is passed upon death given the Wordbearer wills it so, and the candidate is worthy. This has never happened in record, but [[Wordbearers]] speak of it often.\n\nThis has allowed some words to stay amongst the population for many generations, and has defined history in many ways. The words publicly known and available in the modern world are:\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- [[The Word of Shadow]]\n- [[The Word of Blades]]\n- [[The Word of Wrath]]\n- [[The Word of Growth]]\n\nThere has never been a record of an individual possessing more than one word, nor 2 individuals possessing the same word. It is suspected this is a principal of The First Tongue, but it also may just be a product of its rarity.\n\n## Wordbearer Treaty\n[[Wordbearers]] are extremely powerful, and [[Warfare]] involving them can cause massive amounts of destruction. Due to this fact, [[Wordbearers]] do not often engage in conflict. This is not something that is mandated by any law, as no government could hope to control a [[Wordbearer]].

Despite its difficult past, Alderun now flourishes with life and culture. A land where anyone can choose to be who they want, but with great freedom comes discourse.\n\n## Cities\n- [[Tenzentak]] - The Rift City, built on the very edge of the world\n- [[Rails]] - The City of Trains\n- [[Holocene]] - The City of Art and Beauty\n- [[Deepspell]] - The City of Magic and Innovation\n- [[Zessgorn]] - The City of Cups\n- [[Hanen]] - The Quaint City of Heroes\n- [[Ka'thoor]] - The Border City of Orcs\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\nDiverse like no other region of its size, The Alderian wilds contains a menagerie of animals, plants, and monsters that differ wildly as one travels from [[Zessgorn]] to [[Holocene]].\n\nThe regions diversity gives much opportunity to its people, but its monsters cause for many problems. The Cities of Alderun spend much of their resources focusing on inner workings of their urban centers. This leaves the wilds an untamed and lawless place. Criminals and monsters roam the remote places of Alderun. While not as dangerous as its western neighbor, [[Kapesh]]. One would not want to be caught off the safe path in these wilds.\n\nGeographical features vary from gorgeous coast lines, rolling hills, spanning rivers, large lakes, and the ever strange cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]]. -Its climates vary from the tropical coasts near [[Zessgorn]] to the frigid stretch of the Dyed Forest.\n\n## History\nDuring the [[First Age]], human sovereigntists claimed that the Off-Humans must live a life of servitude under the Human population. The [[Humans]] of Kapesh enforced themselves as 'higher beings' over the [[Off-Human]] races. The oppressed people were forced to undergo oppressions, slavery, and in some cases even dark experiments. These tests were intended to discover a way to restore the [[Great Magic]] of the humans by recombining the Off-Humans with their once hosts. The humans were understandably met with resistance.\n\nRebellions against the humans rose and fell. The true overturning of South Kapesh was not until [[Eirmond the Brave]] rose to glory. Eirmond was a stellar fighter, and a great leader to the Off-Human People.  A [[Half-Orc]] man, born in [[Ka'thoor]]. He won Alderun, city-by-city, a civil war that is now known as the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe Kingdom's population consists mostly of [[Off-Human]]s and [[Humans]], but does contain many members from all the [[Races]] of [[Zol]]. Each city has its own unique culture and peoples.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe kingdom is governed by the [[Alderian Council]]. A senate of representatives from each of the cities who work as a unit to make decisions, and delegate resources across the cities.\n\nThe high degree of freedom given by the [[Alderian Laws]] has allowed for a thriving economy where any enterprise can succeed given it has merit. However this freedom does also bring discourse and chaos.\n\nGoverning people with a high degree of freedom is quite difficult. This means cut throat competition between businesses, crime, and those unlucky few who fall through the cracks of a well intentioned system. \n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt and culture is very abundant in The Free Cities. This is due to the fact each city upholds a unique culture, and every individual is allowed to worship any benevolent god they choose.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nWithin the Free Cities, academics are associated with [[Kerketh Academy]]. An institution open to anyone who can prove themselves under examination, and pay the high tuition costs. \n\nThere is also a fair degree of education and apprenticeship that occurs at [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. As well as the occasional private tutelage is conducted here and there.\n\n## Political Climate\nThe Free Cities are on good terms with almost all kingdoms of [[The Three Corners]] save for their neighbor [[Kapesh]]. The relationship with [[Kapesh]] is difficult due to their history, but in modern times it has resolved to reluctant amicability.\n\nWithin the Kingdom, the various cities have complicated relationships. The court of The Free Cities constantly changes friendships and rivalries, however there are a few constants amongst the chaos. [[Zessgorn]] is a notably difficult city to organize as its crime has gotten far out of hand, and [[Holocene]] does not play nicely with the overall mission of The Free Cities as their nobility is known for exploiting the less fortunate.\n\n## Military\nThe Kingdoms military is comprised of the cities' garrisons. It may not be the most grand of militaries, but it is well supplemented by [[The Bladehammer Guild]] and [[Kerketh Academy]]. It also has a sizeable navy within [[Zessgorn]]. The Kingdom would not be a great threat if it were to attack, but it is well placed for defense due to its mountains.\n\n## Borders\nThe Free Cities border the kingdoms of: \n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n\nAs well as the wilds of:\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[The Grand Nothing]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.915234119Z","tags":null},"/The-Glassius-Reach":{"title":"The Glassius Reach","content":"![[The Glassius Reach.jpg]]\n\nGeographically and politically isolated, The Reach is cut off from the rest of the world by [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]] and the treacherous [[Wrath Wastes]].

When rumors began about an [[Off-Human]] people who have the ability to take any form of their choosing, the grim folk-lore essentially created itself. Common folk began to accuse their friends and family of being '[[Changelings]]' who had killed and eaten their friends. A hidden threat that had come to their city to steal faces and coins.\n\nEventually, emissaries from the western world began to interact with The Reach. With increased exposure, the mythos around the [[Changelings]] began to dissipate a bit. However, the public fear toward the kingdom remained.\n\nSome brave [[Changelings]] venture out into the the other kingdoms as proud members of their race, but most who do so under their natural disguise mimicking another of [[Zol]]'s [[Races]]. Their disguises a necessary precaution against many of [[Zol]]'s foreigners.   \n\nDuring the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]] masking as important members of western society. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would grow to fame as the [[Western War]].\n\nFought mostly in the treacherous Pits of Zeralis, this war increased in intensity over a relatively short period and eventually amounted in the destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and the emergence of [[The Word of Wrath]]. A [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin who protects [[The Glassius Reach]] with his life.\n\nOne of the major results of this war was the loss of [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]]. An object so central to the culture of [[Changelings]] that it has caused irreparable damage to their religion and culture. One recent example of this is some [[Changelings]] born within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] do not have the ability to change their form.\n\nDespite the hardship and discrimination the people of [[The Glassius Reach]] have faced, they have gone to great lengths to preserve their way of life. The [[Changelings]] have succeeded well in upholding their culture considering what has happened to them.\n\n## Inhabitants\nThe population of [[The Glassius Reach]] is made up of almost entirely [[Changelings]].  A people with a very reserved, unique culture.\n\nThere are two things one would notice when first arriving in the cities of The Reach:\n- **Extreme Formality** - The people of The Reach have very set traditions, and procedures called [[The Pattern]]. The Pattern keeps society well mannered, fair, and efficient. The Pattern determines things like how long one should stay at a host's house after eating dinner, how much one is allowed to drink at a wine house, and even important things like deciding a ruler. Ignoring these formalities is seen as extremely rude, and in many cases infractions against the rules of [[The Pattern]] are a punishable offence. The pattern stems from the influence of [[The Oldshards]] seeming to favor some individuals more than others. Over many generations scholars and philosophers have tried to determine the factors that cause this favor. The resulting research is what shaped [[The Pattern]]. It is half based in empirical evidence, and half in personal belief. It is a thing debated by many.\n- **True Forms, Pure Forms, and Pure Voice** - [[Changelings]] posses the ability to alter their physical form to any humanoid shape of their choosing, given they are still of the same approximate size and shape. This alteration is not the use of [[Illusion]] magic like many assume, but actual [[Transmutation]] of the physical body, even modifying things like sex and metabolism, and the very [[Matter]] they are made from. This creates an interesting dynamic where people have the ability to appear however they choose, and can even mask as other people. To combat the obvious challenges this poses, as well as introduce a concept of individuality, [[Changelings]] will often spend their youth conceptualizing an appearance called a **True Form**. A highly unique, detailed, and beautiful appearance that is very difficult to counterfeit. This form is seen as sacred, and is to be respected by all other [[Changelings]]. One's true form may make them appear as if they are made of translucent crystal, finely made porcelain, woodgrain, or anything one can reasonably imagine. [[Changelings]] use this form to identify themselves amongst their own society. It is illegal to attempt to counterfeit someone else's True Form, and it is extremely rare one shows their true form outside of The Reach's Cities, especially to outsiders.\n  \n  [[Changelings]] can also be identified by two other means: their **Pure Form**, and Pure **Voice**. These two traits being ones physical appearance at birth, and natural tonality of voice. These are seen as sacred and highly important to the [[Changelings]]. Some compare showing one's pure form to the concept of nakedness, but it is not quite that. There is no shame in doing so, publicly or privately, but one would not do so without thought the same way one would not wear a wedding gown at a funeral. The occasion must be fitting.\n  \n  **Pure Voice** is another category of identification. Since [[Changelings]] can alter their appearance at will, physical traits are not as treasured when it comes to things like attraction or conventional beauty. However modifying one's voice, especially in a way that is pleasant sounding, is quite difficult for a Changeling. This makes having a beautiful voice an ideal within The Reach's society.\n\nThere are also a very small number of non-changeling peoples within The Reach. However these individuals had to go to great lengths to be welcomed into the xenophobic society of [[Changelings]]. They must follow strict rules and are always viewed as outsiders.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe Kingdom of The Reach is governed by 2 individuals (one for each city) known as [[Shardcallers]]. Each is supported by their own council, all of which are democratically elected and extensively tested for their positions. Those in positions of leadership are viewed in a unique way within The Reach.\n\nElected officials are seen as being 'owned' by the people of the city. The live very strict lifestyles where their whole days are scheduled out. Things like dining and recreation time are predetermined for them. Their homes are open to the public (and highly guarded). Citizens can come watch the leadership eat, sleep, and work if they choose to do so. While this sounds demeaning to outsiders it is the highest honor of the [[Changelings]]. Those who seek these positions spend their entire lives training for the opportunity.\n\nThe [[Shardcallers]] of The reach are Yemodhan Surrite of [[Yorn et Gaul]] and Osieur Xetac of [[Corinth]].\n\nThe Reach has a socialist approach to its economy, and uses its own denomination of crystalline currency called a Glassmark which is divided into 4 types of coin:\n- **Quartermark** - A small clear crystal cut into hexagons from quartz called, bearing similar value to a copper coin\n- **Halfmark** - A medium sized yellow crystal cut into pentagons from citrine, bearing similar value to a silver coin\n- **Nearmark** - A medium sized green crystal cut into squares from fluorite, bearing similar value to a gold coin\n- **Fullmark** - A large sized opaque crystal cut into triangles from celestine, bearing similar value to a platinum coin\n\nThe [[Glassian Laws]] are very strict, but well respected by most. [[The Glassius Reach]] at one time, had the lowest crime rate of all the kingdoms. Now that has begun to change with the many years of hardship in [[Yorn et Gaul]].\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\nArt is very important to the culture of The Reach. Individuals will become career artists to try and encapsulate the many complex factors and ideals within their society. Visual arts like painting are prevalent within the cities, but more commonly artists focus on singing and [[Form Art]].\n\nSinging holds a special importance within The Reach because of the importance of one's Pure Voice. Vocalists will occasionally play with instrumental accompaniment, but more commonly will sing acapella in grand opera-like performances. Frequently done in a theatrical manner.\n\n[[Form Art]] is a changeling practice of altering ones own form into beautiful or interesting ways. This is done to express emotions or for general entertainment.\n\nThe general society around The Reach is very strict, utilitarian, well mannered. Individuals will generally try and keep an indifferent demeanor and won't stick their nose into other peoples business. [[Changelings]] are very proud beings, to offend them is a very quick way to become an outcast.\n\nThe Reach is one of two kingdoms that does not implement [[Trains]] within its borders. Unlike the other kingdom who does not implement [[Trains]], [[The Ward]], The Reach does use [[Iron Light]]. They merely have not implemented the infrastructure. The [[Artificers]] of [[The Glassius Reach]] are behind in terms of advancements due to the isolation they face.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nAcademics and magic are exclusively taught through [[The Eelynn]], a college of two campuses with one in each city. These schools offer teaching to all youth ages 5-18. Those who are promising academics may go further in their scholarship, pursuing magic and/or greater studies.\n\nThe Reach also has access to a unique manifestation of the will of [[Observance]]. This is obtained through interfacing with [[The Oldshards]]. What little is understood about this phenomena is extremely well guarded and is not known by many. Those who do have abilities granted by [[The Oldshards]] are quite powerful.\n\n## Political Climate\n[[The Glassius Reach]] has faced much destruction in its recent history. The Kingdom has a general hatred for the outside world, especially [[Gethsemane]] and [[Laenwalde]]. The much of the [[The Three Corners]] returns the same sentiment. The Reach is however a small kingdom compared to its enemies, so it remains well defended in its borders.\n\nThe City of [[Yorn et Gaul]] faces a grim present. [[The Apex]], an object central and holy to the city was lost in the [[Western War]]. However the importance of this object was so great to these people. They still worship the grounds where it was once held. They leave much of their holy buildings in their war-torn state as a remined of what they faced. Many seek to restore what was lost while others feel that the kingdom needs to change to adapt to the new world.\n\nRecently, some [[Changelings]] within the city of [[Yorn et Gaul]] are born without the ability to alter their form. Many think this is due to the loss of [[The Apex]].\n\n## Military\nThe kingdom has a comparatively small military, but there is no other army who would so willingly die for its kingdom. [[The Glassius Reach]] stood its ground for extended battles many times during the [[Western War]] despite having loosing numbers. This is due to the highly defensible position, and extremely hostile environment that does not favor outsiders. It also helps that [[Changelings]] can appear as their foes for ambush attacks. The kingdom has a relatively small navy as well, but they are not very vulnerable to sea based attacks due to the rough seas near Zhal.\n\n## Borders\nThe Reach borders the kingdom of:\n- [[Gethsemane]] via the [[Wrath Wastes]]\n\nIt also borders the wilds of:\n- [[The Blades]] mountain range\n- [[The Peaks of Myth'ira]]\n- [[Holyfield]]\n\nand has its coast on:\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n\n## Mimics\n[[The Glassius Reach]] is not only home to the [[Changelings]], but it is also home to the strange, and powerful [[Mimics]]. An ancient and mysterious society of beings who have a vested interest in [[The Oldshards]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.918234134Z","tags":null},"/The-Golden-Council":{"title":"The Golden Council","content":"see [[The Taming of the Badlands]], or [[Heliodor]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.918234134Z","tags":null},"/The-Grand-Nothing":{"title":"The Grand Nothing","content":"![[The Grand Nothing.jpg]]\n\nWhat was left in the wake of the destruction of [[Old Zol]], the lands that holds the secret of what once was. A seemingly infinite expanse that stretches as far as the eye can see. Located over 20 thousand feet below sea level, [[The Grand Nothing]] was thought to be a bottomless, cloud-filled void at the time of [[The Awakening]]. This emptiness was titled [[The Grand Nothing]], a sort of *misnomer* as it only became widely known what laid below much later on.\n\nThe nature of what produced [[The Grand Nothing]] is not known, but it is widely accepted that it was created during [[The Undoing]]. Be it the will of gods, or an evil attack on [[Zol]], the region exists in a sort of pseudo-destroyed state. There are many ways the ruin of the old world displays itself:\n- The **strangely low altitude of this region**, and **mostly flat topography** makes it seem like an unimaginably large portion of land was moved, but **its surface is not wholly flat**. In fact **it possesses some significantly wild topography in areas such as The Baradan Canyon**. \n  Scholars have not been able to divine a geological process that would have produced this since [[The Awakening]]. I**t is thought either some sort of magic created them or the destruction was not so simple.**\n- **The border of [[The Grand Nothing]] is shaped like a parabolic arc**, with its vertex located somewhere near [[Holocene]] within the Windswept Grove.\n- **Old structures in the region have been found containing valuable information about [[Old Zol]].** Time has seemingly done a number on these structure as they are very weathered, but they are also damaged in odd ways, possibly caused by the undoing. Some structures have evidence of burn marks made by both fire and acid, other structures are rotated oddly like the land they were set upon was warped somehow, and glass windows were shattered into tiny cubes.\n- **Any piece of text found within ruins is enciphered, and distorted.** Each discovered morsel of writing is altered differently from its peers, making decryption very complicated and requires a technique called 'Brute [[Divination]]'. This text is often referred to as [[Nullity Text]].\n\nDespite the desolation it once faced, [[The Grand Nothing]] is now a vibrant and wild place populated with odd beasts and monsters. Some creatures have adapted to live in the region, while others present are believed to predate [[The Awakening]]. \n\nExplorers, nomads, and bandits have taken to the region in a similar manner to other wilds across [[The Three Corners]]. Originally only by way of [[Teleportation Circles]] were individuals able to travel to the region with any consistency. Even flying is too dangerous due to violent updrafts that blow up the sheer cliffs, caused by errant winds blown in from [[The Storm Horizon]]. However, [[Gilligan's Lift]], a wonder of engineering was constructed during the very late first age allowing for many to brave the expanse.\n\nThere are other rumored ways down:\n- A set of narrow stairs supposedly carved into the cliff\n- Cave systems that lead out into the region and back up to the surface\n- Secret magical portals hidden within the campuses of the various academic institutions of [[The Three Corners]].\nHowever their existence is probably just that, a rumor.\n\nThose who do make it to the surface of [[The Grand Nothing]] usually travel around by way of [[Skimmers]]. A high speed vehicle with appearance similar to some [[Airships]]. Rather than massive ships that fly high in the sky, [[Skimmers]] hover only a few feet above the ground and travel at extremely high velocity.\n\n[[The Grand Nothing]] is a vibrant land of battles between bandits who scorn society, fearsome nomads, powerful monsters, and explorers who seek the truth of [[The Undoing]].\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **[[Gilligan's Lift]]** - The link between society and [[The Grand Nothing]]. A massive lift the size of a building that carries people to and from the region.\n- **The Blowdown** - A forest grown of plant and fungi that has blown down from the forests of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n\t- **Freshpool** -  lake of fresh water that collects in the center of the forest. One of the only bodies of water that does not fill from the seas above.\n- **The Evrodian Conflux** - A wide conflux of rivers fed by [[The North Sea]]. Interspersed with jungle islands.\n- **The Baradan Canyon** - A winding, complex desert canyon of deep red-orange stone patterned with vibrant blue strata.\n\t- **Canyon Deep** - A wide river of ocean run off that spans the southern mapped regions\n\t\t- **The Cracks** - A series of deep valleyed rivers that feed into Canyon Deep\n- **The Belowcean** - A ginormous hole in the center of the mapped region that leads deep into [[The Underdark]]. If one were to follow the flow of water they would discover a massive underground ocean filled with strange fish and horrid monsters. Expeditions of this region have been very unsuccessful.\n- **Wiseman's Fear** - A region of volcanic activity supposedly cursed by the gods themselves.\n- **Oceanfalls** - The many waterfalls at the seas' edges that pour over into [[The Grand Nothing]]. It is a mystery as to how the draining of water into [[The Grand Nothing]] effects sea levels. Despite the massive volumes that pour over its edge, the seas never drain. Some believe it is because the ocean is infinite, others think it is the will of [[Ohlit]].\n\t- **Ze'mynan Falls**\n\t- **Wakefalls**\n\t- **Mistmaker Falls**\n\t- **Evrodian Falls**\n\t- **Narrow Falls**\n\t- **Widefalls**\n  There are many more of these falls all along the ever spanning cliffs. These are just the ones within the mapped region.\n- **Ruin Sites** - Explorers, academics, and clergy have sought answers of the past all over [[Zol]]. Few sites have told us as much as the following:\n\t- **Site Herran** - A series of standing monuments. Discovered by a team of lead by Archeologist Emzarae Herran. These monuments, and the little text contained upon them gave most of the information of how ancient people viewed the [[Gods]].\n\t- **Site Litiom** - The most notable site of the three. A massive buried tower that is though to be the home of a farmer who owned a small collection of books. Discovered by a team of lead by Archeologist Albun Litiom, this site contained many texts, and scrolls that have all been deciphered, and contain the majority of the information we know about the way of life in [[Old Zol]]. \n\t- **Site Runemaker** - An temple that is almost entirely destroyed. Discovered by hobbyist adventurer Yike Runemaker, this site contains many relief carvings depicting great cities, heroes, landscapes and wars. Due to its artistic nature scholars can only speculate their significance, but this site is where most of the myths and legends people tell of [[Old Zol]] come from. It is difficult for scholars to access during modern days because of its proximity to Camp Ikas.\n  There are many more small ruin sites all over [[The Grand Nothing]], but the majority have given little information about the past.\n- **Camp Ikas** - A bandit camp headed by Damian Ikas. A once great hero of Zol, now turned tyrant against the kingdoms. The bandits here are known to reject society and are avoided at all costs.\n- **Camp Ger'zar** - A remote camp of violent, and chaotic bandits. They pose a threat to explorers in the region as they are known for hunting in packs of [[Skimmers]]. However they are extremely unorganized and feral, so they do not posses the power to tear down the institutions of society.\n- **The Drifting Isles** - A flock of magical floating islands that hover above [[The Grand Nothing]]. They suddenly drifted in one day during the early second age and have stayed ever since. They arrange themselves like a giant arrow with its point above the far eastern reaches of The Baradan Canyon. They float around, bump into each other, and rotate places. Some rare islands even have magically endless sources of water on them that baffle academics. The space covered by these islands widens out the further you get from the tip of the arrow, and reach all the way to the horizon. Explorers frequent these islands in search of treasures and secrets, but most of them are just small jungles populated by flying critters, and the occasional tribe of [[Kobolds]] that have moved in.\n\t- **The Shaded Stretch**\n\t\t- The area beneath The Drifting Isles. Notable only because the possible rock falls pose a danger.\n- **The Edgeless Deserts and The Shallow Seas** - what lies beyond the mapped edges of [[The Grand Nothing]]. Most of the region that is accessible to [[Zol]] is only possible because of The Belowcean draining. Much of what is known to lie beyond is an ocean that is only a few dozen feet deep, interspersed with small desert islands.\n\t- **The Shallow Coast**\n\t\t- The closest edge of the Shallow Sea to main land [[Zol]].\n\t\t- Explored by brave and strange sailors and pirates who seek what lies beyond the horizon\n\n## Climate\nThe region varies from temperate to dry desert. it is worth noting that days within much of [[The Grand Nothing]] are shorter because of the massive cliffs in the west that block out the sun. During the night, the region becomes very cold.\n\n## History and Inhabitants\nTo ask the true history of [[The Grand Nothing]] is to ask the greatest mystery within [[The Three Corners]] of Civilization. What event evoked [[The Undoing]]? What was the world like before the destruction? Why does its desolation manifest in such a strange way?\n\nThe answers to the questions are still almost entirely a mystery, but there are a few known facts and a vast pile of speculation. The known **facts** about [[The Grand Nothing]] and [[Old Zol]] are:\n- There used to be **a once great society, with kingdoms, magic, and technology so grand** they make modern day [[Zol]] seem almost primitive.\n- **[[The First Tongue]] was well known and understood. There were hundreds of [[Wordbearer]]s in [[Old Zol]].** These individuals were considered to be the highest honor of heroes.\n- **Magic and science was masterfully understood** to a degree far beyond what modern [[Zol]] possesses.\n- **There were large scale wars in the stories of the old world**. It is not known if these were real or not, but they seemed to bear some great significance.\n\nThe most prominent **speculations** of [[The Grand Nothing]] and [[Old Zol]] are:\n- **There were only [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]] within the old world**, and the newer races were a product of [[The Undoing]]. This is speculated because no evidence of other races has been found. It has stemmed problematic beliefs such as [[Great Magic]], [[The Triumvirate]], human sovereigntists and things of the like.\n- **It is thought that the area of [[The Grand Nothing]] closest to [[The Three Corners]] was a very rural or possibly even remote place relative to pre-undoing civilization**. Anthropologists believe based on the nature of found ruins that **there may be a great lost city somewhere out in the shallow seas**, as the surviving locations would have likely required some form of nearby infrastructure to function long term. However this is largely speculation.\n- **Old society may have had a very close relationship with the [[Gods]].** The ways in which they are mentioned in deciphered texts make it seem like they walked amongst the people of the old world.\n\nIn modern day, the only people to exist within [[The Grand Nothing]] are those who ventured there. After [[The Undoing]], there were no sapient beings within the region, at least near [[The Three Corners]] that are known of.\n\n## Borders\nThe region borders the cliffs of:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]\n\n## Other Info\n- Magical Relics found within [[The Grand Nothing]] are known as [[Archaisms]]. They are all some product of [[Imbuement Perpetuum]], and most posses very strange traits.\n- The corrupted text found within [[The Grand Nothing]] is known as [[Nullity Text]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.921234149Z","tags":null},"/The-Great-Wall-of-Roots":{"title":"The Great Wall of Roots","content":"The barrier that exists between [[Zol]] and [[The Cosmos]].

Diverse groups of closely knit individuals travelling from city to city via long convoys of caravans. No other nomadic tradition has been able to survive as long as [[The Hatiat]]. This is because their traditions are best suited to survive [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]]. There are many aspects to Hatiatan Tradition which make it distinct, but the aspects which specifically lend themselves to [[The Hatiat]]'s resilience are what have made it so significant.\n\n## Culture of Resilience\nMost nomadic traditions die off or disband within a few generations. [[The Hatiat]] are unique as they have remained despite the challenges of nomadic life. Their culture makes up almost all of nomadic history within [[The Three Corners]]. Many nomadic groups will often start under another name, but eventually convert to Hatiat as it is considered the safest way to live as a nomad. This effect has made [[The Hatiat]] synonymous with the term nomad. That's not to say that there aren't other nomadic cultures, just none so well founded. [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]] make life outside of cities harsh and unhospitable, however [[The Hatiat]] have developed a way to protect themselves, and lead life fulfilling lives.\n\nScholars Credit these 6 common traits amongst Hatiatan Caravans as the primary reasons for the culture's resilience.\n- **Reliance on and Reverence of Cities** - The safest places within [[Zol]] are its cities. The Hatiat recognize this, so all of their journeys are focused on travelling from city to city. [[The Hatiat]] will set up camp outside of the city, living there for weeks or months at a time. They will conduct trade, and work for coin within the civilized regions of the world.\n- **Authority Structure** - Caravans are lead by a single individual known as a **Wheelweather**. The role is gained by being selected by the previous Wheelweather. Wheelweathers are often known as being wise, worldly, intelligent, well respected, and well loved by their caravan. Typically they are at least halfway through their expected lifespan, but usually much older. Aiding the Wheelweather in their task are known simply as **Wheels**. The Wheelweather typically appoints one Wheel for every 9 people in a caravan. They also have the right to remove said role if need be.\n- **Vigils** - Caravans cannot travel if they do not have protection. Vigils are individuals who posses the means to fight off [[The Dangers of the Wilderness]], and protect the caravan. Caravans usually will not travel if they do not have 1 vigil for every 9 members, with a minimum of 3 vigils. One can be both a Vigil and a Wheel/Wheelweather.\n- **Political Neutrality and Favored Reputation** - One of the major tenants of Hatiatan culture is caravan members are not allowed to push back against religious, moral, or political cultures held within a city. [[The Hatiat]] see themselves as guests within each city. This makes many members uncomfortable, but it is what gained The Hatiat their favored reputation across [[The Three Corners]]. They are seen as unproblematic traders who come to their city, brining commerce and good fortune. However not every city sees [[The Hatiat]] in a good light. They are largely disliked in:\n\t- [[Jerda'll]]\n\t- [[Little Triumph]]\n\t- The entirety of [[The Glassius Reach]]\n\t- [[Hoss]]\n\t- [[Mod Dranor]]\n- **Merchant Trade** - [[The Hatiat]] are known for their excellent merchants. The caravans will travel the world, gathering rare goods, information, and treasures. The trade of these goods are what keep a caravan going.\n- **Taith, Toth, and Tarth** - Joining/Leaving a Hatiatan caravan is surprisingly simple. This allows for people to join caravans with little hassle. A larger caravan is a stronger caravan. The events of joining/leaving a caravan are marked with ceremonies. These ceremonies have great significance amongst Hatiatan Tradition. \n\t- Joining with a caravan is known as **Taith**. One can approach a caravan and request to be tried for **Taith**. One of the Caravan's Wheels, or Wheelweather, will ask them a series of questions in front of an audience composed of caravan members. These questions differ with each **Taith**. The questions are often of a moral nature. If the individual passes the trial, and the caravan has the resources to accommodate them, they gain membership.\n\t- **Toth** is the leaving of a caravan. It is a solemn event. It is initiated by a caravan member telling one of their leaders that they intend to disband. It is a rare, and usually occurs when the caravan is stopped at a city. The caravan gathers round the individual who intends to depart, and they share their goodbyes. Then the individual will give the caravan a gift. This gift is not required to be of any specific value, but in Hatiatan Tradition the more sentimental, the better. However, many will also give coin, as running a caravan has a significant cost. If someone does not have anything to give, it is customary for them to gift the caravan the road dust from their boots. A symbol of their journey.\n\t- **Tarth** is the ceremony which marks an exile from the caravan. It is a dark thing within Hatiatan Tradition that is not often spoken of. If a member of the caravan betrays their group, they are branded with the symbol of a broken wheel. A circle with a much smaller circle in its center. The two circles are bridged by 6 lines representing the spoke of a wheel. One spoke for each of the kingdoms. The part of the outer circle between the first and second spoke are missing, representing the break in the wheel. It appears almost like a sliced pie, with a single piece removed. A person marked with this symbol is not allowed to even approach any Hatiatan Caravan in the future. Beyond that, most cultures around [[The Three Corners]] view [[The Hatiat]] with great favor, so those marked with the broken wheel are often not seen in the best light. Some caravans see this as the worst fate, so the will kill their traitors rather than conducting this ceremony.\n\n## Other Aspects of Hatiatan Culture\nBeyond their resilient culture, [[The Hatiat]] have many other traditions. They are known for their family-like bonds between caravan members, their songs, their art, their freedom of expression and religion (when not in a city that merits hiding those behaviors), and their food. Those who are part of [[The Hatiat]] typically join because want to see the world, have no where else to go, or were born into the lifestyle. This stimulates a diverse, and passionate culture. Each Caravan is distinct in their specific cultures, and demeanor in the same way that every family is distinct. Caravans will often identify themselves with a name and symbol.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.93523422Z","tags":null},"/The-Hooded-Presence":{"title":"The Hooded Presence","content":"*Wayward God of Shadows, Minor Deity*\n![[The hooded presence.png]]\n\nThe [[Fell]] god of deception, espionage, and trickery.

With their goal being to be to *harvest* the cosmic power held within [[The Trinity]].\n\nTheir strategy largely relied on the strength and surprise of their initial attack, continued by growing their forces with their parasitic nature. This strategy may have worked for them in the long run, if not for the fact that they chose to attack [[Kapesh]] initially.\n\nTheir goal involved stealing large conduits of [[Viridescence]], the primal power of [[Zol]]. It apparently has immense value amongst [[The Cosmos]].\n\nThe [[Illithids]] took [[Stigmata]] as their base of operations, and converted many [[Humans]] to [[Illithids]]. These new [[Illithids]] were originally subservient to the invaders, but their human stubbornness resurfaced in their personality over time.\n\nBecause of this, the [[Illithids]] faced a great deal of in-fighting and discordance amongst their ranks. The converted humans tried to seize power for themselves. This ultimately left the invaders open to attacks.\n\n[[Wordbearers]] and a large scale force managed to nearly wipe them all out in a single week once the effort was coordinated. Many [[Illithids]] fled to [[The Cosmos]] or hid in dark corners of [[Zol]]. Those that did not flee were captured and interrogated.\n\n## Aftermath\nThe captured Illithids were interrogated for information about the attack. It turned out that they were a small, unremarkable force from wastelands of a place they called [[The Space Outside Reality]].\n\nMuch of what is known about [[The Cosmos]], [[The Space Outside Reality]], [[Illithids]], [[Goh'zul]], and the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]] comes from these interrogations.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.93523422Z","tags":null},"/The-Immortal-Ocean":{"title":"The Immortal Ocean","content":"*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nThe Skyless Sea.

[[The Iron Father]], also known as *Grimnore*, is a one of [[The Wandering Gods]]. His influence is said to be fierce and direct. He carries the moral of dedication, and his followers have been known to fight and die for their causes.\n\n## Depiction\nA massive Dwarf whos body seems to be partially made of metal and fire. His burning red hair flows endlessly and is often depicted hammering at an anvil.\n\n## Moral\n[[The Iron Father]] teaches the moral of dedication. His scripture speaks of cause and effect. When one dedicates themselves wholly to a cause, their effect follows suit. Life will pose trials and tribulations and will push one away from their cause, but it is in these moments true strength can be forged.\n\n## Associations\n[[The Iron Father]] is associated with:\n- [[Dwarves]]\n\t- Note that the [[Dwarves]] of [[Mod Dranor]] worship the [[Zolaen Gods]] and [[Bethar]]. This cultural influence over millennia has stretched far beyond the dwarven city. This makes Dwarven followers of [[The Iron Father]] a minority. This  difference of religion sparks social issues amongst dwarves. \n- Smithing\n- Fire\n- Song\n\t- Specifically dwarven chant\n\n## Realm\nWithin [[The Unknown Realm]], [[The Iron Father]]'s domain is said to be one of stone and flame. A deep cavern located on the side of a mountain. Its halls are formed of carved stone and flowing rock. In the heart of his domain lies a forge of epic proportion.\n\n## Behavior\n[[The Iron Father]]'s influence is said to be a guiding, but firm hand. Known not only to give guidance, but reprimand in times of weakness. However this reprimand is not to punish, but to remind one of the importance of the path the have set themselves upon.\n\n## Worshipers\n[[The Iron Father]]'s followers are people of great intention. These individuals seek to fulfil not just a simple goal, but a needed role in the world. Many are smiths, but they come in all shapes and sizes.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.93723423Z","tags":null},"/The-Iron-Tracks":{"title":"The Iron Tracks","content":"*What unites us*\n![[The Great Tracks.png]]\n\n## Construction\nThe Great Iron Tracks are a wonderous feat of engineering. Designed by the combined efforts of [[The University]], [[Kerketh Academy]] and [[The Kybis Assembly]]. A complex combination of [[Iron Light]] and infrastructure that spans [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. A network of [[Trains]] that allows for anyone, powerful or not, to cross [[Zol]].\n\nOriginally conceptualized for the purpose of unifying the people of [[Zol]]. Allowing for common folk to cross the too-dangerous wilds with ease. This vision was met with resistance from the more conservative members of society. However, even they could not deny the immense economical benefits it would create.\n\nThe design and production of engines was given to the city of [[Rails]] due to its central location. The cities name becoming the nickname for the tracks the [[Trains]] ran on. Their blueprints coming from [[Artificers]] from [[Kerketh Academy]].\n\nDroves of workers and garrisons had to perform long and drawn out missions to construct railways between cities. Monsters and beasts of the wilds would attack the workers daily. The only reason so many did the labor was the high wages for rail workers and security detail.\n\n## Modern Function\nIn the current day and age, the [[Trains]] are integral to society. Moving exports and passengers of all types. The trains themselves are quite wide, with a typical car having the dimensions of 20ft by 80ft. They move at a high velocity any creature or structure in their path is typically obliterated.\n\nRunning on the power of [[Nodes]] in a state of [[Space]], drawing them in at the nose of the train and converting them into motion. The operation of the complex [[Apparatum]] is performed by a conductor. The [[Iron Light]] configurations used in most trains causes a reaction which makes the engine become extremely cold. If an engine gets too cold it can damage, and possibly ruin it. To combat this, trains use simple coal fire engines to keep the engines hot.\n\nThere is a monetary cost for using the [[Trains]], either as a passenger or using them for transporting goods. In either case, there is a spectrum of services all at different costs. This allows for even the less fortunate to use [[The Iron Tracks]] if they are able to save for it.\n\nThe [[Trains]] move hundreds of cars long night and day. In almost all cases the tracks run outside of a cities walls, stopping at a local station. Their incoming is felt as rumbling earth, and a distinct humming sound.\n\n## Notable Exceptions\nSome cities, or kingdoms do not use [[The Iron Tracks]]. Be it religious beliefs, geographical location, or cultural differences.\n- [[The Ward]] does not use [[The Iron Tracks]] because of their disallowance of [[Apparatum]] for religious reasons.\n- [[The Glassius Reach]] is not included in [[The Iron Tracks]] due to political differences and recent war.\n- [[Gethsemane]] only has a single train station in [[Mod Dranor]]. This is largely because of Xenophobia.\n- [[Heliodor]] has a station nearby located on the ground where individuals can take [[Airships]] to the city.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.938234236Z","tags":null},"/The-Isles-of-AlKehtal":{"title":"The Isles of Al'Kehtal","content":"*The Island City of Pirates*\n![[Isles of Al Kehtal.png]]\n\nBuilt from the remains of ships torn asunder by waves or combat, [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] is a haven for the pirates of [[The Three Corners]]. It is a city where all ships and crews must set aside rivalries, lay down their arms to do trade, resupply, and have a drink. There is no King, or Queen of [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]]. However there is a ruling body known as The Furled Sail Council, made up of the most influential captains amongst the community, lead by the Lord Captain. This group operates under a very flexible, but important ruleset. No one has a record of when it started, or who wrote the original rules but [[The Code]] binds all pirates.\n\nThe city is broken up into three main islands:\n\n## Port Keep\n![[port_keep.png]]\n\nThe North East Island. Port Keep is the central hub for the island, and the meeting place for The Furled Sail Council. It is the smallest island of the city, and few have any real reason to go here.\n\n## Flotsam\n![[flotsam.png]]\n\nThe South East Island. The largest of the islands. Flotsam is a place of trade, and has the most permanent homes. Its island also has a great deal of natural jungle on it, providing resources for the city.\n\n## Jetsam\n![[jetsam.png]]\n\nThe West Island. The busiest part of the city. Jetsam is the place all pirates think of when looking for a place to plan, plot, repair, rest, fight, fuck, dine, and drink. It is an ugly, dirty, and crowded place. It is impossible for a pirate not to love. Many of its districts are heavily associated with some groups of pirates, and it is important to know where you are going. Lest you find yourself in an place where you are not welcome.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] are a lawless, exciting, and strange place. Here, pirates can conduct any and all business they wish without the laws of Kingdoms or the threat of getting stabbed in the back thanks to [[The Code]]. |\n| Main Challenge | [[The Code]] serves as a bare minimum legal structure for the city, and it is indeed that. There is no policing force, all laws are upheld by the people of the city. Any enforcement is done by hired muscle, or loyal crew members. Crime is a constant in its streets, but its in its consistency the pirates find order. |\n| Climate | Tropical |\n| Cuisine | Fish, Wild game, imported food |\n| Export | Black Market Trade |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| None |\n| City Leader | Lord Captain Kaskoe Kollik |\n| Primary Language(s) | None |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Followers of [[Ohlit]], [[Ellyon and Aradon]], [[Agon and Ra'Queen]], [[Cadence]] |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Island |\n| Architecture | Ramshackle structures formed of local materials and pieces of shipwrecks |\n| Color(s) | None |\n| Symbolism | Skull and Crossbones |\n| Defenses | Extremely high concentration of pirates |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group               | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Furled Sail Council | Rank         | The captains of the most influential crews. One can only be brought into the council by invitation from more than half of the council, or by inheriting the spot from a superior that noted you as their successor. Overseeing this group is the Lord Captain. A title given by popular vote amongst council members. This rank gives an individual 2 votes, and ties go in favor of the Lord Captain. This seems like a small thing, but votes frequently reach an even split. This makes having the Lord Captains favor an extremely important thing. The trickle down effect from this paves the way for the whole power struggle amongst pirates. |\n| Gilded              | Rank         | Those recognized as important enough by the council to receive a gilded crest. These crests come with a whole cast of benefits such as better deals for repairs on ships, supplies, and taxes on trades. They also mark you and an influential person amongst pirates. This status means actions you take may have more sever consequences by [[The Code]]. Rivalries you make, battles you partake in, and treasure you hunt will likely have an effect on the greater community of pirates. If you do things that could damage the way of life for pirates, there are severe consequences.                                                                           |\n| Goons               | Rank         | The average pirate.

To most, [[The Korus Arctic]] is a place that exists within story. Tales of colossal monsters formed of ice, tribes of fearsome yeti, and ice that is so cold it will steal the magic out of even the most powerful of mages. While the tales of its majesty inspire fear and wonder, they are not often far from the truth.\n\nNo place within [[The Three Corners]] is said to feel so remote. To even reach the arctic is a task that most could not surmount. The secrets it hold frozen within its ice are still yet to be truly uncovered.\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **The Pinepatch Hills** - Foothills of [[Demodemacht]] covered in various patches of arctic forest\n- **Temple of Isildur** - A monastic temple that focuses on the solitary bond an individual has to [[The Trinity]].\n- **Temple of Shirone** - A monastic temple that focuses on the ability of one's physical body with the belief that there is no upper limit.\n- **The Glassmounts** - Glaciers that seem to stretch on into infinity.

It is littered with deep crevasses that are very treacherous to the few who would navigate them. \n- **The Benumbed Snowfields and The Bleak Walls Beyond** - Past all the beauty and strangeness lies a seemingly endless field of snow, only broken up by massive shelves of ice that form walls thousands of feet high, and stretch from east to west. Supposedly these ice shelves are stacked one on top of the other creating impossibly large step-shaped topography. Venturing this far is next to impossible as the cold continues to grow more intense the further north you travel. At a certain point the cold itself begins to suppress magic. It is made even more dangerous by the influence of the wayward god [[Daetro]], who is known to smite those who tread into his domain.\n\n## Climate\nThe arctic is a tundra that can grow so terrifyingly cold that magic is suppressed, and even extinguished in the far north.\n\n## History and Inhabitants\nFew reside within the region due to the harshness of the climate. Those who do must ensure they are very fit for it lest they face lethal consequences. The few pieces of society that exist are monastic temples that seek disconnection from the material world of [[The Three Corners]].\n\nThere also exists a society of native Yetis in the far north.

[[The Kybis Assembly]] is a place of great knowledge, and strange secrets. It is a very secretive institution, and very difficult to gain admission to. Located within [[Archaic]], the school is so old that it holds many of the records from directly after [[The Awakening]], as it was the first true school that was established.\n\n![[Kybis Assembly.png]]\n\n## Values\n*\"We speak not the language in which truth is written.\"*\n\n[[The Kybis Assembly]] has always sought the secrets of [[Zol]]. It has a long history of trying to crack the secrets of things like [[The Old Tongue]], [[Beast Ire]], and the world lost within [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many stories and rumors of the dark things that go on within [[The Kybis Assembly]] paint a grim picture of it. However the school produces some of the sharpest minds, and the most powerful mages.\n\n## Origin\nThe school was originally founded within the city of [[Archaic]] for the purpose of recompiling the knowledge lost in [[The Undoing]]. It was the first academic institution, and its creation sparked a revolution in [[Zol]].\n\n## Structure\nThe School is not the largest of its kind, but it is known to be one of the most powerful. Their methods of education are dangerous, mysterious, and effective.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- The schools day to day is handled by Insightors, but it is said the true mission of [[The Kybis Assembly]] is decided by The Grand Insightors, if they even exist.\n- ### Size\n\t- The school is around one to tow thousand members, however not all of them are on the schools grounds at one time.\n- ### Rules\n\t- The school is extremely strict, and it of the greatest importance that its members do not share its secrets with outsiders\n- ### Admission\n\t- Getting into the school is extremely difficult. One must send a letter of their own creation, paired with a letter of recommendation. Then they must wait for a communication from the school. Those with promise are invited back to the school for a thorough test. Some tell tales of their test being a normal, verbal examination. While others tell strange stories of being asked to solve unique puzzles, or philosophical questions. If they pass, they may enter the school as long as they can afford the expensive tuition.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for [[Arcana]]. No one knows how this symbol was known by the school for so long before the discovery of [[Iron Light]].\n\n## Academic Stations\n\n| Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Students | Those at the lowest level of education within the Assembly. These students gain entry to the school via very high tuition costs and recommendation letters, or by direct invitation from an Insightor or reputable Preceptor. There is a comradery amongst students but it is usually overshadowed by the competition between peers. Elevated students are given tattoos to mark their status. These markings have secret meanings, but the more markings the higher the station. |\n| Preceptors | The second highest level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are researchers given resources by the academy, and act as the professors of the more entry-level classes. This rank is typically granted when a student has learned a few words of [[The Old Tongue]]. |\n| Insightors | The masters level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are charged with overseeing the daily ins and outs of the Assembly as well as the education of the student body. Acting as the professors for the more high ranking courses these individuals typically know many words of [[The Old Tongue]]. |\n| Grand Insightors | The grand master level within [[The Kybis Assembly]]. These individuals are surrounded by legend and mystery. Some people (even some students) think they do not exist. They are of the most skilled mages within [[Zol]], and their sole responsibility is to seek the deep and eldritch knowledge hidden within the world. It is said these individuals do not even associate with anyone below the rank of Insightor. |\n\n\n## Assets\n- [[The Archives]]\n\t- The largest library in all [[The Three Corners]]\n\n## Relationships\n- The school is considered to be sister schools with [[The College of Hoss]], a very small and similarly mysterious school.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.947234281Z","tags":null},"/The-Lifeweaver":{"title":"The Lifeweaver","content":"*Zolaen God of Nature, Major Deity*\n![[The Lifeweaver.png]]\n\nGod of everything from stone to flesh.

In a less formal setting, worship may be performed in odd naturalistic ways by rural peoples and things of the like.\n\nSome followers worship a single facet of nature in [[The Lifeweaver]]'s name.

Sorrow, Majesty, and Luna.\n\n![[The moons night sky.png]]\n\nThe moons of [[Zol]] are thought to have once been planets that were consumed by [[Goh'zul]] before his defeat. Their previously life-covered surfaces were left to ruin within the stomach of the Great Old One.\n\nNow, the three planets grace [[Zol]] with beautiful illumination during its nights. Their barren landscape has begun to stir with life again as strange beings have made homes there, and ancient things from eons past awaken to the disturbances.\n\n## Sorrow\nThe smallest of the 3 moons. Sorrow is known for its yellow hue and planetary ring. The ruins of Sorrow are the most intact of the 3 moons, and house many treasures and secrets about [[The Cosmos]].\n\nFew bear the power to travel to any of the moons. However those that reach sorrow have met monsters that inhabit its surface making it very dangerous to traverse, but the few who have the capacity and drive to go there quest for its treasure.\n\n## Majesty\nThe second largest of the trio, and the brightest of the trio. The Desert Moon. Majesty's surface is covered with vast dunes of white sand. While originally thought to be barren, it was discovered that deep below its surface lies caves full of valuable mineral resources.\n\nGreat expeditions have been made by powerful arcanists in the past to harness these resources. Unfortunately, these were rarely met with success as the planet is inhabited by colossal omnivorous worms.\n\nMajesty also has a large shadow that passes over its surface in a regular pattern. This makes the moon appear in different phases like: full, half, crescent and new. No one knows the exact nature of this ever flowing shadow, but it is central to many myths and legends. \n\n## Luna\nThe largest of the three moons, The Shifting Fate. Luna has strange properties that baffle scholars to this day. Its stony, crater-covered surface warps and changes with each passing day.\n\nDuring the late [[First Age]], academics noticed that they could predict the likelihood of incoming gales from [[The Storm Horizon]] based on the positions of craters on Luna's surface.\n\nAfter monitoring it for many years, academics noticed patterns when comparing it to historical data. The noticed relationships with things like the economy, plagues, crop harvest, and even the rise and fall of fashion trends amongst nobility.\n\nAcademics have yet to devise a consistent way to predict the meanings of Luna's surface beyond the storms, and may never do so. Some [[Witches]] claim to be able to read her surface, but do not divulge their techniques, nor provide proof.\n\n## The Forgotten Heavens\nAmongst these three planets, a single divine realm is shared. [[The Forgotten Heavens]], a place once abandoned like the moons were, now homes one of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[The Night Empress]] resides in the strange and celestial plane where she watches all who move under the light of [[The Moons]].\n\n## Orbital patterns\nSorrow and Majesty orbit Luna. Luna herself remains stationary in [[Zol]]'s sky during night and day. [[The Moons]] are faint in comparison to [[The Sun]] during the day, but vibrant and bright during the night.\n\nOccasionally, [[The Sun]] will pass behind the moons, causing an eclipse.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.951234302Z","tags":null},"/The-Mortal-Coil":{"title":"The Mortal Coil","content":"The force that bonds a soul to a vessel, and disjoins them upon death.\n\n![[the mortal coil.png]]\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is a primal force that exists in [[Zol]], it is what causes things to live and die. Some think it is an effect of the way [[The First Tongue]] bound the [[Sea of Monsters]], making it part of [[The Trinity]]. Others think it is a force of its own.\n\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is maintained by [[The Coilwalker]]. Some think that he is its reason for its existence, others think him to be an avatar of its greater will. Regardless of what controls [[The Mortal Coil]], its power effects every being in [[Zol]], living or dead.\n\n## The Rules of The Mortal Coil\n[[The Mortal Coil]] is bound to a specific set of rules that determine the function of life and death across all [[Planes]] of [[Zol]].\n- Beforelife\n\t- little is known of the Beforelife, but it is thought that souls grow freely from [[Nodes]] in [[The Ethos]]. These souls are selected at random by [[The Mortal Coil]] to be bound to vessels. This binding begins Life.\n\t- Souls in this state are thought to be non-sentient, and only become true beings when they are bound to a vessel at the moment of birth.\n\t\t- This is not the case for souls that are sent for rebirth after death. In this scenario, the souls-to-be-reborn are considered comatose beings in a state of pseudo-life. \n- Life\n\t- Life begins when a vessel is fully created and a soul is bound to it. This can manifest in a number of ways\n\t\t- Successfully completed reproduction\n\t\t\t- A soul is only attached when a reproductive creature fully forms a child that successfully hatches, or is birthed\n\t\t- Homunculum\n\t\t\t- The creation of an artificial vessel fit enough for a soul to enter it\n\t\t\t- This can manifest in many ways\n\t\t\t\t- A clone of a being is made via magic\n\t\t\t\t- elemental forces are bent to house a soul\n\t\t\t\t- [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]\n\t\t\t\t\t- A newly discovered method of creating life where a complex enough creation of [[Iron Light]] is made and it becomes sentient.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is how beings like [[Warforged]] come to life\n\t\t- Divine Creation\n\t\t\t- When one of the [[Gods]] directly uses their power to create a vessel and injects a soul into it\n\t\t- Natural Spawn\n\t\t\t- When the natural world of [[Zol]] produces a being on its own\n\t- Life cannot begin on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, except for the case of Divine Creation where a powerful enough god manually seeks out a soul for the vessel.\n- Death\n\t- Death occurs when enough damage afflicts the system that maintains life. This can appear as\n\t\t- Damage to the vessel so great it cannot sustain a soul\n\t\t- Damage to the bond between a vessel and soul so great it causes them to separate\n\t\t- Damage to the soul so great it destroys the soul\n\t\t\t- This is the rarest death, as the soul is nigh indestructible. If this occurs there is no way to bring the being back to life.\n\t- If Death does occur, there are cases where magic can be used to restore life, given that the circumstances are correct.\n\t\t- If one does successfully restore life, the being will return with a scar from [[The Mortal Coil]] called a Mortality Rune. A single instance of this creates one, but multiple restorations chain these markings in a line. ![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\t- Death cannot occur on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, save for the case of a soul being destroyed. A death off the mortal coils usually results in banishment to [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]], the [[Prime Material Plane]], or the plane from which they originated. They arrive on the brink of death. This is not always the case as some planes like [[Absurdia]] have their own rules about death off of [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- Something that is defined as ***Immortal*** is not killed by old age, and can withstand colossal amounts of trauma to their vessel, soul, and the bond between them without succumbing to death.\n\t\t- Any living thing can die so long as it is under the full effect of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t\t- This principal is why the [[Gods]] spend most of their time outside of [[The Mortal Coil]], as it gives them much security from other powerful beings who would see them dead.\n\t\t- There is also a theory that the mortal coil weakens extremely powerful beings like [[Gods]]. Some think this is why the [[Zolaen Gods]] do not grace [[The Prime]].\n- Afterlife\n\t- When death occurs, the soul (if intact) leaves the vessel. It is then guided by [[The Coilwalker]] to a new phase of existence based on the way the soul acted in its lifetime.\n\t- The paths a soul can take are:\n\t\t- Rest\n\t\t\t- If one of the [[Gods]] takes a liking to a given soul, the may be brought to stay with them outside [[The Mortal Coil]]. A peaceful eternity amongst kindred spirits.\n\t\t\t- If no god claims it, and the soul is unfit for rebirth or punishment. It is sent to [[Apolyatum]].\n\t\t- Rebirth\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth are sent back into [[The Ethos]] for their soul to be randomly selected for life again. If this occurs they are reborn with small slivers of their past lives interwoven into their being.\n\t\t\t- Slivers of past lives stay with souls, but are largely born without an sense of past life.\n\t\t\t\t- Powerful [[Magic]] investigation can expose truths about past lives.\n\t\t\t- Many things can spark rebirth. Magical influence, the will of a god, or even if the soul itself truly seeks it.\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth many times often go on to do great things.\n\t\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t\t- If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul, they are sent to limbo to undergo some trial.\n\t\t\t\t- Each trial varies for each soul\n\t\t\t\t- Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution\n\t\t\t\t- The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death\n\t\t- Punishment\n\t\t\t- If a soul has led a dark life, [[The Coilwalker]] brings it to [[Damnation]] upon death.\n\t\t\t- It is thought that [[The Coilwalker]] struck an accord with [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. This deal allows for [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] to claim some form of power from the deaths of [[Zol]]. In exchange he is to carry out the punishment for souls marked by [[The Coilwalker]].\n\t\t\t- Punishment varies in severity. Sometimes it is a lesser and/or temporary punishment. After which the damned are allowed to reside in [[Apolyatum]], the highest layer of [[Damnation]], the city of the dead.\n\t\t\t\t- Other times it is a more severe, and eternal punishment\n\t\t- [[Obliteration]]\n\t\t\t- If a soul is deemed too dangerous for [[Zol]], [[The Coilwalker]] will send a soul to the lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. A small, dark, and horrible place called [[Obliteration]]. Here, giant beings made from obsidian destroy the souls sent to them with mighty hammers forged by Aldem himself.\n\t\t- Misc\n\t\t\t- Sometimes strange things can happen to souls. \n\t\t\t\t- Some arcanists have claimed to have trapped souls using magic.\n\t\t\t\t- Others believe that some souls go on to become other things like [[Sylfs]].\n\n## Anti-Life\nOccasionally a powerful vessel or soul will exist without its bonded counterpart, and will somehow continue to function in a strange manner akin to Life. There are likely many things that can cause this, but few are known:\n- [[Magical Backfire]]\n- The will of one of the [[Gods]]\n- [[Necromancy]]\n\nThe result is a physical being who acts in one of two ways\n- Echoes\n\t- This occurs when a being survives having its soul severed, and no further will is imposed on it beyond the initial severing\n\t- The resulting being will attempt to continue their \"life\", but they do so without all of their emotions or memories in tact, resulting in strange behavior. Sometimes the physical body of this creature will also become monstrous in appearance.\n\t- Anti-life is reversible for Echoes if a soul can be rebound to its vessel, returning the being to normal Life again.\n- Undead\n\t- Vessels who have fully died, then given an artificial soul, or have their soul reattached via [[Necromancy]].\n\t\t- When a vessel is not under the influence of a soul, it opens the body up to being magically enhanced in ways that would be otherwise impossible.\n\t- This usually creates a being subservient to the will of its souls creator.\n\t- The strength of the resulting being is dependent on the state of the vessel, and the skill of the souls creator.\n\t- These beings are typically more susceptible to further deaths as the bond between vessel and soul is not perfect.\n\t\t- But the severed artificial soul can be easily reattached and sometimes will do so on its own.\n\nBeings who experience Anti-Life are immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]] as they do not age and have greatly increased fortitude in many cases. A [[Lich]] is a being who does this to themselves intentionally, usually to gain immortality to further pursue the dark side of [[Arcana]].\n\n\n## The Mortal Realms\n[[Zol]] has many [[Planes]] of existence that are all anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[The Mortal Coil]]'s influence does not exist in all [[Planes]]. This has an interesting effect on the behavior of life, death, and gods on any plane.\n\nThe [[Planes]] that contain [[The Mortal Coil]] are known as The Mortal Realms:\n- The [[Prime Material Plane]]\n- The [[Fey]]\n- The [[Fell]]\n- [[The Ethos]]\n- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\nDue to this fact, most [[Gods]] rarely enter these [[Planes]] themselves. When they do, they put their life at great risk.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.951234302Z","tags":null},"/The-Narrow-Sea":{"title":"The Narrow Sea","content":"![[The Narrow Sea.png]]\n\nThe smallest of the seas, and most familiar with [[The Three Corners]]' history of warfare.

It is a place of both worship and study. It is a school of the [[Observum]], an extension of [[The University]]. It is a massive sprawling temple of black obsidian and sandstone bricks. Within its grounds, many academics, priests, clerics, sages, monks engage in study, debate and worship. All with the ultimate goal of understanding the nature of the [[Gods]].\n\nMany think the purist a foolish, impossible, or sinful. However, one cannot deny that in the divide that exists between god and mortal lies the greatest of mysteries. Those who study at [[The Obsidian Temple]] are mostly not users of [[Magic]]. This is because the bond to a greater power required for [[Observance]] is not so easily gained. Most are historians, philosophers, and theologians. These individuals are called miesters. Those who can conduct magic by use of [[Observance]] are called practitioners.\n\nThe greatest divides that exist within the school are ones of belief. Many argue about the righteousness of their gods and the missing pieces of [[Zol]]'s history. Education within the school is voluntary. This means one can choose what sermons, classes and lectures they go to. The whole school is funded by The Crown. Food and lodging are supplied by the institution.\n\n[[The Obsidian Temple]] is also located underneath [[Mount Zerstel]], the volcano which is home to the god [[Daetro]]. This close proximity allows for the most tangible interaction with a god anywhere within [[The Three Corners]]. A major resource for the school. However [[Daetro]] is not an open book by any means. There are many records of him answering questions with sentences like \"This is a query for mortals to answer on their own\".\n\n## Admission\nTo join [[The Obsidian Temple]], one must be invited. However requests for entry are often granted if one can make a good enough case for themselves.\n\n## Leadership\nLed by The Elders. A council of members representing each of the major religious groups\n- Zolaen-Centric\n- Trinity-Centric\n- Wanderer-Centric\n- The Church of Daetro, included due to its location in [[Rockfire]]\n- Polytheists/Monotheists\n- Atheists\n- Void Advocates\nThe head leader is chosen by popular vote, and the head cannot be a Void Advocate. The current leader is High Priest Tarsin Gennador, the head of the Zolaen Church within [[Laenwalde]]. An aged human man.

Similar to its parent, The Old Tongue is for lack of a better term, a language. Unlike modern language, The Old Tongue must be spoken with more than just words, and occasionally involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of Common must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The Old Tongue must be spoken with great knowledge, emotion, will, artistry, movement, faith, and a mighty [[Vizir]]. There are words in The Old Tongue, but they are fathoms more complicated than a mere dialect.\n\nThe Old Tongue can be used to harness wonderous [[Magic]] via access to [[The Wills]]. Those who know even a small fragment of it are called [[Speakers]]. Access to this power is rare in [[Zol]], most people encounter only a single Speaker in their lives.\n\n## Usage and Learning\nBinding [[The Wills]] with the power of The Old Tongue is a step above binding them with one's [[Vizir]]. While the former requires great focus, and convincing ones mind of a reality different than that of what is occurring around them, The Old Tongues feels more akin to that of fairy tale magic. Rather than forcing ones will to bleed out into reality, reality naturally bends to fit to ones will. Almost as if it is working as your ally. It is theorized The Old Tongue temporarily re-binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] itself.\n\nLearning The Old Tongue in any capacity changes a person. From their emotions to their very brain structure and physiology. Especially in the case of [[Arcana]]. Many who study in this field lose themselves to madness. Any being that possesses a Vizir may learn The Old Tongue.\n\nAdditionally, learning The Old Tongue does not come from books or lessons like other language. An individual must discover pieces of it on their own, almost like rediscovering forgotten memories. Great practice with one's [[Vizir]] is known to increase the likelihood of discovery, but it is truly found by great willpower, dedication, craft, study, acts of heroism, and even traumatic experiences on occasion. Every individual uses it in a manner unique to themselves.\n\nNo one person knows the entirety of The Old Tongue, and it is thought by some to be boundless. It is only referred to as a language as many [[Speakers]] have described it as such. Due to its nature it is very hard to record. However, [[Speakers]] have discovered a written version of [[The Old Tongue]], and have been able to use it in [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. The runes and diagrams associated with [[The Oldshards]] are called [[Iszertion]], and it is a well kept secret. Even if one was to find it, if the[[The Old Tongue]], the harbor no chance at making sense of [[Iszertion]].\n\nMany also do not wish to share their secrets, as the power takes much to wield, and could do wrong in unprepared hands. Others merely do not want the unworthy to benefit from their hard work.\n\n## Individual Experience\nMany individuals describe their first experience with the Old Tongue as something unlike anything else. It brings you into a state where you feel for first the first time in your life, you are existing fully. A euphoric feeling is said to flood your mind. Your senses and emotions amplify to new heights. Colors are seen in their true forms, the edges of solid objects appear more defined. The air itself is said to feel like a sea flowing all around you, where all movement sends waves that can be felt all across your being. It has been called a 'drug like no other' by some. \n\nEvery account of it has these commonalties, but with a unique difference from person to person. Some say they are able to harness magic in a way only possible during the first encounter. Others say they witness events from the past, future, or other worlds. Some even claim to hear the words of the gods, or strange secrets spoken by [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAfter the feeling leaves, may people are left feeling emotional or lost. The feeling never returns with the same intensity. As one masters their craft in The Old Tongues their normal experience of reality begins to grow closer and closer to that of the first time in a permanent way.\n\nIt is believed that knowing something in The Old Tongue is the first step in learning it in [[The First Tongue]], but this is based more on intuition than fact.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n[[Speakers]] are both revered and feared across [[Zol]]. Many people believe they are the ideal of the sapient world, while others claim they are a large problem to be feared and avoided. The sheer amount of myth and legend alone that revolves around speakers is enough for common folk to acquire very opinionated stances on [[Speakers]].\n\nSome [[speakers]] hide their abilities while others wear it with pride. Sporting special jewelry and clothes to denote their status. Some cultures like that of [[Kapesh]] treat speakers as the highest degree of nobility.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.957234332Z","tags":null},"/The-Old-World-of-Zol-Excerpts-from-The-Grand-Nothing":{"title":"The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from The Grand Nothing","content":"A highly controversial text on the archeological discoveries of [[The Grand Nothing]].

The myriad of people and chaos made for a wild expanse with little to no governing forces. The region was dubbed The Badlands, and few civilized people ventured there.\n\nEventually some groups gained enough power to establish themselves as coherent powers. As more and more of these groups formed, The Badlands became a feudal battleground. Small cities rose and fell constantly, dotting the area with ruins. Some groups rose high enough to gain legitimacy. It was at this point it became politically advantageous for the [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] to support certain parties. They lent aid to the kingdoms of [[Halflings]] and [[Gnomes]] who would go on to conquer and found [[Eucaren]].\n\n[[Eucaren]] was originally on track to be part of [[Gethsemane]], but the [[Elves]] held back, as feared something that lied in [[The East Mounts]]. This development caused the rest of The Badlands to organize in response. The diverse kingdoms of [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]] were founded soon after. These regions fought one another for quite some time. It was clear that [[Eucaren]] was much better off with the aid of [[Gethsemane]]. [[Saen]] had little in terms of resources due to their desert environment, so the made an alliance with [[Arcadia]]. This alliance gave the two regions enough capacity to take [[Eucaren]] from [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThere was a long time of disagreement, but a halfling politician and scholar named Perrial Galanor spent much time writing and speaking to the populations of the three kingdoms. She unified them under their shared history of The Badlands, and sought for separation from the [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] of [[Gethsemane]] due to the their dangerous wars with [[Kapesh]]. The kingdom was named [[Laenwalde]], the gnomish word for perseverance.\n\nPerrial Galanor worked closely with the leaders of [[Eucaren]], [[Saen]] and [[Arcadia]]. They were (respectively) Elrose Virrand a halfling woman, Tyran Urla a half elven man, and Fievar Cardanax a human man. These rulers wrote laws, trade agreements, and policies that would unify the three kingdoms.\n\nAmongst this unification effort, an institution was formed in the city of [[Ryze]]. [[The University]] was made to be an organization that would explore, document, and teach [[The Wills]] of [[Zol]]. These efforts would help bind the people of The Badlands with knowledge and the tools of [[Magic]]. Their mission was directly in line with the efforts of Perrial Galanor, the groups worked together because of this.\n\nWhile in the process of determining how the three would share rulership over [[Laenwalde]], a very high ranking nobleman of human descent entered the political scene. His name was Resh Tatelak. He was a kind hearted and charismatic man who had served in the military during the unification efforts under his brother who was the leader of the Arcadian Military. His reputation, bloodline and disposition made him the ideal king. \n\nThe three leaders along with their advisors eventually decided on an agreement where Resh would be installed as king, and they would bend the knee only to him and remain as the installed rulers of their respective regions.\n\nLaenwalde was founded in the year of 3201 and had three years of glory. The vast majority of its people respected the new rule and the cities profited greatly due to new trade routes and lowered military costs. Many loved King Tatelak and he was seen as the ideal all across [[Zol]]. His advisory council served loyally, now staffed with the best rulers of the regions and the most educated members of [[The University]].\n\nSadly this did not last long. Elrose Virrand was killed by a jealous lover, Tyran Urla fell ill with a mysterious sickness that made him unable to conduct much of his work and reduced his lifespan, and The King himself was accidentally killed breaking up a fight between drunk city guards. This threw [[Laenwalde]] into confusion. The people of the three kingdoms quickly grew anxious and unrest was seen in all classes of people.\n\nThe region was stuck in a halfcocked state, and quickly shifted into chaos. King Resh Tatelak had no succession plan. The unity so many had worked for was on the verge of being lost for good, then Resh Tatelak's brother, Radavar Tatelak, next in line to the throne and leader of the King's army took the region by force despite his relatively legitimate claim.\n\nRadavar was by no means a politician, but was an excellent military leader. Once the kingdoms had their chaos quelled, Radavar took the crown as king of [[Laenwalde]]. He implemented his own version of what was to be his brothers rule, but in a manner that some would argue benefitted him a little too well. He greatly dampened the influence of his brothers advisors and had many done away with. This made for the largest kingdom in all of [[Zol]], under a rule of one specific man.\n\nRadavar's hostile takeover lasted for a few generations (103 years to be exact). His descendants were not nearly as gifted has him in military strategy. Civil war began and the Tatelak Bloodline lost the crown.\n\nMany many generations of political and military infighting occurred in Laenwalde. The kingdom was barely held together at the seams. There were times where alliances of cities broke off, only to later return. The only reason it remained mostly unified to this day as Laenwalde was the same reason it was originally founded: the advisory councils.\n\nThere were 8 major changes that occurred in [[Laenwalde]]'s rule from 3201 to 3812:\n- The Death of Resh Tatelak and succession of Radavar Tatelak, *ann. 3203*\n- The Overthrowing of the Tatelak Rule and the installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3306*\n- The Overthrowing of the Falava Rule and the installation of of the Gnoe Rule, *ann. 3353*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gnoe Rule and the installation of of the Veetro Rule, *ann. 3412*\n- The Penthe-Ryze-Kosskazoka secession and the ensuing Citywar that caused the fall of the Veetro Rule and instilled a complex multi-ruler temporary council, *ann. 3489*\n- The return of Penthe, Ryze and Kosskazoka as well as the installation of the Dax'cro Rule, *ann. 3502*\n- The Ejection of the Dax'cro Rule and the installation of of the Gold Council. A complex organization that served as a group of leaders that would rule as a collective. This group frequently had members change due to a high degree of political drama, espionage and assassination, *ann. 3503*\n- The Overthrowing of the Gold Council and the re-installation of of the Falava Rule, *ann. 3758*\n\nLaenwalde's courts and battlefields were an off-and-on, high-stakes game that came to an abrupt and grim end when [[The Castle of Bodies]] attacked [[Audran]] in the year 3812.\n\nWhen the attack occurred, the Falava Bloodline was killed in its entirety. While gruesome, the attack pushed Laenwalde to unify against a greater threat. When the kingdom was left to recover from its wounds an The Golden Council was reformed and took the burden of rulership. This was only until a descendant of Resh Tatelak himself was discovered in the city of [[Woogis]]. His name was Byrell Tatelak. [[King Tatelak II]] was installed in the year 4259 and the floating bastion of [[Heliodor]] was constructed in the year of 4262.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.967234383Z","tags":null},"/The-Tarot":{"title":"The Tarot","content":"A mystic tradition dating all the way back to [[The Awakening]], originating in the city of [[Zessgorn]].

It views [[Humans]] unfavorably. The theory says that [[Humans]] strayed from the light of the [[Gods]]. As punishment, their longevity (also referred to as [[Great Magic]] in this context) was taken from them. This lost power was fragmented into the [[Off-Human]] races. This theory charges many polarized beliefs in many cultures, and is to blame for many dark parts of history. Including [[Slavery]], unethical arcane practices, and wars like the [[Triumvirate Battles]] or the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. This is the most widely accepted belief regarding [[Great Magic]].\n\n## Kapeshian Triumviratism\nKapeshian Triumviratism theory originated within [[Kapesh]], and was largely founded in [[Ashian]] belief. It views [[Humans]] as a sacrifice in the context of [[The Undoing]]. [[Ashian]] belief says that [[Humans]] fought alongside the [[Zolaen Gods]] against [[The Shroud of the Void]]. In the later stages of the battle, [[The Shroud of the Void]] began to take over the minds of [[Humans]]. So the [[Humans]] willingly gave up their [[Great Magic]], giving the [[Zolaen Gods]] the upper hand to seal the [[Void Gods]] away permanently within [[The Void]].\n\n## Issues with the Theory\nThere are many facts that contest this belief as well which include: longevity in Off-Human races, the fact that most of this is based on very little archeological information, the diverse difference of [[Language]] present after [[The Awakening]], and there being no modern true biological differences in the proficiency of harnessing The Trinity's powers when regarding the races en masse.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.974234418Z","tags":null},"/The-Undari":{"title":"The Undari","content":"See [[Penthe]] and [[Ryze]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.974234418Z","tags":null},"/The-Underdark":{"title":"The Underdark","content":"![[The Underdark.png]]\n\nThe vast nexus of caves the spans underneath [[Zol]].

Luckily, basic skills, names, relationships, and languages were retained giving a better chance at survival. Oddly, a shared language was spoken by all people, the language of Common. It is not known if this was something from [[The Before]], or an artifact of [[The Undoing]].\n\nMuch of [[Zol]] blames [[Humans]] for these consequences. Many believe that [[Humans]] were once one of 3 great races called [[The Triumvirate]]. They were punished most of all during [[The Undoing]]. Theories say they had their [[Great Magic]] fragmented, and longevity taken. From these pieces, the [[Off-Human]] races were formed. These races do not bear the longevity of [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]]. The modern societies of [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] are also far better off than the rest of [[Zol]]'s people. Their long lives giving the ability to gather much knowledge and achieve great things.\n\nEven in modern day, the people of [[Zol]] still beg the [[Gods]] to explain [[The Undoing]]. All [[Gods]] refuse to do so. Some believe that they are actually unable to under magical oath.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.975234423Z","tags":null},"/The-University":{"title":"The University","content":"Those who seek to understand [[The Wills]], the people of [[The Three Corners]], and how the world can be bettered. [[The University]] was founded upon altruistic motives during the later stages of [[The Taming of the Badlands]]. It is comprised of three branches:\n- The [[Arcanum]], which studies the will of [[Arcana]]\n\t- [[The Brass Hall]]\n\t- [[Jhenbridge]]\n- The [[Observum]], which studies the will of [[Observance]]\n\t- [[The Obsidian Temple]]\n\t- [[The First Bastion]]\n- The [[Viridium]], which studies the will of [[Viridescence]]\n\t- [[The Conservatory]]\n\n## Values\n*\"The pursuit of understanding, and the betterment of [[Zol]]\"*\n\n[[The University]] as a whole was a product of a need for understanding the nature of [[The Wills]]. At its heart, the organization seeks to educate and draw conclusions about the mysteries of [[Zol]]. This manifests as teaching, exploration, historical investigation, archeology, experimentation, and things of the like. [[The University]] is not known for tampering with great dark forces like some other institutions. However it is not entirely without its own wrong doings.\n\n[[The University]] is arguably the largest singular institution in all [[The Three Corners]]. Both in its members, and geographic distribution. This means its resources, and authority are equally distributed. This is not to say it is spread thin, however it is difficult to manage such a large entity. Occasionally, things that are macabre, extortionate, dangerous, or just plainly unwise are conducted under the banner of [[The University]].\n\n## Origin\nIn the [[First Age]], during [[The Taming of the Badlands]], a group of powerful academics in [[Ryze]] began conceptualizing an organization that would seek to make sense of [[The Trinity]]. It would be similar to the academic institutions of the east, but different in the fact that it would not neglect the more spiritual aspects of [[The Wills]].\n\nDuring the unification efforts of [[The Badlands]], these academics were instrumental in bringing order to the land. Originally the school began in [[The Brass Hall]], a large section of [[Brass Taldora]]. Each of the three wings within the hall was dedicated to one of [[The Wills]]. Forming The [[Arcanum]], [[Observum]], and [[Viridium]]. It wasn't long before [[The University]] outgrew the hall, and began acquiring, and constructing buildings elsewhere. At first this was just within [[Ryze]], but it soon expanded to other cities as [[The University]] began absorbing smaller organizations like [[Jhenbridge]], [[The Obsidian Temple]] and [[The First Bastion]].\n\n## Structure\n[[The University]] follows a simple method of organization, as it is complexly comprised of many different subgroups all across [[Laenwalde]].\n- ### Leadership\n\t- At the top of the hierarchy sits one master for each of [[The Wills]]. They must be in the uppermost circles of the organization, and are almost always the leader of one of [[The University]]'s schools. It is worth noting that those in this position have historically served on [[The Golden Council]] of [[Heliodor]].\n\t\t- [[Arcanum]] - Grandmaster Whiles Gennador, an aged human man, and head of [[The Brass Hall]]. Brother to High Priest Tarsin Gennador\n\t\t- [[Observum]] - High Priest Tarsin Gennador, the head of the Zolaen Church within [[Laenwalde]]. An aged human man. Brother to Grandmaster Whiles Gennador\n\t\t- [[Viridium]] - High Se'kir Fjor Mizella, a tabaxi woman of great wisdom. Head of [[The Conservatory]].\n\t- Within each of the schools, the organizational structure differs.\n- ### Size\n\t- [[The University]] is massive. It is over eight thousand members strong across all its subsidiaries.\n- ### Rules\n\t- There are many rules all throughout [[The University]], however they all circle back to one ideal: Knowledge should not be used to do harm.\n- ### Admission\n\t- Admission to [[The University]] varies based on the school which one enters.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- The [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for mind\n\n## Assets\n- [[Arcanum]]\n\t- [[The Brass Hall]], which acts as the center of [[The University]]\n\t- [[Jhenbridge]]\n- [[Observum]]\n\t- [[The Obsidian Temple]]\n\t- [[The First Bastion]]\n- [[Viridescence]]\n\t- [[The Conservatory]]\n- [[The University]] also has many satellite locations as well, like small studies, outposts, temples, and things of the like. There isn't a city within [[Laenwalde]] that does not posses a building owned by [[The University]].\n\n## Relationships\n- A strong relationship with [[Kerketh Academy]], and [[The Golden Council]]\n- An amicable relationship with the political powers of [[Gethsemane]], save for [[Ep Drukar]] which it does not have much connection with at all.\n- [[The Bladehammer Guild]] in which it has a faction of its own\n- A great dislike for [[The Kybis Assembly]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.975234423Z","tags":null},"/The-Unknown-Realm":{"title":"The Unknown Realm","content":"*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nA plane brought to [[Zol]] by the [[The Wandering Gods]].

[[The Vast Sea]] is the furthest west named region of [[Zol]]. Thought by many to be endless, this sea gives life to those who reside on the coasts of the west, and some who spend their whole lives upon it on the strange [[Keepships]].\n\nThere are tales of treasures, kingdoms, and monsters that lie beyond the eyes limits in the west. Some chase these treasures to never return, while others respect the peril of an endless sea. \n\n## History and Inhabitants\nMany of [[Laenwalde]]'s people make use of its coasts for fishing and other naval purists and even that of the woodland [[Elves]] will reap its bounty with regularity.\n\nThen of course there is the [[Keepships]]. A collection of huge, and seemingly impossible sea vessels that carry small cities on their backs. These ships are kept magically afloat, pilot themselves, and may even posses a soul. Each of these ships has a unique culture and appearance. Some are welcoming and love to trade, while others are hostile towards outsiders, and even other [[Keepships]]. Those who live on these vessels are, unique to say the least. Rarely exposed to the cultures and events of the outside worlds, the Keepshippers are  known to be hearty, unusual, and probably a bit dirty compared to the standards of The Three Corner's cities.\n\nDespite their isolation, and great lengths of time spent at sea, those of the [[Keepships]] do not go without. The ships sail them selves on courses to do trade, fish, harvest, and avoid bad weather. Pirates that have attempted to attack Keepships were met with nigh-impenetrable defenses.\n\nKeepshippers are the most familiar with [[The Vast Sea]], and tell the grandest stories of it. One story in particular is popular all over [[Zol]]. That of Lorelhiem, a supposed distant land in the far far west shrouded in magical fog that makes it dangerous to approach.\n\n## Borders\nThe sea has coasts on:\n- [[Laenwalde]]\n- [[The Kulpis Desert]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]\n- [[Holyfield]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.977234433Z","tags":null},"/The-Vertex":{"title":"The Vertex","content":"See [[The Oldshards]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.979234443Z","tags":null},"/The-Void":{"title":"The Void","content":"*What remains of the [[Sea of Monsters]], one of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nThe horror of [[Zol]].

Within it lies threats and abominations unknown even to the [[Gods]].\n\n![[The Void.png]]\n\nWhen viewing [[Zol]] from [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]] is not visible. It is thought to be hidden away by the will of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\nDespite the [[Gods]] attempts to disjoin The Void from the lives of mortals, The Void is closely related to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It looms in [[Zol]]'s history, and threatens its modern days. Only kept back by the constant efforts of the [[Gods]].\n\nThere are many physical entrances between [[The Void]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. They exist at the lowest depths of [[Zol]]. Entrances in the deepest fathoms of the ocean lead directly to [[The Void]], and entrances in [[The Underdark]] lead into The Void's subplane, [[Damnation]].\n\n## Known Properties of The Void\nLittle is known about [[The Void]]. Many scholars and theologians gather what they can about the strange space in an attempt to protect mortals from it. However some seek its power in a dark pursuit.\n\nThe known properties of The Void are:\n- Entrance to [[The Void]] is similar to most forms of planar travel, but escaping it is extremely difficult. This is due to the will of [[Gods]].\n\t- Expeditions have been made there, but few have returned. It is thought a mortals easiest method of returning is through [[Apolyatum]], the highest level of [[Damnation]].\n- The [[Void Gods]] largely view this place as the true form of [[Zol]] and seek to demolish all other planes and return them to this state.\n\t- No hard evidence exists of any hierarchy between [[Void Gods]]\n- There are likely more [[Void Gods]] than what are known to mortals.\n- [[The Void]] has distinct depths.\n\t- [[Damnation]] is thought to be the most shallow part of [[The Void]]\n\t- The deeper one ventures into [[The Void]] the more dangerous and inescapable it becomes.\n- Death in the void is unique. Academics are not sure if it exists on [[The Mortal Coil]], but interrogated [[Demons]] revealed that if one dies in [[The Void]], their soul becomes homed to it and both their vessel and soul are sent deep within its confines.\n\t- Effectively if one dies in [[The Void]], they are locked within permanently. Even to the greatest of mortal magic.\n\n## Damnation\n[[Damnation]] is a subplane of [[The Void]] and seems to feed off the souls of the [[Prime Material Plane]]'s dead.\n\n## Demons and Fiends\nResiding the the greater Void are many horrible beings called [[Demons]]. They come in great varieties and almost all have destructive intentions.\n\nWithin the subplane of [[Damnation]] resides a similar but distinctly different cast of beings called [[Fiends]]. To an uneducated eye they would seem the same as [[Demons]]. However there is a sole difference that divides them.\n\n[[Fiends]] are beings bound by oath to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they are caught by a greater demon betraying him their souls are sent for destruction. Most [[Fiends]] are endlessly loyal to Aldem because of this.\n\n[[Demons]] however are not bound to serve a master if they do not choose to. This gives [[Demons]] a sense of pride over fiends that has forged a unique hatred between the 2 groups over many ages.\n\nThe two groups of monsters clash regularly. Mortals have even been known to gain favors from one group when sparring with the other.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.979234443Z","tags":null},"/The-Wandering-Gods":{"title":"The Wandering Gods","content":"A group of powerful cosmic beings, alien to [[Zol]].

Some believe they do not even exist.\n\nBy their own definition, [[The Wandering Gods]] do not seek dominion like most powerful beings. They claim to instead be teachers to both [[Gods]] and mortals alike. While this is the reason most of their followers seek their guidance, others believe it is a thinly veiled guise which their true conquest hides behind.\n\nUnlike other [[Gods]], [[The Wandering Gods]] are defined by a moral rather than a domain.

They claim to wander the cosmos, protecting the worlds they find from the threats once faced in their home world.\n\nSkeptics believe that this is a narrative told by [[The Wandering Gods]] to gather support in their true mission to dethrone the [[Zolaen Gods]] and take [[Zol]] for their own.\n\n## The Realm of the Wandering Gods\nThe Wandering Gods all share a single realm known as [[The Unknown Realm]]. Each of them possesses their own domain within the realm that bears its own unique qualities.\n\n## Symbolism\nAll wandering gods are identified by the same symbol, that of a question mark.\n\n## Followers\nThose who follow The Wandering Gods go by the name of Sworn Wanderers.

The Wandering Gods are not fit well into this metric as academics are not aware of the extent of their power.\n\nThe Wandering Gods operate with an influence similar to that of Minor deities, but openly defy Major deities. Since they do not enact their will like other gods, it is difficult to judge their power. They do not seem to follow the rules most powerful beings do.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.986234479Z","tags":null},"/The-Ward":{"title":"The Ward","content":"![[The Ward.jpg]]\n\nCut off from the rest of the world, [[The Ward]] is a wild, untamed land where the only constants are the howling winds and the roiling seas. Its cities are built upon rocky cliffs, their halls and longhouses formed of stone and unique, indigenous wood resistant to breaking under high winds. The cities cling precariously to the edges of [[Zol]] itself. The people who live there are hardy, fierce, and no stranger to fighting against the elements or facing down the terrors of the sea.\n\nThe storms, known as [[Greatwinds]] that rage across the kingdom are a fearsome force, capable of destroying entire villages in a single night. But the people of [[The Ward]]'s cities are all to used to this hardship, and they have learned to weather the storms well. They build their homes to be strong and sturdy, with thick walls and roofs designed to withstand the strongest gales. All windows and doors face away from the North-East, opposite [[The Storm Horizon]].\n\nDespite the challenges they face, the people of the kingdom are proud and noble. They are skilled warriors, fierce and brave in battle, and they have a strong sense of community.\n\nIn addition to the storms, the people of [[The Ward]] must also contend with the dangers of the sea. The waters around their realm are home to all manner of monsters and beasts, including dragons, sea serpents, and giant krakens. But [[The Ward]]'s Vikings are fearless sailors, and they take to the seas with confidence, using their long ships to brave the waves and explore the unknown.\n\nOverall, [[The Ward]] is a rough and rugged place, shaped by the forces of nature and the will of the gods. But despite the challenges they face, the people who live there are strong and resilient, bound together by their love of their land, honor, and their fierce determination to survive.\n\n## Cities\n[[The Ward]] contains the cities of:\n- [[Often]] - Home to Some of the Greatest Warriors of [[Zol]]\n- [[Fike]] - The Driftwood City\n- [[Hoss]] - The City of Melted Stone and Enslaved [[Dragons]].\n\nThere is also the icy city of myth and rumor, [[Yoel Sundarum]]. However many believe it does not even exist.\n\n## Wilderness and Climate\n[[The Ward]] is famously rocked by devastating storms on a weekly basis. These storms, thought to be sent by [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] are said to be of a divine purpose. Regardless of their intention, the winds would destroy any other part of [[The Three Corners]] in a single day. However [[The Ward]] is no normal kingdom. Millennia of destructive winds have shaped the kingdom, its people, and its wilderness into something nigh unbreakable. \n\nThe Storms themselves come on a semi regular basis. The slight irregularity of their arrival is not well understood, but their coming is heralded by individuals of a profession known as [[Stormcallers]]. This task was made easier when it was discovered that Luna, one of [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] displayed regular patterns on its shifting surface when the storm is 3 days out. This allowed [[Stormcallers]] to better approximate the approach and greatly reduced the casualties of the profession.\n\nThe Storm is spotted as a large wave and massive cumulonimbus illuminated by lightning. At a distance, it appears as an unmoving wall of cloud. However its massive size is deceptive, as the storm moves at remarkable speed. This manifestation of weather is know as The Surge. The first challenge The Surge poses is the wave of sea water it pushes. The Ward has overcome this challenge by constructing several breakwaters along the coast that take the brunt of the impact. These must be rebuilt after every storm. When The Surge makes landfall it is accompanied by a loud sound similar to that of something breaking the sound barrier. The initial impact is strong enough to throw boulders the size of of large dogs.\n\nTo survive this, the people of [[The Ward]] reside in very strong structures specially made to deflect the wind. It is culturally recognized that when The Surge approaches, everyone ties down everything not bound to a foundation, and bunkers down inside. You could be fist fighting your worst enemy in the street, but when the winds come you table any conflict you have and get inside. Oddly, The Surge is not stopped by magical barriers. Many fool-hearty [[Caster]]s have died thinking they could best the elements using common spells.\n\nPlants have adapted unique methods of dealing with the high winds. Low grasses and bushes will fully recede into the ground when agitated. The needles of conifer trees will retract into their branches like cat claws while their trunks depend on their natural strength and and extremely deep taproots for stability.\n\nMany animals have developed migratory behaviors, burrows, or armored exteriors to weather the storms. The beasts of [[The Ward]] are also a good indicator of coming storms within the span of a day or so.\n\nAfter The Surge passes, The Cascade begins. An approximately 2 hour long heavy downpour of rain still has winds high enough to throw a person to the ground.\n\nAfter The Cascade comes the [[Stormdew]]. A unique phenomena where the heavy rain fades to a light drizzle over the course of about 2 minutes and a substance called [[Stormdew]] falls with it. [[Stormdew]] is a blueish-white, malleable substance that feels almost like clay. It is thought to be organic in nature but no one knows exactly what it is. Surprisingly it can be eaten or used as medicine, and is used everywhere in [[The Ward]]'s culture. It has a maple-like taste to it in the first half of its shelf life, that turns to a more acidic citrus flavor in its later stages of fermentation. It has a shelf life of just over a week, which works well as the falling of fresh [[Stormdew]] tends to overlap with the final days of the last forage.\n\n[[Stormdew]] is left all over [[The Ward]] in small deposits that look like little soft coins. It is foraged quickly and packed into jars once the rain begins to dry. It is used in baking, brewing and medicine. Sadly its short shelf life makes it very rare outside [[The Ward]].\n\nThe odd natural world that exists only within [[The Ward]] is a largely continental climate, but parts do see warm weather on a good day. Its shy plants, and armored beasts cover its beautiful landscape in abundance vanishing like specters at the sign of a storm leaving a barren wasteland of destruction. Then, without fail, the glory of its winding rivers and streams, now full to their brims with fresh fallen water, attract the animals to their edges. The flora soon blossoms from its safe hiding places and the strange cycle begins again.\n\n## History\nAfter [[The Awakening]], the people of [[The Ward]] found themselves in the most dangerous of regions that would later become the kingdoms. When the unprepared people were rocked by the storm for the first time, their population was more than halved. The survivors found refuge in caves near the base of [[Stormwall]]. For many years they would struggle in flooding caves, slowly discovering methods of surviving out in the storm.\n\nEventually, structural and agricultural methods had become advanced enough to support life on the surface. Many migrated to the seaside to harvest the bountiful aquatic life, while some stayed behind living more primitive lives.\n\nSix cities were constructed: Weldar, Vauz, Margith, [[Fike]], [[Often]], and [[Hoss]]. These cities prospered within the kingdoms unique way of life for many centauries. This was until the final years of [[The Dragon War]] drove many dragons to the North-East near [[The Ward]]. This gave the region a disproportionately high number of dragons.\n\nThe final years of [[The Dragon War]] were exceedingly difficult on [[The Ward]]. The Cities of Weldar, Vauz, and Margith were destroyed. The other cities likely would have been obliterated as well, if not for the kingdoms sole advantage: the storm. The [[Dragons]] were not able to predict the coming storm as well as the citizens of [[The Ward]] were. When this was discovered, the dragons were baited out to die in the destructive winds. When the dragons caught on, brave warriors would hide in the dragons' lairs to ambush, or even capture them when they tried to take shelter from the storms. These tactics would eventually go on to win [[The Dragon War]] in favor of [[The Ward]].\n\nThe people of [[The Ward]] have spent the majority of their history in isolation from the other kingdoms, only interacting with [[The Glassius Reach]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] on occasion for things like the exchange of goods and services. They have never gone to war with another kingdom, but this does not make them a stranger to warfare.\n\nThe cities of [[The Ward]] were originally all under their own rulership, each by an appointed throne called an [[Archon]]. These rulers all followed the leadership of Weldar's ruler, the Grand [[Archon]]. This balance was not respected for long as many of the cities were too proud to respect the rule of another.\n\nSkirmishes between cities began, both on land and at sea. They typically amounted to nothing more than an intense rivalry, but occasionally a city would have to surrender resources, or may even be captured for a short while. These bouts of conflict happened on and off until [[The Dragon War]]. To unite against their larger foe, the cities created a pact called [[The North Honor]] which disallowed fighting between the cities.\n\nAfter [[The Dragon War]] there was peace for over a millennia. The kingdom never rebuilt its lost cities due to its slow way of life and lost resources, but its citizens were happy. Then in the year 3842, the city of [[Hoss]] attacked the city of [[Fike]] in an attempt to claim it, breaking [[The North Honor]]. This rekindled the conflicts between cities. Now [[Hoss]] exists in isolation, attempting to overthrow its allied neighbors [[Fike]] and [[Often]].\n\nThe [[Archon]] of [[Hoss]] at the time, a Goliath man called Kereth Fjall, began to call himself the Grand [[Archon]], the first time the title had been used in many generations. Apparently, his turning on his allies was sparked by a series of prophetic dreams that his lineage would rebuild [[The Ward]] into the most powerful kingdom in all of [[Zol]]. Even in modern days his descendants uphold his dream, and push the conflict further.\n\n[[Often]] and [[Fike]] are bound by [[The North Honor]], they fight justly and honorably to attempt to uphold the peace that used to be. [[Hoss]] however uses any means necessary to win a conflict, as they idealize true strength as tenacity and fortitude over honor. They even continue the old, dark method of enslaving lesser [[Dragons]] to aid them in combat.\n\n## Inhabitants\nPopulated by mostly [[Humans]] and [[Goliaths]], and a minority of various other races. The region is relatively accepting of outsiders as they don't often get visitors. However 3 groups often face discrimination: [[Dragonborn]], [[Kobolds]] and [[Warforged]]. [[Dragonborn]] and [[Kobolds]] are discriminated against due to their draconic blood. They are still allowed amongst society but many treat them quite poorly. [[Warforged]] are seen as sacrilegious due to their [[Iron Light]] physiology. They are usually killed or locked away in a dungeon.\n\n## Government, Economy, and Laws\nThe cities of the kingdom govern themselves and there is no singular ruler. [[Often]] and [[Fike]] are allied under [[The North Honor]] against their common foe of [[Fike]]. Within these cities, a ruler called an [[Archon]] sits upon the throne. Within [[Hoss]] leadership is passed down to heirs, but in the other cities it is voted upon.\n\nThe Kingdom is by no means wealthy compared to the others, but that has little effect on how they operate as [[The Ward]] is quite isolated. The common class structure of: Lords/Ladies, Common Folk, and Peasantry can be seen in its cities.\n\nEach city governs its own laws.\n\n## Arts, Culture, and Religion\n[[Religion]] is the grand motivator of [[The Ward]]. [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s influence is ever present within the kingdom's culture. The main ideals of the kingdom are that of strength, unity, and proving ones self to the kingdoms sole god, [[Adrathar]].\n\nArt and culture revolves heavily on the idea of communal gathering. Traditional dances, great feasts, competitions of strength, storytelling, and music are highly treasured. People will gather in great hall's built to [[Adrathar]] for these events.\n\nMany warriors, usually the young, will take on a pilgrimage to venture out into The Storm Isles, called [[The Enduring]]. The purpose of this journey is to prove themselves to [[Adrathar]]. One who takes this challenge is supposed to venture as far north east as they can, braving sea and storm. They are to push and push until their body gives out. Where the body stops, there is said to be a gift from [[Adrathar]]. This gift may be something simple like a stone or piece of driftwood that will bring their family great prosperity, but some have even found lost magical weapons. Then there are the rare few who are made [[Stormblessed]]. These individuals are said to be approached by [[Adrathar]] himself within a storm and given a gift of power. These gifts manifest as magical abilities of varying power. Some have received great strength or speed, sometimes even wonderous things like flight or the power to control lightning.\n\n[[Stormblessed]] are extremely rare and there is usually only one or two per generation. When one is gifted these powers they are accompanied by ever present marks on the body that look like war paint.\n\nThose who follow in [[Adrathar]] say he sends the storms to *prepare his people for what is to come*. This ominous verse is repeated all throughout [[The Ward]]'s culture. Non-believers think this is an engrained doctrine used by [[Adrathar]] to manipulate his people.\n\n[[The Ward]] also disallows the usage of [[Iron Light]]. There are many layers to this dogma, but the followers of [[Adrathar]] see it as a bastardization of sacred symbols. Usage of [[Apparatum]] is a crime within [[The Ward]]. The runes of the [[Ferric Alphabet]] can instead be seen inscribed decoratively all over weaponry, clothing, art, vessels, and architecture. [[The Ward]]'s culture sees these manifestations of magic as holy, and not for the meddling of mortal hands.\n\n## Academics and Magic\nMuch education and apprenticeship within [[The Ward]] is conducted via private tutelage. Mentors will either accept payment for their services, or will seek out pupils and offer them teaching. It is a great honor to be offered such a gift and is almost never turned down. [[The Ward]] is not academically gifted compared to much of the other kingdoms, but there are a small handful of academics who are incredibly well accredited.\n\nThere is one academic institution within [[The Ward]], [[The College of Hoss]]. It is dwarfed compared to [[The University]], [[The Kybis Assembly]], and [[Kerketh Academy]]. However it does offer some very unique teachings. The college is a dark any mysterious place located on the very edge of [[The Three Corners]]. It rarely takes on students, and is known to be almost a sister-school to [[The Kybis Assembly]].\n\n## Political Climate\nOn good terms with its nearby kingdoms, [[The Ward]] is currently pressured only by its internal struggle between. [[Hoss]] and its rival allied cities of [[Often]] and [[Fike]].\n\n## Military\nThe kingdom has a considerably small amount of fighting troops compared to the rest of the world, but it probably has the most capable fighters. Fortunately for  [[The Ward]] its isolation and storms makes them undesirable for conquest. It has by far the best navy, but shares only a small connection of sea with [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. However some brave merchants will carry ships across the lands to [[The Narrow Sea]] to make trades with [[The Glassius Reach]].\n\nCurrently, the cities are undergoing a civil war.

I am salvation, I am peace, I am The Watcher In the Door\"*\n\n[[The Watcher in The Door]], also known as [[The Watcher]], is the being who spun [[Zol]] from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by speaking [[The First Tongue]]. He created the pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]]. [[Zolaen Scripture]] says [[The Watcher]] was also the first being ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], the being who's corpse became [[Zol]].\n\nThe Watcher is seen as [[Zol]]'s founder, protector, and visionary by his followers. He guides [[Zol]] through chaos and suffering to a true and perfect paradise. Those who follow him and his will be reborn in the perfect world, and those who stray into sin will forgotten to time.\n\n## Depiction\nThe Watcher is depicted in 2 ways. The first and more simple is as an ordinary man. This may be of any age or creed. His skin is covered in scars from his battle with [[The Wretch]]. These scars, called Stigmata, have a holy significance in many religions. His spear, Voidbane, is always present in some form.\n\nHis second form is one of legend. Described as an endless sea of celestial light and power. Scripture tells of mortals who were blinded when they gazed upon this form in the flesh. Clergy who claimed to have seen this form in dreams or visions describe an experience of passion, awe, and fear beyond that of anything else.\n\n## Symbolism\nThe Watcher's symbol is an empty arched door, matching that of the planar [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for divinity.\n\n## Behavior\nThe Watcher is known for being kind and protective to his followers, but direct and wrathful to those who would oppose him. The Watcher seeks to uphold his laws for the greater good of [[Zol]].\n\n## Realm\nThe Watcher resides in [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]], a celestial landscape above the clouds. It bears a valiant golden palace for the [[The Watcher]], some of his fellow gods, his greatest followers, and his chosen dead.\n\n## Worshipers\nThe followers of The Watcher are conservative in nature. Following the rules set in scripture, these individuals worship and pray to their god of light in cathedrals all over [[Zol]].\n\n## Relationship to The First Tongue\nThe Watcher created [[The First Tongue]] when he spun the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]]. In relation to this, [[Zolaen Scripture]] says:\n- The watcher knows all words from [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[The First Tongue]] is an extension of his power, and [[Wordbearers]] are mere aspects of him","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.991234504Z","tags":null},"/The-Wills":{"title":"The Wills","content":"[[The Wills]] are the three known possible manifestations of [[Magic]] sourced from [[The Trinity]].\n- [[Observance]], [[Magic]] connected to gods or some other source of power itself other than nature\n- [[Viridescence]], [[Magic]] connected to the power of [[Zol]]'s natural world\n- [[Arcana]], [[Magic]] pulled from the unbound power that exists all throughout [[Zol]].\n\n All power in [[Zol]] must manifest in one of these ways.

Home to beastfolk, bandit, witch and wizard that seek a lifestyle unoffered by the societies of kingdoms. [[The Witchlands]] were were relatively unpopulated by sapient beings at the time of [[The Awakening]]. This allowed for beasts and monsters to claim the region long before the kingdoms could even consider the feat.\n\nThere was a period of time in the mid [[First Age]] where [[Kapesh]] attempted this feat, but failed many many times. Eventually it was recognized that taming [[The Witchlands]] was too great a challenge, and no one has since tried to make a kingdom of it.\n\nDue to its dangerous environment, only the strong and powerful are able to make a sort of home in the region. Either that or an individual needs to be under the protection of a very powerful being. This has made a great home for those who seek to live outside the laws and cultures of normal society.\n\nThe region is taken by naturalists, wildly beastfolk, bandits, outsiders, wizards, and most notably [[Witches]]. Great and powerful wielders of magic have claimed the region in their own sort of way. As the witches of [[The Coven]] and [[The Cult of the Mothers]] spin spells in the remote corners of [[Zol]], common folk from all of spin tales of the strange things that go on within [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Points of Interest\n- **Godwood Deep** - The deepest extent of the largest forest in all of [[Zol]], The Godwood, which spans [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], [[Kapesh]], and [[The Witchlands]]. Famously dangerous, the Godwood is sometimes referred to as 'the inside edge of the map' as it is largely unexplored and new things are constantly discovered within it. \n  \n  There are many accounts of individuals entering Godwood Deep, and experiencing strange geographical phenomena. It is said that when one loses their way within Godwood Deep, they may become *Lost*. This unique brand of losing ones bearing is by no means ordinary. Navigational equipment, and sense of direction fails you entirely. Emerging from the tree line exposes a changed, and unknown horizon of landmarks. This strange land is know by some as **Beyond The Brush**. It is filled with fantastical wonders, and dangerous mysterious. Some claim it even contains small, strange civilizations. Getting one's self Beyond The Brush is supposedly quite difficult to do with intention, and escaping it is equally difficult. This makes gathering scholarly information about the region quite difficult. Some believe it is the border between the [[Fey]], [[Fell]] and [[Prime Material Plane]]. Some just flat out deny its existence.\n  \n  What follows are the landmarks within Godwood Deep that are not located Beyond The Brush.\n\t- **The Alk** - A grand and ancient tree. It is the eldest of its magical, endangered species. The tree emits a protective ward over its local region. Other Alktrees exist throughout the region, however they are extremely rare. Their roots descend remarkably deep into [[The Underdark]]. Their wood is said to bring good luck, and almost seems to glow in moonlight. The heartwood of the tree is much stronger than most metals, and is revered in the art of [[Imbuement Perpetuum]]. Some believe the Alktrees are tied to [[The Great Wall of Roots]], but this is mostly based upon folklore. This tree acts as the meeting place for [[The Coven]].\n\t- **[[The Alktree Haven]]** - A remote convent of like-minded individuals who seek refuge within [[The Witchlands]]. Built under the protection of a juvenile Alktree.\n\t- **The Greatrocks** - A collection of massive boulders located in the very center of [[The Witchlands]].\n\t- **Old Barlen** - A collection of old ruined buildings mysteriously located within Godwood Deep. Not quite a town itself, but almost like a chunk of an old forgotten city. No one knows its origin, but it was discovered during The [[Beast Ire]] Plague. A nest of monsters to be avoided at all costs.\n\t- **Pine Valley** - A beautiful valley populated by many [[Beastfolk]]\n\t\t- It is also the home to [[Dreadslayers]], a faction of skilled and mysterious monster hunters\n\t- **Z'veril Swamp** - A dangerous swamp that seems to try and swallow anything that enters it.\n\t- **Herzal Camp** - A large permanent camp of dangerous bandits known for causing trouble within [[Kapesh]].\n\t- **Robal Camp** - A large permanent camp of anarchistic bandits. Not known to be outwardly aggressive, but are highly territorial.\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\t- **Mortal Valley** - A cursed place known to be inhabited by Death [[Witches]].\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n\t- **Zorberg** - A tiny, out of place village tucked into the foothills of [[Demodemacht]]. This quaint town is kept safe by the Hearth Witch Luna Elzamore. It is home to the broken outcasts of society she has taken into her care.\n\t- **The Caverns of Ghar Nalon** - A complex cave system that goes deep beneath [[Zol]].\n\t- **Temple of the Moons** - A mysterious temple located within the peaks of [[Demodemacht]]. Inhabited by the eclectic Sex [[Witches]]. Strangely, even if you know the way to this temple, you can only arrive at dawn. Otherwise it is hidden to any who seek it.\n\t- **Axidawn Valley** - The furthest north reaches of [[The Witchlands]]. Tucked into the mountains this valley is home to [[The Cult of the Mothers]]. It is said to be an absurd, and treacherous place.\n- **Everfall** - a large magical forest that is always stuck in a state of autumn. In some places the fallen leaves are piled so deep you can suffocate within them if you are not careful.\n- **Ghalt Kratur** - A unique crater that was present even before [[The Awakening]]. Made by a massive celestial object from [[The Cosmos]] that broke through [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Not only did the impact leave a fantastic geographical feature, but left a large hole within [[The Great Wall of Roots]] that allows for academics to perform interstellar observations of [[The Cosmos]] with a much higher degree of clarity than anywhere else in [[The Three Corners]]. Many [[Arcanists]] who reside in [[The Witchlands]] make this region their home.\n\t- **The Painted Stones** - A small canyon located within the foothills of [[Demodemacht]] where the stones are colored vibrantly. It is not know why this is, but some theorize it is an effect of the impact that left the crater. It is now home to many  Art [[Witches]].\n- **The Purelakes** - A collection of lakes, known to be home to strange creatures. Many believe the waters within the lakes posses magical properties.\n\t- **Lake Urir** - Technically within the borders of [[Kapesh]].\n\t- **The Long Lake** - A slender, seahorse shaped lake that exists at the edge of the swamps.\n\t- **The Corkum Pool** - Actually a salt water pool. It is surrounded by hot springs and geysers. The pool itself is not a true hot spring, but is warmer than its neighbors.\n\t- **Wizard's Well** - below this lake exists many water filled caves.\n\t- **The Axe** - The supposed home of the mythical 'Adowel, the Great Lake Serpent'.\n\n## Climate\nThe area is considered temperate-continental, but Everfall is an exception as the area seems to be locked in a constant state of comfortable autumn weather with bouts of heavy rain.\n\n## History and Inhabitants\n[[The Witchlands]] have always been recognized as a place beyond the means of mere mortals, however there have been the tenacious few who have tried to make claim to it. Only the greatest have been able to do so. The largest organization to try, and fail in claiming it was the kingdom of [[Kapesh]]. They made many attempts at expanding their borders into the Godwood. Many outposts were built, most of which eventually fell to the beasts of the wood. However one has stood against all odds, [[Little Triumph]] remains to this day and has now grown into a small city.\n\nOnly smaller, less organized groups have been able to make a home within [[The Witchlands]]. These groups are:\n- The [[Beastfolk]] who rejected violent ways during the [[Beast Ire]] plague.\n- [[Arcanists]] who seek solitude. These individuals remain distant from civilization either for personal privacy, or to pursue research that society may deem problematic, dangerous, or dark. These individuals may organize in small groups or remain solitary. Regardless, to defend one's self they must be of above average skill.\n- Free thinkers of [[The Alktree Haven]]. A large convent built only a short distance from [[Kapesh]]'s border. A union of powerful mages, druids, clergy, and warriors who seek community or refuge outside the region\n- Bandits who reject society\n- The [[Witches]]. A complex and powerful people who have the most widely known reputation of these wilds. [[Witches]] are powerful users of magic that span many practices. Each witch is unique in their use of the craft, but all share a rejection of the industrialization of the world. [[Witches]] uphold the natural beauty and disorder of things, treasuring nature, art, and the spiritual world. [[Witches]] do not subscribe to one singular doctrine, but tend to organize themselves in covens, sisterhoods, convents, and things of the like. Those who practice similar domains of witchcraft typically gravitate towards each other. \n\t- When the concentration of [[Witches]] first grew to such a magnitude that covens used to cross paths into each other, an overarching community was quickly formed. A group called [[The Coven]] was formed. 13 groups of witches each agreed on a single member from their smaller practices to represent them. They formed a coven so grand it would unite all witches within the region, a magical powerhouse that could rival kingdoms and would ensure none could bastardize the beauty and freedom of the region.\n\t- However during the late [[First Age]] an internal struggle began amongst [[The Coven]]. 4 of the 13 members had begun to gravitate towards the teachings of a darker magic. That of the [[Hags]]. The remaining 9 rejected their urgings to seek the eldritch knowledge The [[Hags]] were thought to posses. So the group was divided. [[The Coven]] became 9 and the 4 became [[The Cult of the Mothers]].\n  Despite their divided state, The influence of [[Witches]] is undeniably great within the region. The impact made by these groups was the cause for its namesake, [[The Witchlands]].\n\n## Academics and Magic\nInformal education is conducted on a surprisingly great scale for a region without cities. [[Witches]] will teach each other skill and spells, secluded wizards may take the occasional student within their tower, and some students from the various academic institutions are urged to venture out into the region on a pilgrimage to obtain worldly knowledge.\n\nWhile their search for knowledge is a common trait, their crafts are not. Amicable groups will commonly spend time with one another to learn what they can. However these groups do not always play nice. Some wizards tend to view the witches as troublesome, uneducated, fickle, or merely and obstacle in their way to greater knowledge. Witches on the other hand view many wizards as problematic, destructive, and tampering with things they do not yet understand. There are frequent bouts of fighting between these groups.\n\n[[The Coven]] and [[The Cult of the Mothers]] has even resorted to fighting in recent years. Their differences have grown too much and [[The Coven]] fears what [[The Cult of the Mothers]] may bring into the world.\n\n## Borders\nThe region borders upon:\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n- [[The Korus Arctic]]\n\nIt also contains parts of the mountain ranges:\n- [[Stormwall]]\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:01.995234524Z","tags":null},"/The-Word-of-Blades":{"title":"The Word of Blades","content":"*Faraday, The Edge of [[The Edinokai]], Bearer of The Word of Blades, Wielder of [[The First Tongue]]*\n![[Faraday.png]]\n\nThe greatest swordsman of [[The Three Corners]].

His snapping occurred during a massive fire caused by a red dragon attack at the Cathedral of [[The Trinity]] in [[Stigmata]]. At the time, Valmore was a well known warrior of the [[Galliard Crown]]. He rushed into the building to save those trapped inside. Accounts of the event say that the fire which burned that day was hot enough to melt stone. The building collapsed, and caved into its foundation. The rubble smoldered for three days before anything could be recovered from it.

From these three things, we are one.*\n![[Trinian.png]]\n\n## Overview\n[[Trinaism]] is a Trinity-Centric denomination of religion within [[The Three Corners of Civilization]]. It is based in the firmly held belief that all things, even the [[Gods]], are only allowed to exist through [[The Trinity]]. It defines [[The Trinity]] as a deity, a thing which is seen by other religions as a force rather than a god.\n\n[[Trinaism]] teaches the idea that all things are one. All things come from [[The Trinity]], and ultimately all things return to [[The Trinity]]. Even alien things from [[The Cosmos]] must adhere to the [[Magic]] and divine aspects of [[The Trinity]]. The latter fact is supported by science.\n\n[[Trinaism]] also teaches the idea that there is a careful, intended balance to all things which [[The Trinity]] has orchestrated. However, the [[Zolaen Gods]] granted the people of [[Zol]] free will. Through this gift, it is possible to create imbalance in the world, and only through the teachings of [[The Trinity]] can people maintain its careful balance.\n\n[[Trinaism]] sees the [[Zolaen Gods]] as extensions of [[The Trinity]].\n## Values\n- Structure\n- Connectedness\n- Unity\n- Order\n- Rebirth\n- Balance\n- Excellence\n- [[The Wills]]\n- [[Magic]]\n- Fate/Destiny\n- Free Will\n- Prophecy\n- Divinity of the [[Zolaen Gods]]\n- [[The First Tongue]]\n- [[The Old Tongue]]\n- [[Vizir]]\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[The Trinity]]\n- The [[Zolaen Gods]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\nIn regards to the [[Origin]] of [[Zol]], [[Trinaism]] believes that [[The Trinity]] preceded the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Trinian scripture says that [[The Trinity]] was core to the power once held by [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]. In defeating [[The Wretch]], [[The Trinity]] chose [[The Watcher]] as its avatar, and granted him access to [[The First Tongue]] allowing for the creation of [[Zol]].\n\n### Ancient Society\nTrinian scripture believes that the civilizations of [[Old Zol]] had an intimate understanding of [[The Trinity]]. This understanding was what lead ancient society to become advanced and holy. However, in its later years the people of [[Zol]] strayed from the balance of [[The Trinity]].\n\n### The Undoing\nTrinian scripture talks about the ancient people of [[Old Zol]] straying from [[The Trinity]]'s careful balance. It is said that they did this in an attempt to reach divinity themselves. In doing this, they created such an imbalance in the world that [[The Undoing]] occurred. It is thought that this imbalance was created by ancient [[Humans]].\n\nIt is believed in [[Trinaism]] that [[The Trinity]] began weaving threads of Fate to ensure the people of [[Zol]] would never stray into the dark again.\n\n## Church Structure\nThe Trinian Church is known for its adherence to hierarchical structure. These hierarchies form based on communities an their connectedness to greater societal groups. This is most often seen within the scope cities. Cities will usually have a grand cathedral dedicated to Trinian Worship. This cathedral would be lead by an **Obseratum**, the highest form of priesthood within [[Trinaism]]. Beneath that would be **Grand Priests**, **Arch Priests**, **High Priests**, and finally **Priests**.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist [[Trinaism]] typically focuses on the concept of order, and interconnectedness between things. It idealizes the concept of being exemplary within ones life. It does not teach the ideals of going on to greater things. To put another way, if you are a farmer it is holy to be a *great* farmer. This is because great farmers are needed to maintain the interconnected aspects of society, people, and the world itself.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for its idealization of hierarchy, order, balance, and structure. This manifests largely as the ideal that everything is as it should be. It believes that [[The Trinity]] has placed everything in its place, and one should respect that place. Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] is known for supporting one-sided societal structures like high nobility and [[Slavery]].\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n[[Trinaism]] is extremely wide-spread. It exists within most regions of [[The Three Corners]].\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Trinaism]]'s specific teachings about structure, order, and interconnectedness largely depend on the interpretation of the clergy within one's church. Trinian scripture as a whole is comprised of many texts. This has made for many unique interpretations of the religion's details as not all priesthoods value each piece of writing equally. \n- [[Trinaism]] is closely related to the [[Ashian]] church. They have many similarities. However the nuances of [[Ashian]] religion are what make them distinct.\n- Fundamentalist [[Trinaism]] supports the ideas of [[Great Magic]] and [[The Triumvirate]].\n- [[Trinaism]] is similar in many ways to Zolaen-Centric belief. However, it holds [[The Trinity]] above the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n- Some manifestations of [[Trinaism]] contend with the idea of [[The Anti-Trinity]], a dark counterpart to their god.\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- The Trinual, located nearly all over [[The Three Corners]].

Separated by [[The Narrow Sea]], these nations warred from roughly annum 2600 to 4000. Initially sparked by [[Gethsemane]] enslaving humans who crossed into their territories, and [[Kapesh]] doing the same with [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. [[Kapesh]] offered an exchange of prisoners, which [[Gethsemane]] rejected.\n\nThis rejection sparked conflict between the nations that lasted centauries. It wavered in intensity over the years, and its core motivation changed from enslavement, to expansion, to resources, and finally religious differences. \n\nFew major effects surfaced from the battles aside from death, and political divide. However, the city of [[Riverbridge]], originally part of [[Gethsemane]], constantly changed hands due to its location on the border. Slaves were eventually traded between sides for their freedom, any many died in the extended conflict. However, the conflict did give a foothold for the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Peak of the Battles\nThe peak occurred during annum 3673. [[Gethsemane]] had sought the aid of a powerful being from [[The Void]] called [[The Maul Bearer]]. A demon of great strength who was to be given any territory he conquered as payment, so long as [[Gethsemane]] kept him unbound from [[The Void]]. The demon and his army destroyed the [[Kapesh]] city of [[Rello Arr]] and its surrounding territory, creating the West Scars.\n\n[[Kapesh]] was able to kill the [[The Maul Bearer]] and his armies before they took [[Kierketholl]], but the attacks left [[Kapesh]] weak for generations. This weakness later gave way to the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Information on Slaves during the Battles\nEnslavement of [[Humans]], [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] sparked the initial conflict, and later became a bargaining chip between sides. These slaves began to be treated more as high valued prisoners than slaves, as their value in trades during conflict often outweighed their value as workers.\n\nThey suffered much injustice during these times, but the [[Off-Human]] slaves faced a much darker fate. The ways the nations had to stretch during wartimes depended heavily on the labor of slaves. The greater the stakes of the battle, the greater the mistreatment of [[Off-Human]] slaves. Many recognize this suffering as the greatest of all during the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\n## The Triumvirate Concord\nAfter the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] and the creation of [[Warforged]], the [[Triumvirate Battles]] entered a state of fast moving destruction and exhaustion of resources. The machines were so efficient at warfare that they expedited the rate at which the conflict occurred far beyond what normal military strategy could prepare for. This created a sort of mutually-assured-destruction. This, paired with the fact that some [[Warforged]] would go rouge and attack their masters on occasion, made for very bloody battles.\n\nThis forced [[The Triumvirate]] to reconsider their disputes. The world had changed so much and it was evident how little [[Zol]] knew about itself. The kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] struck and agreement to stop the conflict, and release all slaves that were [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].\n\nPolitical amicability grew over time, but cultural divide never faded. Still to this day there is great disdain between the people of [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]].\n\nSince the concord, no major conflicts between kingdoms has arisen.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.029234697Z","tags":null},"/True-Form":{"title":"True Form","content":"see [[The Glassius Reach]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.029234697Z","tags":null},"/Uroga-Hag-of-the-Sea":{"title":"Uroga, Hag of the Sea","content":"*Void God of Fathoms, Major Deity*\n![[uroga.png]]\n\nQueen of the deep, the most powerful of the mysterious [[Hags]]. she who commands the horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean.

Common folk work the farms and business bumbles away normally. This all fades away to strange parties, distant hysterical laughter, and growls of monsters (if you believe the rumors). Some say that it is urban legend, while others tell stories of curses from [[The Witchlands]] or that the veil between the [[Fell]] and [[Fey]] is thinner in [[Viscera]].\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | A city full of strange citizens and occult mysteries. The nightlife of the city is vibrant, and there always seems to be something mysterious and fascinating going on. |\n| Main Challenge | The nobility of [[Viscera]] have a lot of sway in what goes on within the city, and seem to get away with anything. They are very active during night life. Rumors exist about them living longer than they should and engaging in cult practice. Regardless of the legends about them, they treat the common folk like their playthings. |\n| Climate | Temperate/Continental |\n| Cuisine | Imported foods, wild game, fish, hearty foods, spirits, beer |\n| Export | Fish, spirits |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| Many |\n| City Leader | Lord Hugo Sidgewick |\n| Primary Language(s) | Human |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | Human |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Trinity-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Lakeside, Nightlife, Creepy Atmosphere |\n| Architecture | Gothic |\n| Color(s) | Black and Gold |\n| Symbolism | An interlocked Sun and Moon |\n| Defenses | City Garrison, Purelake Navy |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The high class members of society. Most of which are very eccentric and strange. They are typically very active in the city's nightlife and have a great deal of mythos around them. Some say they are secret cult members following some ancient and evil thing, while others go as far to say that they are secretly monsters who feed on the population. Either way the city lords of Viscera are known for letting them get away with anything they want since before even the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. |\n| Common Folk | Social Class | The working class of the city, most of which live just above the poverty line. These individuals typically do not go out during the active nights due to superstition. |\n| Beggars | Social Class | Those unable to find work.

Some think the city is truly owned by Lord Vodeen, a high noble and head of his own house.

Its balls and parties are very extravagant. A small portion of nobles who visit the city decide they want to live there permanently. An even smaller portion disappear entirely.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Viscera]] was one of the cities hit the hardest by the [[Beast Ire]] plague.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Many people go missing within the city, mainly travellers, slaves and beggars.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.036234733Z","tags":null},"/Vizir":{"title":"Vizir","content":"Vizir is a fragment of [[The Trinity]] held within all beings in [[Zol]]. When harnessed, it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way, granting [[Magic]] power. It is largely thought to be the very essence of ones soul, and can be trained like a muscle.\n\nUtilizing one's Vizir is no simple task and can be very exhausting. It is typically accomplished in one of three ways for each of [[The Wills]] respectively.\n- **Faith**, for [[Observance]]. It requires that one believes in the power of their source, and that they themselves are a worthy candidate for it. Any shred of doubt weakens the channeled power significantly. The closer the bond between [[Caster]] and source, the stronger the [[Magic]]. This belief opens them up so the power of their source can pass through them, and be transformed by their will.\n- **Understanding**, for [[Viridescence]]. It requires one to mentally blur the line between self and nature, and allow for their will to bleed into the surroundings. This allows one to work with nature, or bend it to their will.\n- **Conceptualization**, for [[Arcana]]. The most abstract of the craft. Requiring a user to have a full image of the reality they are trying to create in their mind. It can be done in an infinite amount of ways, but is typically thought of in terms of [[Arcanists]]. \n\t- Take the example of an arcanist using a [[Spell]]. It requires one to visualize [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. These visualizations differ greatly from practice to practice, and even [[Caster]] to caster. These bonds can be relatively simple or immensely complex. For instance, the [[Spell]] Mage Hand (when taught academically) is performed by an arcanist who is visualizing a space near them to be directly connected to their hand, or the part of the mind that controls their hands. Even though the bond is non-existent, they must fully convince themselves of it mentally. On top of that they must utilize another part of their mind to draw [[Energy]] from [[The Trinity]] to make the hand move and manipulate objects. This is called [[Splitting]]. Splitting is extremely difficult and gets very complex very quickly. Skilled [[Arcanists]] can split their mind dozens of times for complex spells, convincing themselves of non-existent realities that sometimes even contradict one another.\n\n## Other Methods\nAlternatively to that, other individuals have been known to use entirely unique methods to access any of the three wills. Like use of artistry to conceptualize the effect of a [[Spell]]. Some warriors will use their own blood to infuse their weapons with their [[Vizir]]. Others may not even view what they are doing as magic. Warrior monks will use great focus, breathing, and movement techniques to empower their physical body with Vizir, or [[Ki]] as they call it. Some are known to even surge with [[Magic]] in the heat of battle, charged by rage or determination.\n\nThis has lead to intense debate amongst scholars and theologians. Many believe they have the true understanding to the shape of [[Magic]] and [[The Trinity]], but others argue only a sliver of information is known about the true nature of [[Magic]] and [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAnother practice of [[Vizir]] is the utilization of [[Iron Light]]. [[Iron Light]], which involves inscribing runes on plates of iron, which allow a user to lend their [[Vizir]] to produce wonderous effects. The difference between [[Iron Light]] and all other aspects of [[Vizir]], is utilization of an object created with [[Iron Light]] requires no magical knowledge to produce a magical effect.\n\n## Connection to The Old Tongue\nGreat practice with one's [[Vizir]] is thought to lead to discovery of [[The Old Tongue]]. This leads to theories by some scholars that [[The Old Tongue]] binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] temporarily. Which largely increases magical power, and makes accessing it less exhausting.\n\n## Vizir 'Burning'\nA rare phenomenon observed most commonly amongst mages in battle. This phenomenon is described as a hyper focused state where one accesses their internal power with little to no difficulty compared to their normal experience with the practice. It was thought originally to be related to [[The Old Tongue]], but most scholars agree the two are unrelated.\n\nWhen one 'burns' their [[Vizir]] they go into a sort of trance, and experience the sensation of extreme heat within their chest. Metal within the vicinity is pushed back upon like a repelled magnet. The effect is most prominent with silver and iron. Individuals near a 'burner' can actually feel the repelling sensation, this is likely because of the trace amounts of metal within most people bodies. Beyond that, those within the vicinity of a 'burner' feel cold radiating from them. The repelling force emitted from this individual varies in strength. Some accounts record it as strong enough to push a metal cup across a table, other accounts claim 'burners' have thrown full grown men in plate many feet.\n\nWhile most commonly observed amongst mages, there have been record of warriors, unpracticed in magic, emitting the same repelling force in battle.\n\n## Vizir and Lifespan\nIt is not known why, but a stronger [[Vizir]] tends to extend ones lifespan naturally. This seems to vary on a case by case basis. Some powerful individuals have been known to live almost 3 to 5 times as long as expected.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.036234733Z","tags":null},"/Void-Gods":{"title":"Void Gods","content":"*Fear the depths of Zol, for not even the Gods know what true horrors lurk in its Void*\n\nThe Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]].

It is a relatively uncommon, and unstructured belief system. It is based in the idea that [[Gods]] are not infallible, divine entitles. Rather that they are beings who hold a great deal of power, and are actually more likely to make mistakes because of it. [[Wanderian]] scripture teaches the idea that individuals must learn to live in a world where [[Gods]] are imperfect, and that one should hope that [[Gods]] reflect this same perspective.\n\nThese ideals are taught in the scriptures of [[The Wandering Gods]]. A group of strange [[Gods]] believed to be of some alien origin. [[Wanderian]] belief says that [[The Wandering Gods]] are beings who seek to teach, rather than rule.

This is assumption is often made based on the religion's other teaching regarding the dangerous nature of the power held by [[Gods]].\n\n## Church Structure\n[[Wanderian]] worship does not have much structure. It is most often practiced on an individual level. However, there are a few churches that do exist. These places do not have the grand hierarchy that larger belief systems like [[Trinaism]] and [[Dorian]] belief do.\n\nChurches formed in honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] may be organized to honor all of [[The Wandering Gods]], or just one of them. These churches are usually led by a singular **Priest**, though sometimes there are multiple priests.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief largely focuses on the idea of learning a single moral of one of [[The Wandering Gods]].

In a place where the scale of physical and magical power is vastly different on either end, warfare can become far too dangerous if not kept in check. There is a set of unwritten rules used by kingdoms and cities in warfare, lest the battles become too destructive.\n\nIt is typically fought by armies of soldiers of comprised of individuals or relatively low power, without much magic to their disposal. Dispatchments of normal individuals, who have been trained to wield simple weapons, and fight on behalf of their kingdom. When the battles become more significant in their impact, opposite sides of the conflict may start to bring out more dangerous weapons and fighters. However, this task must be carefully managed, as retaliation can cause for exponential growth in the destructive forces used on either side.\n\nThis practice comes from lessons learned in the early days after [[The Awakening]]. Many cities rose and fell, as the battles were extremely destructive. It is also one of the reasons new kingdoms and cities don't often appear. They would not have the resources to sustain a battle that exceeded their level of strength.\n\nThere are a few well known examples of this destruction getting out of hand:\n- The introduction of [[Warforged]] into the [[Triumvirate Battles]]\n- [[Gethsemane]]'s alliance with The Maul Bearer during the [[Triumvirate Battles]]\n- [[The Word of Wrath]]'s sudden appearance at the end of the [[Western War]]\nMutually assured destruction maintains a balance amongst warring kingdoms. It serves no one if the battle ends with both sides buried underneath rubble.

Some say [[Warforged]] were discovered, while others say they were created. Their bodies are comprised of engineered materials, and extremely complex [[Iron Light]] configurations. [[Warforged]] were originally used as soldiers during [[Triumvirate Battles]]. Their effectiveness in battle changed the shape of the conflict so quickly, that it brought the centuries long conflict between [[Gethsemane]] and [[Kapesh]] to an end. However their usefulness to the mortal world did not end there.\n\n[[Warforged]] became a mechanical slave race of people for the kingdoms of [[Zol]]. Made specifically to serve, their treatment became a thing of great debate. Some think that since they are machines, they do not need to be treated as people. While others believe that they are to be liberated, as they bear a soul. Unfortunately for the latter group, their voice is the minority. This is largely due to the fact that [[Low Automata]] existed prior to [[Warforged]]. This makes it so the complex, and sapient [[Warforged]] are often compared to the mundane [[Low Automata]]. In the late [[Second Age]], [[Warforged]] servants have become so commonplace that even [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], which is famous for its anti-slavery laws, allow [[Warforged]] servants.\n\n[[Warforged]] who are created for the purpose of serving, do so willingly. The beings themselves do not seem opposed to their original purpose. However those who are not created for a purpose have been observed pursuing greater meaning. Some even 'liberate' other [[Warforged]]. This is done by subduing servile [[Warforged]] and making modifications to their [[Iron Light]] runes within. These 'liberated' [[Warforged]] also go on to pursue greater meaning.\n\nOccasionally, [[Warforged]] will go 'rouge'. This is caused by issues with or damage to their [[Iron Light]] configurations. Nine times out of ten, this results in violent outbursts, and thoughts of insanity for these [[Warforged]]. A rogue [[Warforged]] is an extremely dangerous thing.\n\n[[Warforged]] can be all shapes and sizes, perhaps in the most literal sense. In fact, the first [[Warforged]] was a highly complex writing utensil created during the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] at [[The University]]. They are constructed to best fulfil their purpose, but most have the ability to swap out non-integral parts such as arms and legs.\n\n| Trait | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lifespan | Unknown |\n| Height | N/A |\n| Significant Locations | None |\n\n## Additional Info\n- The name ''[[Warforged]]\" was first given by the humans who constructed them at [[The Kybis Assembly]].

The clop of horse hooves, the sound of wheels clicking against cobbles, and the heavy drumming of rain on the cab's roof reminded her how tired she was. She'd failed. An exhausted sigh left her lips as Kalimae removed her mask. She didn't know what the consequences would be, but she expected they'd be grave.\n\n\"The one who turned out the lights? I'm surprised. I never took you for a theatric.\" The individual sitting across from her chuckled with small amusement. Kalimae turned towards him. His form, lit by moonlight shone through the ornate window, was as still as a statue. Ominous. In the darkness of their carriage his pristine, white robes seemed to almost luminesce of their own accord. The distant flashes of lightning caused his metallic mask to glint. Sword-like. An unmistakable danger. Unlike the Ball's guests with whom she had been forced to spend her evening, this man was known by his mask.\n\n\"I'm not. Theatrics have their purpose too.\" Kalimae stroked her cat as it crawled up into her lap.\n\n\"You don't have to play coy with me, Lady Sky. Our business is grim. I believe we should find the little joys wherever we can.\" Her companion's face covering was as expressionless as ever. His eyes bore into her. Deep, inquisitive voids. But she could hear the lilt of a smile in his voice. She always could. As if he lacked the ability to worry.\n\n\"You don't seem perturbed by my failing. Lord Renaull lives.\"\n\n\"Yes. Unexpected, as most in attendance wanted him dead. But as you will soon learn, not everything can be controlled. We adapt. Even the almighty gods failed to protect their own. When one door closes...\" His voice was cheery, slightly sing-song.\n\n\"So what now? Pressure the other nobles to kill him tomorrow?\"\n\n\"No. Curtis will live to give his speech.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" Her brow furrowed, unsure at the sudden pivot.\n\n\"Plans have changed. He wants the bomb to go off.\"\n\n\"What!? You can't be serious!\" Kalime sat up sharply. \"Is that not what we've been sent here to prevent?\"\n\n\"Sadly, it is not. We have been sent here to act on his behalf. Not protect. That has been, and will always be our purpose. The shape of the task matters not.\"\n\n\"Wh- why?\" The well-dressed woman sank slightly back into her seat. Regaining her composure somewhat.\n\n\"Because you've made a discovery. Something that will serve us better than assassination.\" He adjusted his own position now, mirroring her. Slowly. As if the motion was painful. Kalimae held her silence, wanting him to make the next move. Her companion seemed to understand this.\n\n\"Them.\" His wrapped hand made a vague gesture back towards Septurn Manor. Kalimae paused, confused.\n\n\"The‚Ä¶ party crashers?\" She squinted, unsure as to why anyone at that party, besides Lord Renaull and Master Coinge, would be worth their attention now that the bomb was to go off. \"I thought they had already served their purpose?\"\n\n\"That's what we were told. But they have proved themselves effective during their short involvement with our schemes. I believe he wants to use that. Or perhaps this was his plan all along, I'm not sure. He only tells me what I need to know.\" The ever-casual nature of her superior seemed less friendly now. More cold. Kalimae began to sweat.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He wants to make a spectacle. A show of power.\"\n\n\"I‚Ä¶ I don't understand.\"\n\n\"When the bomb goes off there will be chaos. We will resolve this chaos.\"\n\n\"So we will let hundreds die, just to give them a later salvation? And what do those fools have to do with it?\" Kalimae scoffed, appalled.\n\n\"You will need to grow a thicker skin than that if you wish to inherit, Lady Sky. Sacrifices must be made. It's a war we are fighting. And do not fret about the details, you merely need to act as our blade in the dark.\"\n\nThe world went suddenly quieter as the carriage passed into a smooth brick tunnel where the street cut through the first floor of a large building. Rain and Cobblestones no longer filling the silence between words. She could hear it again. That sound. The wretched chorus of her companion's flesh shifting and sloughing beneath his full body covering. Constant and horrifying. Gideon frightened her, yes, but she had gotten used to his disturbing nature. She had even grown to appreciate his company. However, she had not gotten accustomed to this‚Ä¶ thing they followed. The person Gideon, and the others, seem to view as nearly omnipotent.\n\n\"What is he?\" She asked, voice just above a whisper.\n\n\"A man.\" Gideon spoke simply.\n\n\"Why does everyone say that? As if you've all rehearsed it or something. I've seen what he can do, what they can all do. They aren't people like you and me. They're-\" Kalimae was interrupted by Gideon's gently raised hand, stopping the young woman before she said something she would regret.\n\n\"It's what he asks to be called.

Despite his age, he did not have a name. But most stones lacked this trait, so it never struck him as odd. Our stone had traveled the world in his years. Wondrous places like the far deep underground, the regular-amount-of-deep underground, the not-so-deep underground. He even made it to the mysterious surface. Propelled by frost and geology, he was proud of his journey. However, none of his adventures lived up to being chosen.\n\nCreatures were strange things, people most of all. All soft and bustling about. Plants at least had the decency to stay in the same place, but people could go anywhere. Strange as they were, something was intriguing about how people made things. The hands that chose our first of three stones were not experts at making, but they were passionate. These hands mortared many stones, bound together, greater than the sum of their parts. Each mortared in place with all the care the hands could muster, but care alone can only get one so far.\n\nOur first stone was mortared with diligence, but it was placed without experience. This misplacement meant our stone bore the burden of his peers for many years, far heavier than any stone should. Though to his credit, he held strong long after the hands were dead and buried. Long after the children of those hands had sold their inheritance. Long after the buyers and the buyer‚Äôs buyers had gone, leaving the stones abandoned. He had grown so tired. There was beauty in being a part of something more, but nothing lasts forever. He was the first stone to fall.\n\nThe other stones came soon after, falling in huge pieces and chunks. Smashing through ceilings and floors. It was fortunate our second stone fell when she did. For if she had fallen too early, or too late, this all would have been for nothing. She was an elegant stone, perhaps lucky. For she fell alone, perfectly dodging between her clumsy, tumbling peers. She struck the glass of a candle holder, one which had been left on a table long ago. A candle holder, so perfectly placed that the mid-summer sun would catch perfectly in its lens-like form. softening, and melting its wax in the afternoon light. Our second stone shattered the glass and the liquid wax joined the free-fall.\n\nOur final, and heaviest of three stones was the last to fall. Capstone was his name, or possibly his title. He wasn‚Äôt exactly sure. Capstone had done well in his duty, gazing up at the sky and stars. Catching rain, and withstanding storms. Now his job was falling. A job Capstone did quite well. He was the kind of stone that onlookers could watch with delight as it was thrown off a bridge, splashing down into the waters below. His destructive weight carried him through the fall faster, and more powerful than the first and second stones.\n\nCapstone gained speed as he fell through the open hole created by his peers. His acceleration was only stopped momentarily when he struck the top of a bookshelf. The bookshelf, not built to withstand falling stones, was no match for Capstone‚Äôs inertia. Capstone broke through the top of it and slammed corner-first into the texts lining its shelves. Tomes exploded into paper and bindings. They filled the air like antique confetti. Academic literature, novels, cookbooks, and many others left alone by those who had otherwise scavenged the abandoned building. The remains of books joined Capstone in his fall, mixing with falling debris and wax.\n\nThe mundane pages of religious scriptures, cartographic representations, and long-forgotten ledgers swirled in the torrent of objects, mixing with something. Something magnificent. A detail, imperceptible to anyone who may have seen the long overdue collapse of the structure. Pages of a Journal. A journal holding something old, something secret. A secret sharp and telling, like a piece of history, broken off and forgotten. Something unknown, amazing, and dangerous. Something now buried beneath stones, upon stones, upon stones.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.040234753Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Adjunct":{"title":"Weaving - Adjunct","content":"Merle loved working at the Adjunct. Most scribes found it busy, tedious, and involving far too many face-to-face interactions with the public. Not Merle. The constant scratching of ferroillumic pens, the smell of paper, and the rich colors of ink were a second home to him. How could anyone hate this? Just that morning he had helped a young Eucaren woman make contact with her long-lost family. Sure, most who came and went were the grouchy, self-important, lower-upper class. Folks who were successful enough to conduct their business via span read, but too poor or technically incompetent to keep their own.\n\n\"Send this to House Balpin of Meritas, boy!\" A pinch-faced halfling woman shoved a rolled message in his face as soon as he returned to his desk. Merle just smiled, taking her message and her coin. He had never heard of House Balpin, nor what jurisdiction Meritas was in. This was going to be a good one!\n\nMerle skipped down the narrow corridor into a wide-arched chamber dotted with bustling scribes. A chorus of quills on paper made the room sound like wind through long grass. Hundreds of span reads covered nearly every surface of the room. Most were still as stones, but the rest were scratching away, receiving some message from across The Three Corners.\n\nMerle ran over to the grand shelf and selected a massive tome. He thumped it onto a table and fingered through its thin pages with expert precision. The hunt. The thing he lived for. 10 years ago it would have taken him the better part of an hour to find Meritas. Today he found it in four minutes flat. The texts held within the Adjuncts across The Three Corners were the combined work of thousands of scribes. A history of efforts to catalog every relevant family, organization, and location all across the known world. Merely parsing the information in these texts was a craft of its own.\n\nMerle wrote down the signet code associated with the adjunct nearest to Meritas and retrieved the corresponding hunk of metal from a box on the opposite end of the room. He plunked the signet down into an unoccupied span read and took a seat. Now was time for his reward, the gossip held within the tiny scroll. Some heir seemed to have made another illegitimate son. What fun! The pinch-faced woman had been rude, but only slightly so. As merle copied down her note, his slight rewording of her message conveyed the desired message in a very efficient, and succinct manner. It also happened to make the customer seem *ever-so-slightly* illiterate to her recipient.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Ahamatath":{"title":"Weaving - Ahamatath","content":"*Stolen from the restricted Bladehammer Guild Archives by Cyrus on the 19th of Spring, Annum 4466.*  \n\n*Official Communication from the desk of Guild Master Helg Corsair - five years and two seasons ago.*\n\nHail, Trusted Guildminds.\n\nOnly the most crucial members of our organization have been sent this message. By now, you've read the guild's official statement on the God Killing, or Ahamatath as the clergy have dubbed it. This is our unofficial communication on the topic. Burn after reading.\n\nRegardless of personal belief, the following information will be crucial for the years to come. All major, and most minor religious organizations across the three corners have attested to divine confirmation of Giriam's death. Irregular agriculture and varied population trends across the kingdoms and wild cities have already wrought havoc. Also, I have it on good authority that dragon sightings have more than doubled in all mountain ranges within our influence. Most are undocumented dragons. We expect this to become common knowledge in the coming months.\n\nReligious, political, and economic turmoil have been projected by our best scholars. Disaster comes. Our allies reflect these findings in their own, independent work. Even if corrective infrastructure can be put in place, the shifts in power structure will spell chaos, terrorism, and war. This is our best-case scenario.\n\nWorse, the implications of dragons reemerging and the absence of a god could have apocalyptic implications. We, as The Bladehammer Guild, are used to operating as one of Zol's most established organizations. My speakers tell me that if The Ahamatath holds true, our organization could be rendered insignificant. We do not have the tools to comprehend the true magnitude of what could be occurring. Let alone the capacity to stop it. My advisor, Speaker Murphy Gallain, said the best comparison would be if the wind itself died.\n\nWe do not know firsthand that Giriam is dead, and we may never have concrete evidence of the event. The world still needs salvation, even if we cannot provide it. If we cannot protect the world, then we will protect The Free Cities. Something moves against us. All of us. Be it deception, divinity, or something worse.

Their campaign in Alderun was supposed to be over now, and this detour had left him in a sour mood. More than usual, at least.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be in Kapesh?\" A taunting, feminine voice came from the corner of his room. Haith turned nonchalantly to see Kalimae. The slender woman had snuck in and reclined in one of the chamber's cushy chairs.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be in mourning?\" Haith gave flatly, meandering over to the chair across from her and slumping down into it. He didn't look like it, but he was glad to see her. Private, equal company was a rare thing.\n\nKalimae leaned forward, snatching up a bit of sliced yellow fruit from a tray between them. \"If the plan had actually involved me marrying that arrogant little momma's boy I would have killed myself a week ago.\"\n\nThat won a genuine, albeit small smirk from Haith. \"May he find peace in Aeordel's embrace.\" He gave sarcastically, grabbing a few slices for himself.\n\n\"So why are you here?\" Kalimae stood, stretching.\n\nHaith shrugged \"Dunno. I think he had another one of his visions.\" Haith said the last with implication. Kalimae raised an eyebrow at his insubordinate tone.\n\n\"Wow,\" She chuckled, \"look at the pair on you. Having doubts are we?\"\n\n\"What?\" Haith snapped defensively, \"No I‚Äî\"\n\n\"It's fine, Haith. I know the feeling.\" Kalimae said the last grimly, then made a dismissive gesture. Her dark hair glowing hazel in morning light that poured through an easterly window. Overlooking The Grand Nothing. Awkward silence took the space before Haith eventually changed the subject.\n\n\"Those no-kills from Tenzentak are here. Saw them walk through the front gate with Gideon this morning.\" Haith gestured at a different window that faced Pale Ward's entrance. A landmark much further than any normal person could see from their tower. \"Any idea why?\"\n\n\"Other than to get in my way? No idea.\" Kalimae reached over to pet her cat as it emerged from behind a curtain. He'd have to get a new room now. Inheritor or not he was still allergic to cats.\n\n\"They're definitely weapons.\" Haith did a poor job masking his annoyance at the sight of her familiar.\n\n\"Aren't we all?\" Kalimae teased as she lifted her cat who gave an enthusiastic purr. Brandishing him as if he were a threat to the demigod. \"What's your take on them?\"\n\nHaith sat back, as if giving it real thought for the first time. \"Well they're all vizians, but that's to be expected. The Goliath and The Mutant's ultimate purpose is obvious. Power housed like that is dangerous.

He'd grown proficient at pretending he wasn't terrified. Pretending he wasn't a traitor.\n\n\"What in The Watcher's name is this place?\" Laizen mused. Craning his neck towards the high, vaulted ceiling. Their torches barely lit the width of the corridor, let alone the depth of the expansive tunnel.\n\n\"We're not rightly sure Mr. Laizen, sir.\" Cliff Guntry's response echoed meekly off the featureless walks as he nervously adjusted his miner's lamp. The grizzled, yet socially awkward, Head Miner of Rozwald Rift Iron Extraction wasn't accustomed to working with guild members. Though he seemed glad for their company. \"We find things every once and a while, but nothing so‚Ä¶ well preserved. And this is just the entrance. Wait till you see the pit.\"\n\n\"How long ya think this' been beneath Tenzentak?\" The ring of light from Eddoch's torch drifted towards the back of their group as other members sauntered past him. His thick dwarven hand sending up a puff of dust as he brushed it across the floor. Thin, near-imperceptible grooves cut the stone beneath his fingers.\n\nTardich knew. He shouldn't know, but he did. He kept the fact to himself. His friend's would be somewhat curious as to why the lackadaisical westerner knew ancient secrets about their city. There had to be at least one booky mage in their dispatchment with an inkling of where they were.\n\nAs if on cue, Speaker Murphy piped in from the front of the crowd. \"Nothing sacred‚Äî doesn't have the look.\" The arcane light that shone from his hand was largely blocked by his ridiculous, absurdly wide-brimmed hat. Creating an eclipse-like corona of light around his silhouette. Fuckin' mages. As a speaker, Big Hat Murphy was probably the most dangerous person in Tenzentak. But did he have to flaunt it? And in such as stupid way?\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Laizen jogged to catch up with the mage.\n\n\"Well, you've been in ruins before Laizen. What do you usually expect to find in a place hidden and buried like this one?\" Murphy's question was simple, but his tone wasn't the least bit condescending. Very‚Ä¶ teacherly Tardich thought.\n\n\"Hm,\" Laizen pondered. \"Stuff. Carvings at the very least, but usually statues or sarcophaguses. Sarcophagi?\"\n\n\"Sarcophageeses.\" Eddoch added absently.\n\n\"Exactly. And the curve of this ceiling‚Äî it's very precise. I'm not much of an artificer, but I would wager these are engineered for strength, not aesthetics.\"  \n\"You'd be right, Mr. Speaker, sir.\" This time it was Cliff who scurried to the front of the pack. \"The permanent tunnels we cut are to very similar specifications, but never this wide and definitely not this long. Rift Iron grows and moves like slime mold. It's what causes all the collapses. Shafts need to be strong as possible under The Rifts.\"\n\nMurphy gave Cliff a nod of appreciation, then stooped. \"And you feel these grooves in the rock? A common artifact of earth shaped by magic.\" Both Edoch and Cliff opened their mouths to interject, but were stopped by Murphy's raised hand. \"‚Äîyes, it is possible to make it smooth if you are skilled. Like many dwarves are. But it is a lot faster and a heck of a lot easier to just scrape what you wish to move.\"\n\nA lull began to form in the conversation, Tardich wanted them to piece an understanding together before they were too deep. He'd have to push the topic. \"So‚Ä¶ they made it strong and they made it quickly. Sounds‚Ä¶ industrial.\" Murphy had been on the right path, but required a little urging. Being wrong around smart people tends to make them smarter.\n\n\"Yes, or‚Ä¶\" Murphy tapped at his chin in thought. \"Military‚Ä¶ Hm, I think I know what this might be.\"\n\n\"And?\" Laizen, Eddoch asked in sync.\n\n\"I'm‚Ä¶ not sure. If I'm right it could be dangerous.\" Big Hat Murphy looked to the Head Miner. \"Mr. Guntry, thank you for all your help today. I think you'd best let the guild take things from here.\"\n\nCliff paled a bit, \"Right! I'll uhh‚Äî\"\n\n\"Persephone, perhaps you could walk Cliff back to The Rifts?\" Murphy suggested, turning to face Persephone who looked uncharacteristically ill in the flickering torchlight. The pallid guild mind didn't even attempt a response. Opting instead to nod her clammy face and wave for Cliff to follow. No one assumed she'd rejoin them. That was why Tardich never ate at the mess hall. Bad case of the shits can bring anyone down.\n\nIt wasn't long before the dozen or so remaining members reached the end of the tunnel. The prominent arch giving way to a circular chamber. It's enormity paling even the corridor's daunting proportions.¬†\n\nEddoch's whistle echoed deep into the pit before them. \"Wow. That's a fuckin' lot of stairs.\"\n\n\"Thank The Trinity for apparatum.\" Tardich sighed as he shrugged off the shoulder bag he'd been tasked with carrying. Eddoch, and a few others doing the same. In a few short minutes the group had huge metal spikes driven into the walls. Anchor points for long ropes that now dangled into the immense, stair ringed pit.\n\n\"Are you gonna keep us in suspense or what?\" Tardich groaned.\n\n\"Well,\" Murphy began as he affixed his harness and activated his winch. \"The mages of The First Age weren't like those you know today. Academia is more‚Ä¶ well founded. Safer. Think of Arcana like a forest. You can try to cross it in any way you like‚Äî\"\n\n\"‚ÄîBut you may not make it through.\" Laizen interrupted, eager to show his understanding. The tall elf was the next to activate his winch, descending after Speaker Murphy. Soon everyone was dangling in the pit. A chorus of faint, echoing, metal gears sinking deeper and deeper into The Underdark.\n\n\"While modern academia knows the safe trails through the woods, most early mages who tried to master the unknown went mad, or died. Typically both.\" Murphy sent a few motes of dancing light into the pit ahead of them. There was no bottom. \"But‚Ä¶ those who did 'make it through' were different. Better. The best of the best. Academia's uncertainty acting like a filter. They knew things‚Äî could do things we've all long forgotten.\"\n\n\"Their hats must have been fuckin' huge.\" Eddoch offered from somewhere above.\n\n\"Indeed.\" Murphy chuckled. \"They were a large reason society never folded to Zol's perils. How we found Iron Light. How we built our cities, survived The Beast Ire plauge, how we‚Äî\"\n\n\"Won The Dragon War.\" Tardich interjected.\n\nThe brim of Murphy's hat bobbed as he nodded. \"They made weapons. Defenses.

They were the words Cliff always used to signify the start of his introduction.\n\n\"Some of ya may have ‚Äòerd ‚Äòbout the mines already. I don‚Äôt care what ya think ya know, if you‚Äôve never been in a Rift Iron mine yer as green as can be. Wee babies. I‚Äôve had miners, spent decades pulling gold and silver up from the ground, lost or killed on their first day 'cause they thought they knew best.\" Cliff watched the crowd shift worriedly. Some hid it quite well. Other's didn't.\n\n\"Rift Iron is a fickle creature. As I am sure most of ya know, she‚Äôs a magic ore. Expensive too. Capable of all sorts of wonders when refined. But, as a metalliferous stone, she wants ya dead. She'll do it too. Rift Iron veins move and spread like mold on week-old bread. This makes mining it a real bitch.\" Cliff paused to take a drink of water. He had to make his speeches without his filtermask, and the rift air burned his throat. They wouldn't get masks. It was only fair he'd suffer the same at times.\n\n\"There are three things unique to Rift Iron mining. First, it grows. Like I said before, it moves beneath the earth like a fungus. This means that when we mine it, we never extract the entirety of a vein. Always leave behind a quarter of what ya find.\" The crew didn‚Äôt seem bothered by this. They were being paid a flat rate for the day, so it made no difference to them.\n\n\"The growth leads to our second point. Rift Iron wanders. It moves through rock like a rat in a wall. Though it's slow as molasses. Much of what we do down in the mines is track where a vein is heading. Prediction lets us adjust to follow. If a foreman is telling ya to dig in a strange direction, this is why. We can hear ore moving through the rock. Makes a squeakin‚Äô sound.\" As expected, some raised their eyebrows at this.\n\n\"G‚Äôhead. Listen for it. Put yer ears to the ground.\" Cliff made a low gesture. The crew became suddenly hesitant, no one wanting to be the first. Most were curious but afraid of looking silly.\n\n\"That‚Äôs an order. You‚Äôll do it hundreds of times today, so ya best get used to it.\" Cliff crossed his arms, waiting patiently. With reluctance, the crew got down on hands and knees, pressing their ears to the stone. After a moment some members recoiled, looking down at the ground speculatively.\n\n\"It's louder down below. If ya hear a squeak a few times each minute, that's normal. A few times every second, that's danger. If ya hear cracking, popping, or movement in the stones, run. In a Rift Iron mine, collapses aren‚Äôt a matter of *if*, but *when*. We tunnel in arches and extract in domes. It's the most stable. Luckily at the Rozwald Mines, we are deep enough below Tenzentak that we needn‚Äôt worry about causing sinkholes or other hazards for the upper levels of the city.\" Cliff could see some were having second thoughts. And they should be.\n\n\"Collapses are typically small, and always heralded by squeaks. They don‚Äôt usually result in casualties or trapped miners. However, it does happen. You may also discover caves, or old sections of mines that have been blocked off. Avoid those. Also, we are not the only creatures down there. If ya encounter anything that isn‚Äôt a person, run. But, if ya have to, yer pick makes a formidable weapon. There are lots and lots of tunnels, you‚Äôll hear old miners call it The Maze. Don‚Äôt lose yer way in the panic.\" Cliff didn‚Äôt miss the human man at the back abandoning the group. Not an unwise decision.\n\n\"Lastly, as I am sure yer all aware, Rift Iron makes smog when it grows. No one knows why it does that, but the greenish smoke is toxic. ‚ÄòS why the air hurts so much down here. Burns. The smoke seeps through the stone and is let out in low concentration. However, sometimes it gets trapped in an air pocket underground. If you open a hole and thick green air pours out, do not breathe. Tell a foreman and evacuate the shaft.\"\n\nThe speech was tired and overused coming out of Cliff‚Äôs mouth. Learned by decades of repetition. He was so used to saying it, that he barely thought about what the words meant anymore. However, he never got used to the look on their faces. Their poor, defeated faces. Rock bottom. Literally. He knew each of them wanted to turn tail and get as far as possible from the god-forsaken mine. But they had no choice. Desperate people doing desperate things.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Elsewhere-in-the-City":{"title":"Weaving - Elsewhere in the City","content":"\n*This weaving is a series of scenes that all occur simultaneously with the start of  [[Godkiller Chapter Summary - 17 - Fight Dirty]]*\n\nToday is the first of three tournaments. A worthwhile event, drawing the eyes and attention of all who can afford it. Food, shouting, betting and bludgeoning. A competition you wouldn't want to miss. Though not all could make it this day. While the audience of our heroes drones with cheers and boos, elsewhere in the city a deal is struck.¬†\n\nAn unremarkable trade on its own, but one of many attributed to a greater purpose. A purpose that could turn Tenzentak on its very head. Across the room, a one-tusked orc groans in pain. He grips his wounded leg, split stitches seeping blood that grows crystals, and kills the moss on cobblestones. He interrupts the tense meeting, shouting at his meek accomplice to bring him another dose.\n\nElsewhere in the city, plans are remade. Poisons mixed, favors called, dates set, and officials paid off. There would be another opportunity. Lord Renaull may have survived, but the game is far from over.\n\nElsewhere in the city, pickaxes are swung. Exhausting work. Cracking stone and chasing ore. Downtrodden risking their lives for scraps. Heavy breaths of acrid, toxic air pulled through wet handkerchiefs fill the lungs of exhausted laborers. Their painful monotony is broken only by the periodic, terrible shaking of the walls. Miners holding still as statues, wondering if this will be where it ends.\n\nElsewhere in the city, Gilligan's lift receives its routine maintenance. With the tournament in full swing, few are seeking its passage today. Cables replaced, cogs greased, and seats shined. The fixture is so known and well-used by passengers and attendants, that it has taken on a personality of its own. She seems to creek with satisfaction on this blissful sunny spring afternoon.\n\nElsewhere in the city, an old head-butler enters a disreputable tavern. His face cloaked by a deep hood. He asks the intimidating barkeep if there are any \"skilled farmers looking for work\". After a pregnant pause, he adds that there is a \"heard of pesky livestock that desperately needs tending to\". The barkeep chuckles at the phrase this man was given. It marks him as an inexperienced noble. The fortunate assassins he hires squeeze House Rozwald for every penny it's worth.\n\nElsewhere in the city, the train rolls into Tenzentak Station. The doubled guard checks every single disembarking passenger before they are admitted into the city. The same is repeated for the departing. The air is sharp with nervous tension at the authoritarian atmosphere, and buzzing excitement for the coming festival.\n\nElsewhere in the city the blacksmith and the butcher stand a safe distance from The Haunted Lumberjack. They gossip and debate about the outsiders who were seen squatting within. The comings-and-goings of this group, who have been speculated as up-to-no-good, have quickly become the talk-of-the-town within their quiet village.\n\nElsewhere in the city, four machines wear disguises. Today they will make a statement. Not the full display, but an introduction for what's to come. The chime of a wineglass before a toast, the lights dimming before a show, the tuning of an instrument before a song. An action that says \"Look at me, for something is about to happen\".","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-End-Times":{"title":"Weaving - End Times","content":"\"I saw it with me own eyes!

Pieces of it wash up on the shore of history like the remains of a shipwreck. A scene of a man darting through rain-soaked alleyways in the dead of night. Panting nervously, he peers out from his hood, anxiously searching for something amongst the moonlit city streets.\n \nHe does his best not to trample sleeping beggars, far too cold, wet, and hungry to take notice of his panicked stride. After a great deal of searching, the man clumsily slides to a stop and breathes a shaky sigh of relief. He looks at the dilapidated wooden door marked with a faded symbol. A symbol he has come to dread. After a cautious moment, the man works up the courage to enter only to find the cold iron handle locked from the inside. He contemplates calling out, but before he can open his mouth, he hears a quiet unlatching sound.\n \nThe man steps inside the now unlocked door to find an empty and dark stone room, bedded in an uncomfortably thick silence. The only light is a thin moon beam cast into the center of the space from a hole in the deteriorating roof. The man, ever nervous, seems to expect this. He steps into the center of the humble room and waits.\n \n\"You're late\" speaks a steady voice from one of the room's dark corners.\n \n\"I apologize, there were complications during today's council.\" The anxious man does his best to keep his composure, as he turns to face the voice. The man's own voice was deep, and he articulated his words carefully, giving the impression of nobility. However, he could not match the authoritative tone of the thing in the corner, nor could he keep the tremble of fear from his voice.\n \n\"With all your influence you can't even manage to conclude a meeting on time. What good are you to me if even a task as simple as that is beyond you.\"\n \n\"Again, I apologize. It is a difficult time to be a ruler.\" the regal man responded, in a carefully defensive tone. A long silence filled the space. The anxious ruler swallowed, his dry throat clicking audibly. After a time, the thing in the darkness spoke again.\n \n\"Hm.\" the voice gave a single casual laugh. \"I suppose that is true. Regardless, do not leave me waiting again. When I call, you come.\"\n \n\"Yes, my Lord.\"\n \nAnother uncomfortable pause formed within the cold room. After a time, the man decided to risk a question. \"Why did you send for me?\"\n \n\"You are to withhold rations from your people for 11 days\" The darkness instructed\n \n\"11 days?! But they will starve! It will be mayhem!\"\n \n\"Do not pretend to care for their wellbeing.\" The presence reprimanded. \"If you possessed half the stomach that one of your status should, it would be no more difficult than lifting a finger. The others will ensure you remain unharmed in the fallout. Do not dare question me again, for you know the consequences.\"\n \nThe man gave a quick, fearful nod. \"Gods help me\" he muttered quietly to himself, then winced at his choice of expression. It was an old habit which did not serve him well in present company.\n \n\"Gods?!\" laughed the voice. \"You still pray even in the wake of my destruction? I use you as a tool to dethrone the heavens and you still believe they hold your salvation? I am not sure if I am impressed or disgusted. There are no gods. All beings are mortal under the coil. Fear is your only god. Pray to it.

He had only been back for a day since his journey with Magnus and he was already fighting again. His foe, a tenacious dwarf, let out a frustrated cry. Most Goliaths were slower than Hobb, and the attacker had little experience fighting someone so large yet light on their feet. The dwarf's frustration only lasted a moment longer as a whirl of Hobb's meteor hammer caught the man in the skull. Staving in his helmet and dropping him. Hobb barely had a chance to breathe before the next assailant came out swinging. How many were there? It was hard to tell as the distant Stormwall had blocked out two of the night's moons. They needed this fight to end, and soon.\n\nConsidering it was an ambush, Hobb's squad was fighting well. Unfortunately, they were a bit slow in their initial reaction and had gotten themselves surrounded. Luckily, his squad were the better fighters. Years of drills meant they were quick to take Hobb's commands. He'd managed to get their backs to a rock face, too tall and steep to climb. A good tactic, but only until the storm hit. If it did, they'd all be smashed against it like bugs on a window. Friend and foe alike.¬†\n\n\"What the hell was going on?\" Hobb wondered. There was no logical reason for this fight, Greatwinds close as they were.¬†\n\nHobb dodged another slash on his right, but a slim, spear-wielding human man on his left struck out with a jab. He turned, avoiding a fatal blow, but allowing the spearhead to cut deeply along his side. Hobb felt the blood soak his shirt immediately. He winced, wishing he hadn't lost his shield earlier in the fray. However, the lack of it left his off-hand free, and he was able to get a hand on the attacker's weapon, hauling the spear out of the assailant's hands. Hobb didn't even bother spinning it. Instead, he brutishly shoved the weapon handle first into the attacker's eye. The man died screaming. Their enemies became less and less aggressive as Hobb and his squad brutally thinned their numbers.\n\n\"Shitty fuckin' bandits they are! Why aren't they running?! The storm's less than an hour out! They keep this up we're all dead!\" Thin Joan cried, a forehead wound forcing him to squint through bloody eyes.\n\n\"They ain't bandits,\" Hobb said firmly. Loud enough so the attackers could hear over the clatter of weapons. The incongruously dressed foes didn't respond, but the look in their eyes told Hobb he was right.\n\n\"Whaddya mean?\" Thin Joan shouted, annoyed, gesturing at their foes with his axe. It seemed a pointless and strange distinction to make given their situation. To Joan's credit, the attackers were well disguised. Dirty, sporting furs and stolen armor. But they didn't fight like bandits. Vagabonds of The Ward hated The Ramshorn, like how fire hates water. It wasn't uncommon for them to suddenly attack patrols, but not at a time like this. Not when you could hear its roar. The Storm.¬†\n\nBandits would often conduct raids a few hours before a storm hit. It was a lowly act, but was not explicitly against Zephyeran customs, attacking in the time before the Greatwinds were close enough to be audible. It was an unconvincing rationalization for criminals to make, but they did it anyway. The tactic granted the element of surprise and a better chance of not being chased off. That time had passed.\n\nHobb knew a lot about bandits. Not only had he made a career of fighting them, he had once been one. Suffice it to say, Hobb was an expert on banditry. In his thieving days, his gang would have seen a situation like this and tailed it. Possibly even surrendering if unable to escape. When the storm came, bandits sought shelter in whatever dirty hole they used during Greatwinds, knowing the Ramshorn wouldn't risk chasing them so close to the Surge. These men didn't know that. It wasn't that they didn't understand the danger the storm posed, they were hiding something. Something worth dying for. Hobb wasn't sure, but he guessed his squad had gotten too close to whatever these men were keeping secret out in these woods. No, they weren't bandits. They were scouts. Hoss scouts. War was coming.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Godian-Bestiary-Goblins":{"title":"Weaving - Godian Bestiary - Goblins","content":"*The Common Goblin, Goblina Commonus*\n![[GoblinDiagram.png]]\n\n[[Goblins]] are one of the many entries within this Bestiary that exist between the realms of monsters and men. Plenty of goblins across [[Zol]] exist as ordinary citizens of the 5 kingdoms. However, many more reside in the wilderness; living as primitive tribes that often clash with outer villages. Society, especially Kapeshian society, often views goblins as monsters. In reality, they are fully sapient, possess no planar alignments to the Fell or Fey, and can organize themselves well in society. Their place in the world comes instead from a long history of oppression.¬†\n\nIn the early [[First Age]], goblins were witnessed consuming things considered spoiled, unpotable, or otherwise unsavory. In reality, goblins have low olfaction and exceptionally strong stomachs. Meaning they seldom get sick from bacteria grown on food, or in stagnant water. This, paired with the way Goblins often simplify speech (known as goblin‚Äôs cant), gained them a false reputation for being unintelligent.\n\nGoblins are known to easily make homes and easily form communities. They prefer living in very small spaces and will reproduce quickly. However, they seem to possess an instinct, or biological advantage to not overpopulate. This means that in cities, they will form small tight-night communities, usually on the fringes. In the wild, goblins flourish quite well. Their rapid reproduction and migratory abilities allow them to form massive tribes that will break apart when overgrown. Goblins naturally form a hierarchy based on dominant traits. This unfortunately contributed greatly to their oppression during the [[First Age]]. Their mistreatment was what led many of them to take to the wilderness.\n\nIn modern times, [[Dreadslayers]] must tread carefully when contending with threats involving goblin tribes. Most civilizations see goblin tribes, or *feral goblins*, as they are commonly known, as monstrous threats. However, they are people, just like any other. They possess art, religion, and culture. While one may not initially see the significance, or impact, clashing with goblin tribes should be taken with the same significance as clashing with bandits, witches, beast folk, or cities. There are important political implications with these deceptively simple people. Most notably many goblin tribes are allies with [[The Coven]]. When contracted to deal with a goblin tribe, it is better to drive them away using smoke and intimidation rather than slaughtering them.\n\nIf one should engage with goblins in combat, they possess no specific weakness to iron or silver. Therefore, steel is recommended. Poisons are slightly less effective, so it is not recommended one waste their time with them. Often their bodies are quite delicate; raw physical force is historically the most effective method of dispatching a goblin.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Lectures-on-Ferrication-1":{"title":"Weaving - Lectures on Ferrication - 1","content":"*Next part: [[Weaving - Lectures on Ferrication - 2]]*\n\nThe common man often associates apparatum with terms such as arcane, useful, or mysterious. Practiced artificers use only a single word to describe it. Tedious. Your life as an artificer will be a long sequence of tiny, devastating mistakes. Punctuated occasionally with minor success. You‚Äôll spend your days wishing for finer tools, better eyes, and a third hand. Repetitive stress injuries, migraines, and hours of wasted work will become regular to you.\n\nYour job, in essence, is to convince objects they‚Äôre something they aren‚Äôt. A daunting task. Altering the metaphysical world. What would you say if I were to ask you, as you are now, to make a spoon think its task is to absorb angular momentum? Put your hands down, it was rhetorical. You would likely shrug your shoulders, or say something along the lines of *use magic*. But what does that even mean? Even if you knew the fundamentals of artificery, how would you sum up the idea of absorbing angular momentum? Even in Common, it is a challenge. Harder still, you have to tell a spoon to stop being‚Ä¶ well *a spoon*.\n\nThere are only two trusted methods in artificery. First, try everything until something works.

Scratch that. Take everything you know, and throw it out the window. For our first lesson, we will be discussing the concept of domain. Domain is the heart of artificery. It is the culmination of the abstract rules that allow things to exist and interface with one another. Let's go back to our example of the simple spoon. What makes it a spoon? Its material? Its shape? Its use? Our perception? All of the above? Regardless of what makes it a spoon, the fact it is a spoon cannot be denied. It possesses its own nature. Domain is the aspect of reality that allows it to do so.\n\nYes, I understand that sounds complicated, deranged, and pointless. I assure you it's not. Allow me to simplify the idea. Let's imagine a world. A simple, two-dimensional box. The edges of our world are impenetrable walls. Nothing can exist outside of them, and nothing can pass through them. Inside our world are tiny dots. Let's say Three of them. And These dots like to move. When they are born, through your imagination, they pick a random direction and travel along that path. Straight line. At a continuous speed. If they hit an obstacle, be it the edge of our world or another dot, the path randomly changes direction.\n\nIt is a simple, and dull world, but it provides a useful example. For you see, in this world, there is a short list of domains we can easily understand. Firstly, the dots. They exist with a simple set of rules and behaviors. Domain. They move, bounce, repel, and persist until you stop imagining them. Then we have our walls. More domain. They are unique but somewhat comparable to our dots. Immutability and the fact they border our world make them distinct. However, their ability to repel things and the fact that they persist until you stop imagining them make them similar to our dots. Let's table this idea of shared rules for now.¬†\n\nMost of you may think these two domains make up our world. However, some of you have identified that there is a third domain. The world itself. Or rather, the space our dots move through. Nothingness. The region that is bound by our walls. Its domain is defined by the fact dots can move through it, and how the walls bind it. The three domains paint a thorough picture of our world. But we are not done. If you have identified our fourth and final domain, you have the mind of an artificer. Perception. The fourth domain is the god-level domain. The rules that allow our world to be imagined, perceived, and altered by your mind.\n\nI hope some of you see where this is going. Though, I expect a great deal of you to feel that this is philosophical nonsense. Fear not. It will make sense in time. The main point I am illustrating is that our cosmos allows a spoon to exist in the same way we have created these dots. Luckily for us, our cosmos also allows us to play with the very rules a thing subscribes to.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Mortuum-Priums-1":{"title":"Weaving - Mortuum Priums - 1","content":"*The Dead Progenitor Expedition - Lead Researcher Jacklyn Spearhead's Log - Day 146*\n\nThe Mortuum Primus is indescribable. Unfortunately, describing it is the very task I've set out to do. My first three days in orbit consisted exclusively of staring wide-eyed, or tearing half-written pages out of my journal and casting them into the Astral Sea. I'm plagued by aphasia and awe. My vocabulary completely lacks the required terminology. Calling it \"vast\", \"eldritch\", or \"divine\" only points a finger in the direction of the necessary words which have yet to be invented. The only thing more immense that I can conceive of is space itself. An unfair comparison, but the best I can do to illustrate the sheer enormity of what I am witnessing. The fact our terrestrial telescopes haven't registered the object speaks wonders about Scarlet Nebula's obfuscating properties. In my travels, I've observed extraordinary cosmic entities, bizarre alien peoples, and twisted arcane worlds that have forced me to restructure my understanding of The Cosmos. This was all dwarfed by my arrival here.¬†\n\nTo witness the corpse of the progenitor god Goh'zul, a Wielder of First Power, is like peering through reality's keyhole and catching an afterimage of how all this came to be. Primordial splendor. I still cannot visualize a place or phenomenon that would spawn a being like this. However, imagining Goh'zul and entities like him skimming across the emptiness of space, painting The Cosmos with stars, planets, and realms, is not a far step from the sight before me. It's as nauseating as it is beautiful.\n\nI previously used the term \"orbit\" to describe our current bearing. While technically true, I feel it does not encapsulate what is currently happening. We are certainly within the entity's orbit, but still very much on approach and have been for the past three days. To put that into perspective, this speed of travel would get one from Vega-5 to Sargasso in less time than it would take to make a cup of tea. The view is life-changing‚Äì but it's still like waiting for a pot to boil. Professor Hal estimates his Gate Engine will get us close enough for early empirical observations in the next few days. Though even the Grand Physic seems to be doubting himself. It's particularly challenging to measure. Space, Gravity, and Time are always warped near a realm and The Mortuum Primus is the realm of realms. Additionally, all our calculations are based on The Law of Familiarity. Efficacy of magic and science scale with understanding. Both literally and figuratively. Being this far from The Crimson Enclave, or \"The Known Galaxy\" as many of our people still call it, makes folding space-time far more challenging than it already is.\n\nFortunately, this is not an uncommon hurdle for most worthwhile expeditions. Those who regularly astronavigate through deep Wildspace or the depths of the Scarlet will all tell you the same thing. Though, you'd likely have a hard time finding the latter. Traveling within the Scarlet Nebula is still considered suicide by most. However, this is based on old ways of thinking and superstition. Nowadays there are fairly decent star charts (thanks to our captain) and an encouraging amount of waystops within The Red. Sadly, affording resupplies in such places is a death of its own kind. To put it another way, popping in and out of The Scarlet Nebula on expedition is a more than feasible task. I should know as I have made a career of it.¬†\n\nNevertheless, traveling across The Scarlet Nebula is an entirely different beast. A task very fairly described as suicidal. Dozens have tried, but you can count the number of voyages that have successfully exited the nebula's furthest side on a single hand. Three different expeditions made by two separate Spelljammers. Or two and a half depending on who you ask.\n\n¬†One vessel, The Urd's Call, crossed the border on its first expedition but never returned. Its wreckage was found floating in the orbit of The Mortuum Primus during a rescue mission made by the more successful vessel. The crew of The Urd's Call were nowhere to be seen and there were no signs of a struggle. While eerie and dissuading, The Mortuum Primus must be explored. My expedition is the third time this \"more successful vessel\" has ventured into this region of space. It's said to be the strongest and fastest spelljammer in The Known Galaxy. It's no easy task to convince the captain and crew of The Dawnbreaker to lend their services. Fortunately, when you are royalty, the star pupil of Grand Physic Andro Hal, and the daughter of Master Sam Spearhead, batting your eyelashes can go a long way.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.041234758Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Mortuum-Priums-2":{"title":"Weaving - Mortuum Priums - 2","content":"*The Dead Progenitor Expedition - Lead Researcher Jacklyn Spearhead's Log - Day 150 - 1/2* \n\nOne of my instruments finally registered The Mortuum Primus today. Or rather, it finally registered what lies within The Mortuum Primus. Every piece of arcane equipment we brought, including my right arm, has suffered unruly levels of interference for two weeks now. It's a good thing I'm left-handed. I've lost count of the false positives we've experienced, which doesn't happen often as I have an eidetic memory. Regardless, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the real deal. I spotted the signal light on my Relmatic Scope glowing faint, alternating casts of green, yellow, and purple. This was considerably odd as it is a red diode. The glows quickly grew so bright that they became painful to look at. It's worth mentioning that brightness alone is not an uncommon occurrence. Past visits I have made to Aarou, a particularly energetic realm, have produced the same luminance. However, in the case of Aarou, it takes three to four hours for the glow to reach that level of intensity.¬†\n\nBefore I could make it to the device's eyepiece, a high-pitched series of whines, cracks, and pops emanated from the optical tube. All nineteen of the implement's lenses had shattered into exactly three pieces of varying sizes. Fortunately, I am quite clever. I predicted our journey may pose challenges such as this. I brought multiples of everything and already had a second Realmatic Scope, tuned to a different frequency, running in parallel. I should be able to find a suitable configuration somewhere between the two devices' frequencies. I'm currently writing this as my technicians disassemble the damaged instrument. In a moment I will configure the replacement based on what they find. But until then: tea and journaling.¬†\n\nWhile the event of our Realmatic Scope breaking was a moderately alarming occurrence, I find myself feeling quite optimistic. Never before has there been a more well-supported expedition. You could probably start a small university with all the supplies, staff, and experience I have on board. And if hazards of a more violent nature emerge, I am confident in our level of security. At least as confident as one from The Crimson Enclave could be. The crew of The Dawnbreaker have literally fought and beat divinities before. And the Captain's wife, Ruthena, is technically a Divinity herself. We are as ready as can be for whatever challenge the Mortuum Primus throws at us. It should be noted that my preparedness is not entirely solely based on experience and instinct. While the territory is unknown, we are not without a guide. Like most expectations I have for this journey, I founded my preparations on The Alliance Tome.\n\nI need not explain the wonders of The Tome to other academics. However, if this expedition is as successful as I am hoping it to be, I fully anticipate this journal to be published for historical significance. So I will make The Tome's importance understood by the less academically versed reader. Also, I am partial to gushing, and conspiratorial discussion.\n\nThe Alliance Tome was obtained from the Eethryil. The text was given to us by our alien neighbors after much coaxing. To put it simply, it contains the secrets of the universe. Sort of. It has become as instrumental to academia as the anvil is to smithing. But I am getting ahead of myself. Eethryl is a society comparable to our own. Merely more advanced. It resides within a cluster of habitable solar bodies we discovered three decades ago in Deep Wildspace. The Eethryli's civilizations initially astonished us. Science and magic developed far past our own. It was also the first time we encountered an alien society that had gods different than us. Not merely an alternate perspective of divinity, but an entirely separate, unrelated pantheon. A group of worlds that existed outside The Weave. To make my point clear, their magic came from somewhere we didn't understand. We were left frightened and perplexed by this discovery. Fortunately, the Eethryli are reasonably affable neighbors and didn't obliterate us. We spent the first years in awe of their majesty, but they kept us at arm's length. Like how an appreciative celebrity might keep an adoring fan a few paces away. They'd known of us long before we knew of them but did not interfere with our development due to Cosmic Law. A concept we would soon become familiar with. While the discovery of The Eethryli expanded our understanding of The Cosmos, we were only just beginning to glimpse the bigger picture.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of tentative communications with the Eethryli, we learned of their place in The Cosmos, and by extension, our own. Eethryl was part of The Cosmic Alliance, a federation of societies scattered across the stars that have discovered one another and formed, well, alliances. Sharing resources, technology, and most importantly information. While the Eethryli initially seemed to us like a great, wondrous nation, we eventually began to suspect that they are actually of relatively low importance to The Cosmic Alliance. Though, they would like us to believe otherwise. Their location within The Cosmos is quite remote relative to The Alliance's heart. Ours even more so. To put it another way, within our region of the stars, The Eethryli are the big fish in a small pond.¬†\n\nLike all organizations, The Cosmic Alliance has rules. And we have been able to learn a fair deal about them. From what we can tell, there are multiple entities within our universe like The Alliance, each with their own competing goals. The Alliance's mission seems to be one of natural order. Their regulations largely pertain to the protection and preservation of developing civilizations. They uphold the idea that societies that cannot venture into the stars on their own, or protect themselves from external forces should not be tampered with. It is unclear as to exactly why this is their mission, but we have a few working theories. My personal belief is that in The Cosmos's history, interference with lower societies manifested like a proverbial cancer. Singular domineering forces that swept across the stars shedding blood and stomping out the unique and valuable aspects of developing civilizations. This theory works in multiple ways as it can also could be viewed from another perspective. Perhaps they are banding together against a greater, malicious entity?\n\nSuffice it to say, the governing bodies of The Crimson Enclave wanted anything and everything that The Eethryli would give us, but little was provided. They would only provide familiar resources. Trade discussions were slow and we had nothing besides our art for trade. Which, to them, was novel at best. Based on Cosmic Law, they weren't comfortable giving us anything too scientifically advanced. They had everything that we had and more. This all changed when they learned about the Lumina Pearls harvested on Neptulon. Unbeknownst to us, resources with space-warping properties are valuable all across The Cosmos. Extremely valuable.¬†\n\nIf not for Cosmic Law, I'd bet the Eethryli would have annexed The Crimson Enclave solely to harness Lumina Pearls. However, a hypothetical hostile takeover wasn't even worth considering as one day they suddenly informed us we could become a part of their nation. Most governing bodies of The Known Galaxy were enthused by the idea of amalgamating with Eethryl. The Crimson Enclave was still a relatively new government and had experienced a fair deal of growing pains. The prospect of assimilation came as a shock to us. We assumed to be too primitive for them but Eethryl assured us that we lie somewhere between primitive and alliance-material. According to them, this sort of union was common across the stars. It seemed the Eethryli would take full advantage of The Crimson Enclave's disorder and eager naivety. It is only by pure luck that the noble house controlling the pearl trade is headed by the most skeptical, oleaginous man I have ever met. Lord Kentucky Gallahue.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Mortuum-Priums-3":{"title":"Weaving - Mortuum Priums - 3","content":"*The Dead Progenitor Expedition - Lead Researcher Jacklyn Spearhead's Log - Day 150 - 2/2*\n\nThe different accounts, rumors, and retellings of how Lord Gallahue conned The Eethryli and gained us The Alliance Tome probably outnumbers the tome's very own page count. And The Tome has 1248 pages. You would think I'd know the real story, being familiar with nearly half of the emissaries The Enclave sent on that expedition. Two of whom were my parents. Sadly, I do not. The meeting was said to be so loud, long, hectic, and intense that everyone remembers different details about it. Their claims cast a wide range of conflicting narratives, but there is a common thread at their core.¬†\n\nA little over nine years ago we were to begin assimilation discussions with Eethryl. Personally, I think our willingness here is our people's greatest shame. Though, I'm a scholar, not a politician. I should clarify that not every member of the council was enthusiastic about the decision. Our hands were, in a sense, tied as Eethryl was on track to make a formal declaration of closed borders if we did not assimilate. This is the intergalactic way of saying \"give us what we want or quit bothering us\". We also weren't sure they'd remain peaceful after the fact. In hindsight, it is easy to see the bluff that it was. However, at the time, it felt like our society was trying to hop on the last Spelljammer as it was leaving port.\n\nWe were oblivious of Eethryl's gambit. At least in every way that mattered. Because of this meeting's result, we now have good reason to doubt our neighbors and suspect Eethryl is keeping us a secret from the rest of The Cosmic Alliance. They are not our friends. We hope their scheming is because we meet some criteria for power of negotiation, or possibly even the criteria for joining the alliance ourselves. Eethryl doesn't want this to happen as, like I mentioned before, they are a relatively unimportant society on the cosmic scale. We expect this could change with control over The Lumina Pearl Trade. Our theory is they mean to play the gatekeeper of The Crimson Alliance, and everything that should come with that relationship. If they can assume power over us before we figure out what is being kept hidden, they can gain control without overtly breaking Cosmic Law.\n\nBut enough condemnation. We return to the proceedings of the assimilation meeting. The conference began and things were proceeding in favor of Eethryl. However, when Lord Gallahue took to the stand everything was turned on its head. Mind you, this was his first time meeting the foreigners. Lord Gallahue is a friendly, albeit weird person when unprovoked. But it is said that he screamed, wailed, sang, confused, accused, mocked, and flirted with the Eethryli emissaries. Order was called for‚Äî demanded by Eethryl, but none was given. As I said, no one's stories agree on the exact course of action he took as he was engaging in multiple, passionate conversations at the same time. Whatever Kentucky did, he overwhelmed the Eethryli. My best guess as to why he did this is he saw their pristine society and knew that they'd respond poorly to a surprise confusion tactic. However, when asked about his reasoning he provides little beyond \"I didn't like them\".\n\nRegardless of motive, his tactic worked. Lord Gallahue is either a genius or the luckiest and most aggressive man The Cosmos has ever seen. Kentucky transformed the formal Eethryli emissaries into a discordant orchestra of which he was the conductor. Factions, millennia old, turned against each other. Their decorum devolved and they began making competing offers with The Enclave. Their peerless society fell to even ground in an awkward heap. I have heard that his tactic caused three separate bouts of crying, two divorces, and one minor civil war amongst our otherworldly neighbors. Again, the validity of these claims is thin at best, but these are the stories people tell.\n\nAs the meeting progressed, Gallahue maneuvered the conversation further and further in our favor. This was at the cost of Eethryl's respect of course, but that was a fee we could afford. While Lord Gallahue was adept at wearing people down, the Eethryli never lost sight of their original goal: sure power over The Lumina Pearl Trade. At this point, Lord Gallahue had gotten them to admit that the Pearls would be used to better their alliance-merchant relationships. They wouldn't elaborate beyond that, but it was evident how important they were to Eethryl.¬†\n\nEvery offer posed to us was a path that would eventually lead to sacrificing sovereignty. Their different deals all provided gifts, forms of compensation, lengthy transition periods, and varying degrees of retained power. However, offered resources were still only the ones present in our worlds, and any authority left to us would merely be that of a figurehead. Their offers now had genuine merit but were still insulting.\n\nDespite the displeasures, their manipulative bids gave us a ledge to stand on. A slim one. The mere act of offering unknowingly gave us the most expensive thing in the universe. Information. Their hasty proposals allowed us to infer all we needed to know about intergalactic trade and policy. Eethryl is far more advanced, and wise in the ways of the universe, but easy living had made them soft. They were attempting to con a people whose stories, history, and economy are laden with piracy. And there is no honor amongst thieves. The keen ears on our side of the room began to pick up on a pattern as Kentucky fished for better offers. The only real things of value they had couldn't be given to us by the Alliance's laws.\n\nTo summarize, we quickly understood the key elements of the situation. Eethryl would not be satisfied without a deal, but they couldn't offer us something we didn't already have without breaking cosmic law. Their search for something that would make them more relevant to The Alliance had grown desperate. To Eethryl, status is of the utmost importance. Their supposedly great civilization had stooped to employ manipulation tactics, and it was evident they were inexperienced and insecure about their conduct. They feared The Cosmic Alliance's scrutiny and were treading lightly.¬†\n\nWe suspect their unctuous behavior would be frowned upon‚Äî possibly even punished. Until that meeting, there had always been a line they wouldn't cross. For example, Eethryl would not let us handle their technology, allow us to roam their worlds unattended, teach us their language, give us their medicine, or reveal information about other societies in The Alliance. The list goes on and on. Kentucky had pushed them to the point where their toes had begun to creep over that line. You can imagine The Enclave's elation when Eethryl suddenly made an exception to their laws. They did not budge on the items I have listed, but one area that was previously off-limits was suddenly used as a bargaining chip. The history of The Cosmos.\n\nThe idea was presented to us as a show of good faith. They were making \"an exception\" by allowing us to gain some benefits of joining The Alliance \"in advance\". It should be noted that to them, joining The Alliance meant assimilation with Eethryl. Based on what we understand about Cosmic Law, they committed an illegal act here as a last-ditch effort to assume control. Sadly, we have no way to know how severe this infraction is. Regardless, not only would this give us information, but a sliver of power over them. The trade's associated conditions reinforced this. We could not pass the information along to other societies, we could not speak to the rest of the Alliance about this deal in the future, and we even had to limit its distribution within our worlds. They had no real way to police the latter, so we went on to ignore this rule.\n\nIt is both to Lord Gallahue's credit and discredit that he spat on this offer the same as all the others. His drama hid the expressions of academics in the room who would've given their left hand for any cosmic secret. All present scholars looked to High Archivist Jemseg, their superior and my lovely grandmother, with pleading eyes. Not dissimilar to how children beg for a puppy. Fortunately, the equally excited High Archivist was wise and reserved in the moments to follow. She let Kentucky go at them for another few minutes before calling for a recess. Supposedly they only got Lord Gallahue off the podium when the Grand Phsyic made him weightless and the triton royal was pulled from the hall like a fitful balloon.\n\nOn their way to the caucus chamber, members of The Crimson Enclave's emissaries were independently hatching different versions of the same plan. Eethryl had lost its reputation as our advanced, paradisic neighboring society. Their dishonesty was now evident, and they meant to take advantage of us. Unfortunately, The Enclave was not in a place to discuss countermeasures. They were in enemy territory, and could only assume they were being watched.¬†\n\nThere is an old Spelljammer captain's saying. It's used as a command when one's smaller ship encounters a larger, more fearsome enemy vessel. Cut and run. They were the only words offered by Sigfried Ren, captain of the Dawnbreaker during the recess. A vague suggestion, but fortunately our people's dependency on astronautical vessels meant everyone knew what he was hinting at. Get what we can, and get out.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-My-Yoke":{"title":"Weaving - My Yoke","content":"\"How *dare* you‚Ä¶\" Giriam's reprimand came quiet and breathy. Unable to process the sight before him. The body of Alz, God of Warfare hung lifeless in his grasp. Giriam craned his neck skyward. Gaze black with murderous‚Äî genocidal rage. Alleran hovered motionless above the battlefield, returning his stare. She hung relaxed, but ready for what would come next. She had killed a god. *A god?!*\n\n\"How ***dare*** you!?\" This time it came as a roar. The towering god stood as he let Alz' lifeless body tumble to the mud below. \"You're mortal. *Mortal*! Arrogant worms!\"¬†\n\nThe distant faces of mountains crumbled. Shorn free by his rage. Alleran held despite the fearsome condemnation. She was brave, Giriam had to give her that. Brave, and stupid. He'd come when he'd sensed something had happened to Festae, and fallen directly into the mortals' trap. Apparently, even they weren't immune to The Mortal Coil.\n\n\"You think yourselves valiant? Look what you've done! Look how far you've strayed. How can this be better than what was written?\" Giriam scowled at the armies. At this distance their numbers painted the hills like crops. Hairs on a stone fruit. More men than ever before in Zol's history, standing ready to die.\n\nAt the front of it all stood their champions. Mortals that once embodied The Watcher's vision. Wordbearers. Not all had betrayed them in the end, but the vast majority had come on this day. Leading them was Alleran, hero of five words, their foremost king. What a joke.\n\nGiriam shot a disdainful look down at Alz. God of Warfare. Ha! While Alz had been a fellow deity he had not been a peer. The young god was weak. Weak! Had he pulled his yoke and not cowed in fear at The Wanderer's hollow threats none of this would have come to pass. Now Alz' tools were lost in his death. How many words, fragments of cosmic power gone to such a careless act.\n\n\"Fine.\" Giriam spat the word after a long terrible moment, stepping over Alz's body like any other corpse. \"Fine. If this is what you want, then so be it. Who am I to deny your contest?\" The towing god outstretched his arm, armies cringing at the motion. His polychromatic robes caught the light of the setting sun as Giriam focused in on his bond. His connection to the pantheon. The others were coming, but they wouldn't be fast enough to stop him.\n\nNone of the Words within Giriam's Yoke were meant for battle. The other's feared him. They'd had concerns about giving one such as he a weapon. And while Giriam didn't need a weapon to fell this army, a lesson was far overdue.¬†\n\nHe found it. Swimming amongst the golden power of his comrades. They probably didn't even know a Word could be stolen like this. There'd never been a reason to before today.\n\n\"Those who stayed in your cities. The sick. The young. Those too scared to fight. Even those who still hold true to The Watcher's light. None will be allowed to hide on this day. All will be tried.\" Giriam made a fist as he ripped the word from Ayamot. There would surely be repercussions but he didn't care. For the first time Alleran flinched. She was the only mortal savvy enough to realize something was wrong. They'd hoped to face the docile god of agriculture next. They'd be sadly disappointed.\n\nGiriam raised his closed fist, snapping his nine fingered hand at the apex. The deep toll of a bell rung through the valley as behind him a shape appeared in the sky. Impossibly instant. A great, white wheel.\n\n\"You adopt your Words as identities. As if they themselves become your purpose. Your Yoke. You lose yourself in them like a carpenter lost in a hammer.\" Giriam could feel the other gods closing in now. It was too late. Today would be the last day for these blasphemers. This day would be their undoing.\n\n\"You, my horrid children. So lost in your ways‚Ä¶\" His voice was thick with contempt but wavered off, adopting a more melancholy lilt, \"But I suppose I am the one to blame.\"¬† He gave the mortal armies one last, wistful look. \"The world of men has always been my responsibility. My burden. My yoke.\"\n\nBehind him the wheel loomed. The colossal, ringed campus of building-like structures. The physical manifestation of a Word. It gave slight, but exact rotation. Like a single actuation of a gear. It's spokes moving firmly to take the place of their direct neighbor. The unseen bell tolling its movement once more.\n\n\"***Judgement***.\" Giriam spoke in The First Tongue.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-OId-Friend":{"title":"Weaving - OId Friend","content":"Six years ago\n\nA gentle, icy breeze skated across the frozen, endless landscape. Visible only as powdered veils of blown snow and the tousling of dark, shoulder-length curls. Cold stung at his skin, outlining countless scars where the sensation was duller. The lively wind and swirling squalls were a contrast to his immortal, taxed soul. He felt more tired and ancient than the surrounding stones. He probably was.\n\nSupreme power did not change the fact that, at his core, he was a simple man who yearned for peace‚Äî for life. It had been ever kept from him. Instead, the privilege of tranquility had been sacrificed to the Cosmos' identical, insatiable need. With each passing age the warrior, clad in tarnished gold plate, felt as if he were regressing to that bygone version of himself. Like how his ever-present companion must perpetually feel.\n\nHe looked to him, about ten paces away. A black stain of wicked, jagged armor against the otherwise white, snow-covered ruins. An inverted image of himself. The silent figure had a perpetually menacing presence. Yet there was a peaceful innocence in the way he stared up at the gently falling flakes of ice. Childlike. Somehow both pitiful and enviable all at once.\n\nHe could pity his stoic friend because he knew his suffering intimately. The undead had been forced to bear the burdens of gods long before becoming one himself. Despite that, his resolve was enviable. Legendary. The terrible sentinel was the embodiment of an oath kept against all odds.\n\nThe two of them had once been the same being, diverged now by transcendent power. Two versions of one man, made gods. He, the golden champion had broken their religious oaths, giving rise to the cursed being before him. They'd renounced their god not out of pride, but duty. To take on a burden far greater than any doctrine demanded. Sometimes one promise must be sacrificed for another.¬†\n\nThe decision forced him on a journey of pain, terror, and companionship. The vessel before him fought to the literal end of his world. Carrying the desires of gods, the world of men, and the shackles of madness. He couldn't have done it all on his own of course. He, and his friends, had saved their world from annihilation, and broken a power far beyond understanding.¬†\n\nTheir reward? A new oath. One far, far heavier than any they'd carried before. An immortal existence, wandering The Cosmos, fighting uncountable versions of the same battle time and time again. Defending mortals from meddlesome gods. An endless war that had led them right back to where they'd started. A corpse left in their wake. Goh'zul.\n\nA familiar presence of immense power moved at the cusp of the ruins. Its approach was soon accompanied by footsteps crunching through the snow. An expected visitor.\n\n\"Old friend.\" The wizened warrior's voice grumbled warmly as he approached. Agon turned to face him and despite the turmoil within, could not help but crack a smile.¬†\n\nThe arrival was a mountain of a man, sporting a magnificent beard and tree-trunk-like arms. The artist's vision of a battle-scarred berserker. The giant bore no shirt and had on a headdress made from a bear's pelt‚Äî skull worn like a helmet\n\nThe two gods crossed the distance and embraced as brothers. Fang released him and gave an affable nod to Ra'Queen who'd stop staring at the wintry haze to look at them. Red eyes a dull, unreadable glow. Ra'Queen returned an enthusiastic wave. Slightly silly in contrast to his otherwise dangerous aura. Fang and Agon shared a look. Melancholy. Difficult times had come upon them.\n\n\"Have you spoken to any of the others yet?\" Fang asked as he meandered through the open ruins. It had once been an amphitheater but was now just a nameless, forgotten place Agon used for contemplation.\n\n\"No.\" Agon sighed. Then, after a pause asked the burning question. \"Was Giriam in breach of the treaty?\" Giriam had once been allowed to act outside their accord. A mistake made in unprecedented circumstances. It wouldn't be surprising to learn Giriam's death was a result of overstepping.\n\n\"Kaszu and Persanius don't think so, but Raven is making sure of it. They think it was the mortals.\" Fang shook his head, taking a seat on a felled stone column. Agon nodded in appreciation. While he wasn't exactly glad about the deicide, he could appreciate the difficulty of killing a god as a mortal. Fang continued before Agon could respond, \"Crackle and Saldrin think we should go to war.\"\n\nAgon rubbed at his neck with contemplative relief, \"Not surprising.\" He said, leaning against an opposite, still-standing pillar. \"What killed him?\"\n\n\"Slave Relic,\" Fang said the words with gravity, but there was a hint of amusement in his tone.\n\nAgon let out a singular, genuine laugh of surprise. \"Serves him right.\" Fang returned a small, pleased huff of his own. Unfortunately, comedic justice was not enough to overpower the day's grim severity.\n\nWhispering wind became the dominant sound once more. Filling the space for a long, weighty moment before Agon spoke again. \"Have any of us spoken to them yet?\"\n\n\"No.\" Fang responded darkly, \"Yanneran won't even respond to Cadence nor The Weaver to Hercan.\" He added with a small, unsure gesture.¬†\n\nIt was the worst-case scenario. The Wandering Gods had intervened on Zol to stop the most volatile dynamic between mortal and god they'd ever witnessed. They were warriors by nature, but their aim was diplomacy. Giriam's death was the furthest thing from their goal.¬†\n\nTheir mission was to preserve the organic, mortal way of life, while still allowing for divine influence. Accomplished most often by rules that protect culture, defend philosophy, and prevent gods from entering conflict. Followed of course by lessons that taught morals and balance. Balance was a far cry from this world.¬†\n\nAgon considered as he gazed upon the harsh, bleak landscape around him. Zol's gods were violent, stubborn, and famously powerful. They were why most of The Cosmos steered clear of The Great Old One's corpse. The Wandering God's first few millennia on Zol had been tense but after a fashion, a compromise was made. Forced really. Mundane ways of life were guarded, but that was all that could be agreed upon. Worse, The Watcher had been allowed to continue any war already underway and retaliate against any new attacks.\n\nShould The Watcher breach their agreements, The Wandering Gods would call upon their allies from all across the stars, triggering a divine war for Zol. Unfortunately, Agon and the other Wandering Gods were also bound by these rules. They'd gained their allies by proving their morals across The Cosmos. Should they contradict their own terms, they'd lose that support. Not just out of principle, but divine agreement. The Wanderers would be forced to fight The Zolaen Gods all on their own.\n\n\"Fearsome gods made caged animals.\" Agon ran his hand through his hair, brushing away snow.\n\nTheir original agreement with The Zolaen Gods had been unproductive. The Watcher could not be divorced from his vision. To make matters worse, a horrific event had transpired two ages ago. Mortals had found a weapon from The Wandering God's homeworld, Artea. A blade of pure Morhin‚Äî The sword that'd eviscerated Ysra. Its implementation on Zol had resulted in apocalypse and the near binding of The Zolaen Gods. A wound that when compounded with The Wandering Gods Rules, left The Watcher and his pantheon with an exposed weakness.\n\n\"Something's going to give.\" The enormous man watched as flakes of fallen snow melted in the palm of his hand.¬†\n\nDespite all their efforts to cultivate peace in Zol, they only ever drifted further and further from the idea. In other worlds they would have hoped their rivals to be more cooperative when faced with the death of one of their own. Unfortunately, they knew The Zolaen Gods all to well. Nothing was as morally immovable as Zol. They'd all but restrained The Trinity's Gods, and an opporunist had stuck a knife in Giriam.\n\nAgon laughed mirthlessly, \"So you come to me the, The Oathbreaker.\"¬†\n\nFang held his gaze for a long moment. \"We will have to make a decision, and I'd appreciate your wisdom.\"\n\n\"I don't have answers for you, Fang. Maybe once I would have‚Ä¶\" Agon trailed off wistfully, realizing that wasn't the truth. He did have an answer, just one he didn't want to admit. \"I am tired of watching them die.\"\n\nFang let out a slow, sympathetic sigh. Its warmth and power melted away the surrounding, late winter snow. Revealing early spring beneath. It was a pain The Wanderers knew all too well, the greatest challenge of their lot. Not the endless passing of time, the ever-present threat of rival gods, or even the daunting future of endless wandering. It was the loss.¬†\n\nThe fact that in their journey they'd been forced to watch mortal souls be snuffed out time and time again. Artists, scholars, leaders, and heroes that met their end because their creator willed it. People who would have lived stories of adventure, and passion. Souls shaped like friends. The very reason The Wandering Gods did what they did.\n\nMany mortals were going to die, regardless of of what happened next. However, it might be possible to mitigate these deaths if The Wandering Gods took action soon. Took action, and got lucky that is. Doing so could protect Zol, but would shred their treaty, and burn bridges with any ally who could help against The Zolaen Gods. It was an impossible descision. One at the end of a long, long strand of impossible decisions. Torturous. These were the very emotions that provoked most gods to meddle.\n\nA hand fell on Agon's shoulder. His eyes met Ra'Queen's level gaze, sensing the same emotions within the silent killer. Neither would have the answer, but there was one thing they did have. A lifetime of enduring a cursed, torturous quest.\n\n\"We wait.\" Agon started, suddenly feeling the sparks of Ra'Qeen's resolve‚Äî his resolve. \"We wait, for now.\"","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Scriptures-of-Nothing-1":{"title":"Weaving - Scriptures of Nothing - 1","content":"We were their chosen.

The heat was a meager thing, but he liked how it mixed with the open balcony's cool spring air. The way it clashed. A dance that became a singular, surging sensation as the conflicting atmosphere fought for domination over his Riftkeep lodgings.\n\n\"So what lies next for you, Inheritor Nallian?\" Gideon floated the question into the open sky beyond the balcony's railing. The silver-masked man had been surveying Tenzentak's arduous recovery for the last half hour now. Haith didn't give any indication that he'd heard. The young warrior merely sat there, slumped in a chair, speculatively turning the melted head of a warforged in his hands.\n\nHe hadn't decided as to why he'd taken the remnant. It wasn't even a real warforged. The head had belonged to one of those weasel's creations. The distinction didn't seem to matter to Haith. He knew that it theoretically should‚Äî these ones didn't have souls. Perhaps that was why he was drawn to it; the fact they were the same to him should theoretically make him feel guilty. But, he was too tired for that. Too tired for a while now.\n\nThe different casts of automaton held the same value in his eyes. The same value as anyone he slew, regardless of flesh or steel. Haith often saw himself in those he fought‚Äî futile stands made against the force that drove him. He hated them for that. None of the clashes he'd been in over the last six years felt like a fight. Only slaughter. However, this last one had been slightly different. Different in a much more annoying way. Slaughter with extra steps.\n\n\"Why did we do all of this?\" The words found their way to Haith's mouth before he could properly weigh the question.\n\n\"Hm?\" Gideon spun from the city to face him. The mask he wore today, etched in scale-like patterns, caught the flicking light of the fireplace, granting him a vaguely draconic appearance.\n\nHaith stopped turning the head over in his hands but didn't look up at Gideon. \"Why did we go to such lengths? I could have done away with Colin Loin in‚Ä¶ an hour.\"¬†\n\n\"Colin *Coinge*\" Gideon corrected. Haith made a curt, uncaring gesture. As if the mistake had only emphasized his point. Haith set down the head and joined Gideon on the balcony. His movements were smooth and powerful. Emboldened by the gift of flame itself.\n\n\"If we needed him to fail, why allow him to get so close to succeeding?\" Gideon went to speak but Haith shot up a silencing hand. He knew what Gideon was going to say, but didn't want to hear it. Gideon waited for him to put his hand down, and said it anyway.\n\n\"A truer world.\" It was their mantra. Three words upon which the whole world turned. A noble mission, one that Haith had gotten sick of. He tried to hide his dispassion. *Needed* to hide it, but it was growing more and more difficult with each passing day.\n\nThe dark, inquisitive pits in Gideon's mask watched the boy contemplatively. Haith was one of the most powerful warriors in The Three Corners, but lying was not a skill he'd ever had to hone.\n\n\"Why do you think it took so long for us to kill Giriam?\" Gideon posed the question with casual ease, but the words immediately caused Haith's back to straighten. The sudden mention of ultimate blasphemy was like a splash of ice-cold water. One did not speak of this. The slow turn of Haith's head was like a heavy millstone, eyes wide with shock and appallment. The subject didn't seem to phase Gideon at all.\n\n\"I'm‚Ä¶ not supposed to talk about that‚Äî to know about that.\" Haith's usually stoic demeanor had been peeled away, exposing the scared youth within. \"Valmore could kill us for this.\"\n\n\"Would you like me to stop talking about it?\" Gideon cocked his head. Haith's silence was apprehensive, but he didn't withdraw.\n\n\"Then I ask you again. Why do you think it took so long for us, a group of mere mortals, to kill Giriam?\" The question was unfairly broad, slightly rhetorical, and complex, but Haith couldn't pass up the opportunity to discuss it. The topic had been eating at him for years now. Eating at the whole world. Haith's knowledge of what his people did and why was intentionally limited by his betters. He hadn't even been sure they'd truly done it. That a Zolaen god could have actually been killed. As it were, Gideon's question implied that everything his organization had done was coordinated to kill Giriam. Which couldn't be the truth‚Ä¶ could it?\n\nHaith contemplated for a long while before speaking. Gideon, frustrating as he was, always spoke in games and riddles. Haith would get more out of him if he played a game of his own. \"We're not mortals.\"\n\n\"I give you the opportunity to discuss the greatest question of the modern age, and you want to talk about existential philosophy? Philosophy forbidden amongst our ranks at that.\" The silver mask betrayed no emotion, but there was a faint smile in Gideon's words. Most would think Haith was being arrogant, but Gideon knew the boy was smarter than people gave him credit for. Haith gave a slight shrug. \"Very well. I suppose if we are breaching confidentiality we may as well hold other rules in similar regard. If not mortals, then what are we in your eyes? Immortals? Gods?\"\n\n\"I saw you take a spear to the heart only yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can die. I'm just worse at it than most.\" Gideon chuckled. \"What about you? Let's speak hypothetically. Say I task you to pick up your sword and kill everyone in Tenzentak right now. Could you do it? If you are not a mortal, any number of lesser beings shouldn't be a concern should it?\"\n\nHaith weighed the logistics for a moment. \"No. If I'm lucky I'd get nearly an eighth and that's a generous estimate. The Guild would be able to trap me. Kill me, maybe.\" There was no shame in his words. Haith didn't have any delusions about his power. \"And many would probably escape.\"\n\n\"So how would you do it? If you had to, I mean.\"\n\nHaith shifted his posture, betraying a hint of annoyance. \"I see where you're going with this, Gideon. I would need planning, tactics, allies, deception.\"\n\n\"Mortality is a matter of perspective. A matter of stakes.\"\n\n\"So everything before the Ahamatath‚Ä¶ truly was done to kill Giriam?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"H- How?\" The ineffective question forced its way from Haith's lips.\n\n\"Look at Colin Coinge's efforts. The world wouldn't accept the truth as he saw it. So he had to maneuver them.\"\n\n\"Look where that got him.\" Haith nodded towards the four craters of Belzan Tower, arranged like the incomplete petals of a flower.\n\n\"Nothing compared to what we've done. The losses we've faced. You know that.\" Gideon's words were mournful as he gazed out into The Grand Nothing.\n\nHaith had only had pieces of the story. Speculations, rumors, and the fragments he'd been told. The implications behind Gideon's words gave weight to Haith's darkest theories. Gideon pushed away from the balcony and strode for the door to Haith's chamber.\n\n\"You look upon this last week with scrutiny, but this our lot, dear Inheritor. And while it may feel foolish now, you'll look back upon it soon with understanding. Our master does not delegate imprecisely. The fact the need for your usual violence has been given more,\" Gideon searched for the right word. \"Specificity‚Äî means that you have been given a greater purpose. Not a lesser one.\"","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-That-and-A-Lot-More":{"title":"Weaving - That and A Lot More","content":"Rubic landed hard on his back, skidding slightly across the wet floor of the cell. Its metal door was slammed in his face as he forced himself to his feet, not staying down for more than a second. His body protested, but the act wasn't over just yet. The young man rushed the bars with such speed that they reverberated as he rammed up against them.\n\n\"That all the time you have for me today, you ugly-ass stump?!\" Rubic punctuated his fury by spitting in the direction of the casually retreating guard. The guard, whose flesh was textured and colored exactly like tree bark, didn't look back. He tried to play it off, but Rubic knew he'd gotten under this one's skin. A small win. Once the disturbingly beautiful tree-like man was out of sight, Rubic allowed his bravado to deflate. It hurt to breathe. The guards, by law, weren't allowed to maim prisoners. However, Rubic's bullheadedness could push anyone past their limit, especially if he was explicitly trying to piss them off. It hadn't taken Rubic long to persuade them to make an exception to their \"no violence law\". Good. He needed to keep their attention. He would do whatever was necessary so long as they weren't watching Ventril.\n\nNot that there was much to spot about the old man. At least in Rubic's opinion. In any other circumstance, Rubic probably would have thought this to be the stupidest, most pointless, and unfair task for him. But he'd do anything for Ventril. He owed him that and a lot more. Rubic would never say it out loud, of course. And he groaned each time Lora or Ronan asked him to distract the guards. But, he was glad to be able to help, even if that meant taking beating after beating.\n\nRubic raised the hem of his grey prisoner's tunic above his midsection, revealing porcelain skin bruised in alarming, colorful shades.\n\n\"Fucking hell.\" He hissed.\n\n\"You okay, kid?\" Ronan, stoic as ever, stepped out from a doorway behind him. Their cell wasn't like most across The Three Corners. Rather than a single room, its floor plan was more like an entire wing of a mansion. A wet, dark, and uncomfortable mansion where the east wall was completely replaced by bars making privacy almost non-existent.\n\n\"Oh yeah! Doing just‚Ä¶ super awesome!\" Rubic let his shirt fall back around him.\n\n\"I'll take the next one.\"\n\n\"Nah they wouldn't buy your shitty act. 'Sides, I think I'm starting to find my True Form!\" Rubic paused to wince, trying to roll his shoulder. \"Black and blue...\"\n\nRonan nodded solemnly. Rubic expected him to say some retort about \"attitude\" or \"mission\" but he didn't. Ronan opened his mouth to speak again but was interrupted by an approaching individual from deeper within the cell.\n\n\"Come quick!\" Olsen's whisper came from the dark doorway where Ronan had entered. Rubic turned to spot her. The young woman's symmetrical face was somewhere between concern and eagerness. Each time Rubic had caught a glimpse of her since their capture, he was shocked to see how pristine, and elegant she remained despite their squalor. Was she always that beautiful?\n\nThe two of them followed Olsen as quickly as circumstances allowed. Swiftly, but not urgently. They had to make sure the guards suspected nothing besides the monotony of prison life. A moment later they arrived at the cusp of one of the few private nooks within their cell. Rubic braced himself for the sight.\n\nVentril had always seemed immutable to Rubic. More a fixture than a mortal man. To see him bedridden, coated in a sheen of sweat, and shaking weakly was like a knife to the gut every single time. Before Ventril, Rubic never thought he would get much from his sad, little life. Living more out of defiance than anything else. But one day, out of nowhere, this silly, old scholar appeared in their lives with a plan more futile than trying to pull the sun from the sky.\n\nThey probably would have dismissed him if not for his contagious passion. The rest of them never truly thought their plan would go anywhere. At least at first they didn't. Nightly meetings in that sad, little shop became a reason for living. Laughter, food, and friendship. Years and years of trying to complete a seemingly impossible task gave rise to something more true and beautiful than anything Rubic could ever put into words. Purpose. Rubic never had a father, but he had Ventril.\n\n\"What's happening?\" Ronan spoke skeptically, trying not to get his hopes up.\n\n\"He started talking again. Still just random words.\" Lora nervously picked at the skin on her lip as she stood over Venrtil's bed. His eyes moved like that of a dreamer's.\n\nA small part of Rubic thought this was a pathetic thing they were doing. Ventril was old. Truthfully, Rubic didn't know how old, but the man had likely just‚Ä¶ lost it when everything fell apart. They stood over a dying, senile man's bed praying for a miracle. Praying for anything. Long ago, this part of Rubic, the one that viewed the world with skepticism, had ruled him. It made him nihilistic, and unexcitable. Today, that part of him was no stronger than a slight breeze. Years of trust, and trying had atrophied his fear. Each time the guards had struck him over the past week, they unknowingly beat the remaining weakness from his body. He would protect Ventril. Ventril would save them. He had to.\n\nSuddenly the body in the bed froze. Breath caught in each of their chests, assuming the worst. For a long moment, no one spoke.\n\n\"Gideon Gain.\" The bedridden hero whispered. Voice devoid of weakness.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Antisequence-1":{"title":"Weaving - The Antisequence - 1","content":"The bullet rips through your jaw, tearing flesh and shattering teeth. It feels fitting, this. You can't recall the last time your head was above water. Mistake after mistake. A being of small means, forced to reach beyond them simply to make do. Like a fly trapped indoors, buzzing against window panes. A futile attempt to escape the life you had wriggled into. Thank the gods someone was finally able to squash you. There is no pain. In that strange fragment of a moment, the only physical sensation you note is the slight recoil of your stance. As if someone had given you a firm, one-fingered push where your bottom front teeth met your gums. Your posture sways, accounting for the impact. A final reflex after the bullet leaves the back of your neck, severing your spinal cord. A perfect kill shot. Almost admirable. The paralysis could even be seen as merciful, sparring you the agony of your detached body drowning in its own blood. To you, a mercy like this might seem lucky given your history. The Cosmos didn't spare you from pain often. Unfortunately, you do not have the luxury of considering luck at this moment. You begin to die.\n\nYour eyes lock on the pitch-dark alleyway where your anonymous killer stands, vision still glowing with the afterimage of a muzzle flash. The world blurs. Gravity steals you downwards, but instead of crumpling at your feet, the ground swallows you. Like how one might imagine walking through a mirror. On the other side, you rise to see the alleyway changed. Not only flipped, but its darkness shifts and writhes. The shade once cast by the adjacent building is no longer a shadow, but an enormous, lumbering being. It glides towards you, growing larger than a house. A broad, skeletal creature with a head like a three-eyed ox skull, the rest of its form hidden beneath a thick black cloak made from wispy feathers. In its seven-fingered hands, an enormous, wicked farmer's scythe. You know who this is, everyone does. Its approach ends in a slow, graceful motion, readying to strike.\n\n\"I am sorry.\" Death's multi-voiced speech meets your ears like that of an old friend. Pained. Its words carry an unceremonious impression as if Death has omitted a piece of this sacred ritual. The reliving of one's past. A thing better left unvisited. You consider this final kindness as the scythe passes through your form. At least it was quick. Death's perfect blade slices through you like air, its tip catching something at your core and tearing it free. The sensation of your soul leaving its vessel is like taking off a heavy boot after a long day's work. But there is something else, a second sensation. You are unsure if it's some influence of this god or your own memory, but you recall a fragment of your sorry life. Not a memory in full, just a feeling. Warm embrace, cooking stew, and brewing yeast.\n\nThe world around you is blasted apart as if struck by some impossible sandstorm. Buildings disintegrate, and the ocean is blown away like dew on a windy morning. Unyielding destruction. Your body unravels into ribbons, barely clinging to your skewered soul fluttering in the great shockwave of death. The Coilwalker propels you into The Ethos, and the Mortal Coil takes hold of you once more. Its embrace comes somehow familiar. A welcome end to a long, hard life. The stars blur and the moons explode into a menagerie of strange colorful animals as you soar towards your next becoming. The last strands of what you were flutter behind you like the ribbon of a dancer. You almost forget them. As you burn the sky like a comet, the animals, suspended in nothing, hunt each other in radially symmetric patterns in consummate, bloody dance. Kaleidoscopic. The stars bleed into lines, connecting to form the peaks of bottomless mountains. The mortal threads that bind you release one by one until your final attachment is no greater than a hair's width.¬†\n\nSuddenly, the last piece of you goes taught. Your journey through the brilliant beyond suddenly stalls as if someone had grabbed that tiny thread and restrained you like a dog on a leash.\n\nThen it begins to pull on you, backward. Relentless. You resist, but whatever wills your return is determined. As you recede, the Mortal Coil pulls opposite, making you the rope in some terrible tug-of-war. The Coil is ancient and immutable, but it is merely a force. A natural process, patient and not compelled by victory. As you are yanked from its grasp it leaves your soul scarred. Marring you with its awesome power. You hurtle back towards reality, pulled by a thread. With each passing moment, the lost threads and ribbons reattach themselves to you; they cling to your soul and pull on it. Like two dozen hands trying to drown you in deep water. Pulling you under. The threads weave and stitch themselves, enveloping you, becoming your flesh once more.\n\nYou awaken to find your body slumped against a wall in some unfamiliar, moonlit street. Your memories of the beyond grow thin like a dream at dawn. Your hand shoots towards your jaw. Its covered in blood and marked with a wide scar where your face had split. You are otherwise unharmed. Your tongue feels around a mouth of restored teeth. With the taste of blood in your mouth you look up to see Dairo standing above you, hand outstretched. Wisps of dark light curl between his fingers before vanishing.\n\n\"He brought me back? He never brings us back.\" You think to yourself, not believing the site before you.\n\n\"Up.\" Your merciless master commands.\n\n\"Wh- what happened? Where are the others?\" You rise, scanning your surroundings for the other Dogs and possible threats.\n\n\"They died.\"\n\n\"All of them?\" Your hand raises to your forehead, dizzy. Dairo doesn't respond, he just turns and begins walking down the alleyway, expecting you to follow. You take a hesitant step after him, then realize your face is uncovered. Your iron dog mask had fallen off in the chaos. The panic of losing it is only momentary as you spot it lying on the cobbles a few strides away. You stoop to pick it up, but Dairo stops you.\n\n\"Leave it.\" He instructs coldly. You freeze, inches away from picking up the mask. After a pause, you right your posture. Then it strikes you. You died a slave and were returned by your master. Legally, you are free. A million possibilities stream through your muddled mind. Run, scream, sing, dance, cry, thank Diaro, or maybe even try to kill him. Your mind can't seem to decide and locks itself in place. The sense of uncertainty consumes you. You have no idea what to do with your life. You have no life. You died a long, long time ago. This was no resurrection. At least not in any way that matters. Before you consciously decide anything, you take a step in Diaro's direction. Then another. You follow your master all the way back to the canal, still obedient but no longer a slave. You don't know what you are now.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Antisequence-2":{"title":"Weaving - The Antisequence - 2","content":"The sequence comes to you more frequently these days in large, more coherent pieces rather than the usual flashes. Returning memories of death still haunt you, despite them never actually occurring. By now you assume that your failure in Kosskazoka was expected. Neither Dairo nor the few of his betters you'd met since bore concern for, let alone mourned the loss of your fellow slaves. Whatever that mission was, it seemed your dispatchment had been a calculated risk. Either that or a snap strategic response. Likely, those criminals held something feared, or desired by The University and your life had been worth the risk.\n\n'Had' being the key word there. Dairo never clarified why he'd brought you, and only you back. When he reported his doing so to his direct superior, an arcanist named Tserlbane, the aged man had chuckled at the notion. As if you were a novelty of sorts. The new arrangement was not explained in plain terms either, but Dairo expected you'd serve as his apprentice. It's possible you could have rejected him. You didn't.\n\nA lost dog led by a cruel keeper into the depths of the West's dark secrets. You learned that the program, which you had until recently been a part of, called the 'Faceless Initiative', had been shut down after the bulk of its members were killed. Tserlbane was sending Dairo, and by extension, you on a new mission serving the same cause that had already taken your life once before. Frustratingly, no one would tell you what that *cause* was.\n\nA train brought you to the familiar city of Audran. Fortunately, you weren't required to stay within its walls. Your time there was spent in a small, isolated villa far from the city proper. The following five seasons involved the most grueling training of your life. Both physically and mentally. Your salvation from death proved to be no mercy. Dairo made your life a living hell. But he also made you stronger, faster, smarter, and ruthless. Your knowledge of magic accelerated far beyond what you'd previously thought possible. At first, you learned to do things once out of reach. Then, things that put you in the discomforting reach of the law. Finally, you were taught things you'd previously not known were even possible.\n\nThese events are frustratingly broken to you now. The trauma is there, but the skills are not. You hold only scraps that come to you in the form of surprise talent, or discovered muscle memory. They'd be remarkably useful if you could access them in full. But from what little you recall, perhaps they are better left, for lack of a better term, unremembered. \n\nIn a little more than a year's time, Dairo sculpted you into something that could have easily bested your past slave self using martial arts alone. The young boy from the southern sands is forgotten by this version of you. Pushed deep inside to become a roiling sea of rage and molten glass. Your core became so amorphous that revenge and destruction lost their unique identities. You became a cold, unfeeling shell that only unleashes the horror within at Dairo's command.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Antisequence-3":{"title":"Weaving - The Antisequence - 3","content":"You recall your training coming to an abrupt end, like a meal confiscated before the final bites.

A terrible audience of lost souls. None of them seem to enjoy the macabre display.\n\nFor years you kill, destroy, and dismantle at The University's command. A perfect solider. Scars paint your skin, and your once curious eyes sink into deep, gloomy wells. It is far from a peaceful life, but there is calm within your resignation. A white-noise-like serenity.\n\nYou settle into this rock bottom with permanency. Like a fossil folded into sediment. But a subtle stirring flickers to life amongst the nothingness. As blight blooms in still water, your ever-asking mind twitches to life, latching on to a question. Why? Why, does an influential, powerful, and legitimate organization like The University have so many fringe concerns? Legitimate, yet minor foes. Quarries with individuals, essentially nobodies, tampering with dangerous magic in the forgotten corners of society. On paper, they seek to create order or enact justice from the ruling class. The bodies in your wake tell a different story.\n\nYou do not seek with intention, but answers stick to your question like flies in honey. A whisper here, an inference there. It paints a picture of something sinister. Mortals playing god. The University somehow knows things they shouldn't, or are possibly tampering with forces better left untouched.\n\n\"The Design didn't account for this.\" Words uttered under Dairo's breath after the two of you had nearly been killed by an otherwise inconsequential mage. They didn't seem noteworthy when he spoke them, but as time went on you began to hear the term more and more. The Design. Precisely what The Design eludes you, but only those with great authority seemed to know of its existence. Hinting at its significance. Most speak of it with pragmatism, but others seem to revere it like religious doctrine.\n\nYou fixate on this hole in your understanding. These people who stole your life, who trained you in espionage and deception would grow to regret it. On missions you question prior to killing, scan research notes before burning, and ask leading questions. All signs point to a war over a singular concept. Fate. How this war is waged is not known to you, but it is clear you've been its soldier this entire time.¬†\n\nAnswers only breed more questions, widening the hole within. You wonder at the magnitude of this Design and grow paranoid of your famously discerning colleagues. Fortunately, no one seems to notice your inquisition.

You turned to face him, and if not for his presence as a Speaker, the small man would have seemed unremarkable. Instead, being alone with the mysterious academic felt like having a knife to your throat.\n\n\"Master Tserlbane,\" You replied steadily. While the arcanist was unnerving, his presence was familiar now. Manageable.\n\n\"Dairo has taught you well.\" He remarked, stepping closer. The compliment hadn't been a question, so it merited no response. \"Too well perhaps?\" He added. There was an implicit threat to his words. The implication causing the hairs on the back of your neck to stand on end.¬†\n\n\"Is that so?\" You responded flatly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he began, gazing about the pipeworks that ran along the length of the passage. \"Mages such as yourself are‚Ä¶ unique.\" Tserlbane considered, casually wiping a finger across the surface of one of the ancient pipes. Despite it being located in a remote, and unremarkable section of the colossal structure, it came back perfectly clean.\n\n\"What kind of mage is that?\"\n\n\"A weapon.\" He said simply, eyes returning to yours. Again, the statement hadn't been a question allowing you to maintain your silence. Tserlbane gave a small, ugly smile then inclined his head to the side. Gesturing for you to follow.\n\nThe two of you walked in silence as you were led down an unfamiliar, vacant set of turns ending in a lift. \"Expect pressure within your ears.\" He said with a gesture. Lifts, especially tall ones, weren't uncommon in the tower. Tserlbane followed behind, then waved his hand over a raised piece of metal affixed to the wall. You'd expected to be brought back to one of the many floors above, but to your surprise the platform began to descend with frightening speed.\n\n\"What is it you think we do here?\" He asked, unphased by the column of wall whizzing past as you ventured deeper and deeper below the city of Ryze.\n\nThe question, and Tserlbane's close proximity brought a surge of anxiety. You'd spent the last chapter of your time under him trying to secretly answer this very mystery. Even though you'd only been marginally successful, you still feared they'd catch on.¬†\n\n\"We? As in‚Ä¶ The University?\" you deflected. Mind still reeling for a better answer to his true question.\n\n\"Don't fret Mallory. You're not in any trouble.\" Tserlbane chuckled to himself, sensing your worry. \"By 'we' I mean those who follow The Designs. I know you're aware of these concepts, there's no need to hide it.\" He elaborated, tone more than slightly condescending.\n\nYou held his gaze for a long, considering moment. Eventually, you resigned yourself to whatever he had planned for this odd excursion. If he wanted you dead it was already too late. Besides, maybe you'd finally get some answers.\n\n\"Control.\" You finally responded. You knew the missions they sent you on typically revolved around divination, incana, and chronurgy. Threats to the university that presented as delves into magic that could manipulate information, fate, and time respectively. If not that, your missions were typically a component in some political scheme.\n\nTserlbane nodded, seeming pleased with the response. \"Very good. A simple, precise answer.\"\n\nYour inner ear began to swell from the pressure. \"How far down does this go?\" You asked, nervously changing the subject.\n\n\"Oh,\" Tserlbane laughed, \"all the way to the top!\" With that, the lift began to decelerate. His statement had obviously been a joke of some sort as the arch of a doorway rose from below. Stopping to align with the lift. \"Off you go.\" he said cheerfully.\n\nAnother hallway led to a grand, metallic door with a simple latchless handle. \"Do you know what they used to call Laenwalde before it was formed into its three kingdoms?\"\n\n\"The Badlands.\" You said absently, eyes tracing the imposing closed arch ahead.\n\n\"Yes. Untamable tribes, feudal lords, and generations of bloodshed. Do you know how they stopped it?\" He asked like any professor on the cusp of their point. You shook your head. In response, Tserlbane yanked the door open.\n\nA cool breeze pushed past you as the low pressure from the massive chamber ahead pulled what air it could from the hallway. Almost urging you forward. As you entered, glowing lines of light embedded in the circular metallic walls began to bleed dim illumination.\n\nThe shift revealed an enormous, alien chamber. Far larger than most buildings. Its floor was formed of three layered tiers, each lower than the last.¬† You'd entered onto the highest level through what seemed to be the room's sole exit. Just beyond lay a set of stairs, descending to the second, wider level. The lower platform housed what looked like a wide and perplexing array of panels and devices. All completely unfamiliar.\n\nHowever, these features were dwarfed by what lay in the room's center. The lowest level was the foundation to a towering effigy of a man, stretching far above even the highest tier of the chamber. Its body was formed entirely from metal pipeworks. A disorganized mess. They obviously hadn't been planned or engineered, in any sane manner. Nothing like the ones you'd been previously familiar with. They were haphazard. organic. A tangling mess like vines or tentacles that twisted and bunched to form a cohesive mass shaped like the elongated upper half of a person.\n\nIts appendages were wrong. The body didn't end in hands or legs for that matter. The pipes stretched down to the ground, fanning out in all directions. They covered the vast majority of the floorspace like overgrown plants. The sprawl blanketed the chamber, ascending the tiers and running up the room's high walls in an inefficient mess. They reached across the ceiling to venture up a wide, perfectly circular void in the chamber's roof. Disappearing into the darkness.\n\nYou took a few awed, involuntary strides into the enthralling, horrific chamber. Your echoing footsteps seemed the only sound at the bottom of the world. Atop the lumbering giant's shoulders was a twisted mass of pipe that formed a head tilted ever so slightly upward. Gazing¬† into the void above. It bore an out-of-place, jagged crown of tarnished gold. The relic seemed disturbing. Almost sickly. It stood out with an irregular glow against the chamber's din.\n\n\"W- what is it?\" You asked after what felt like an eternity.\n\n\"A synthetic god.\" Tserlbane said humorlessly. \"Your god.\"\n\nThe statement shook you from your stupor, and you shot a perplexed, almost offended look at the aged arcanist. His stoic expression affirmed his seriousness. You took another, closer look at the surreal being. Something seemed familiar about it. Not the sight itself but the vague outline. The face, or lack-there-of, was wrong to you. As if it were missing something you couldn't place.\n\nA million questions within your mind fought to be asked, but then it clicked. You knew exactly what this machine was shaped like. Its silhouette was at the center of all the world's controversy. The world's fear.\n\n\"Why is it shaped like Giriam?\" Your jaded resolve finally broke for the first time in years as you gazed upon the dead god's replica.\n\nTserlbane nodded with satisfaction. \"We don't know.\"","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.042234763Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Goliaths-Reflection":{"title":"Weaving - The Goliath's Reflection","content":"*Written by Luke Kell, Magnus' player*\n\nThe decision was made in an instant. To those around him, the moment passed as any other before. But to Magnus Steelhart, the choice bore the weight of his very soul. The young man stared at the reflection in the ornate bronze shield, once symbolizing everything he had ever dreamed of. Years of training, taking every bruise with pride knowing it would culminate in holding a shield such as this. A Ramshorn, protector of the North Honor, champion of the Stormfather‚Äôs glory. Even now, Magnus yearned to stand on the shores of the stonefields, ready to defend his people from the threat of Hoss. \n\nBut so much had happened since the day his mother, once all he aspired to be, handed him that Ram‚Äôs head aegis- and with it, the weight of the Ward‚Äôs expectation in him. The young man had seen so much more than his once na√Øve had ever imagined possible, and it showed in the reflection staring back at him. The fact was, he was no longer the boy forced from his home a short time ago. And as Magnus stared at the reflection‚Äôs convex edges, he saw much of the reasons why. \n\nFour other reflections looked back at Magnus, seven if you count their companions. They, and so many others have warped the reflection that he now saw into something he didn‚Äôt expect to see. Someone who had expectations far beyond the reaches of the stormwinds, expectations that could warp the very face of Zol as he knew it. \n\nSo, in that moment, the young man strapped the shield and all it represented to his back and gripped the titanic gleaming sword with both hands, allowing its radiant energy to resonate with his own crackling electricity. Because the fact was, Magnus Steelhart was no Ramshorn. He was a fucking Street Dog.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.043234768Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Hour-of-Shadows":{"title":"Weaving - The Hour of Shadows","content":"Silk sat still, crouched against the pale stones of the windswept grove. Everything always looked wrong to her during The Hour of Shadows. They called it an hour, but it was closer to 40 minutes for most of the year. She supposed that made sense. The Two-Thirds of One Hour of Shadows didn't have the same ring to it. It was a discomforting sliver of the night when [[The Moons]] were at their furthest point from one another. Sorrow in the north, Majesty in the West, and Luna in the East. The effect was a dull dream-like glow, and a trio of uneven shadows cast out from every object.\n\nSilk hated it. Made her anxious. Probably because it was the time when things went always wrong during stories told in taverns. Despite her dislike for it, she often found herself out during the uncanny hour. That was the life of a thief.\n\n\"Anxious thieves make the best thieves!\" Palce always said, but Palce was always saying things. In fact, his constant blabber was why she was out this evening. The burglary of a single relic in exchange for Palce's release. Easier said than done, especially since it was being transported by a VanVeld caravan.\n\nShe didn't know why people cared so much about relics from [[The Grand Nothing]]. Bits of distorted, illegible text, carved in old stone.¬†\n\nWhy would anyone want to know what happened to the old world? Obviously, their actions got them into a great deal of trouble. So much trouble the gods scratched away every bit of text they wrote‚Ä¶ Then again‚Ä¶ those relics were worth a lot.

Would his suffering never end? He'd endured the humiliation of being caught uninvited at the Beast's Ball, then he'd been forced to spend half a day suffering fools and scraping shit off of Gilligan's Lift, and now he'd be sore for the entire First Ring. Must all things come in threes? Bennet was beginning to realize what he was. An elven man of tremendous talent, high birth, and poor fortune. A tragic story indeed. If the world would just let him spread his wings, they would see how high he could fly. Why couldn't they recognize him for what he was? Bennet understood how his family could have missed it. At least now he could. Years spent vying for his father's approval had taught him that difficult lesson. Being the middle of seven sons, Bennet guessed his father didn't even know he'd been in Tenzentak for the last 6 years. It was no matter. His father was an important man with a busy schedule. Bennet couldn't fault him for that.\n\nIf anything he should be thanking his father. Even with a business empire to run, he had granted Bennet so many opportunities, like his first-ever job as an apprentice ship inspector. An important role within his family's shipwrighting enterprise. Bennet was still certain that it couldn't have been entirely his fault that a fleet of his father's newly sold vessels all experienced catastrophic sail failures. Besides, those sixty-some men were only stranded at sea for a week at most. It was all blown out of proportion. After that conundrum, his father was kind enough to get him a job with House Empress, working under the High Judge. Bennet thought he made a very good stenographer. However, his superiors quickly tired of his clever in-line-annotations. Apparently, there was no correct way to add things like \"sounded guilty\" or \"wasn't very convincing\" to scribed testimony. So ridiculous. Ah well, leave it to the justice system to be stuck in their old ways. After stenography, Bennet was reassigned to a reliable scribe's role in the tax department. A more foundational position. Despite having no appointed legislative power, Bennet somehow discovered a loophole where he accidentally exempted incoming ships from paying import tax for an entire week. He thought it was quite the discovery he had managed, but his manager was less enthused. That kerfuffle brought his time under the High Judge to a close.\n\nBennet's misfortune amongst House Empress was not a total loss. His wit had been recognized! The High Judge all but paid for him to be sent away to Kerketh Academy. Sponsored by his father, and his Zessgorni house, Bennet was sent packing to become an arcanist. He excelled in this of course. It took no time at all for his peers and even some of his teachers to become jealous of his natural talents. Bennet was such a rising star that a unanimous decision amongst his professors sent him away to the Kerketh Dispatchment of the Blade Hammer Guild. He had hoped to continue his formal education in Tenzentak. However, the guild's mages were more concerned with the practical application of magic, rather than lecture. But this was not all bad, for Bennet sought a palace to apply his newfound skills.\n\nHe was first assigned to work under an overrated master, with whom he argued endlessly. It was a short-lived arrangement, and the disagreements landed him amongst a party of adventuring peers. They were of his same rank, but those buffoons were hardly his equals. After they'd abandoned him inside a set of dangerous ruins, Bennet decided to forge his own path at the guild.¬†\n\nHe took any opportunity offered. If it suited him, of course. Bennet engaged in a litany of different practices. Adventuring, security, craftsmanship, construction, clerical work, tutoring, research, communications, and manual labor when things were slow. Bennet became a \"jack-of-all-trades\". Unfortunately, growing his resume came with an annoying cost. Bennet didn't know why, but his assignments often ended in scandal and burnt bridges. It wasn't Bennet's fault. His fellow guild members couldn't handle working with a savant! Few came from noble birth. Sadly, opportunities within the guild were growing thinner these days.¬†\n\nBennet stood and failed to work the soreness out of his muscles. This would be a problem today as his transgressions at the ball ended with him being unceremoniously removed from his job at The Hall Desk. He'd expected that. The guild wouldn't want a debonair nobleman's son who went against the grain to be the face of the guild. Bennet couldn't blame them. Frankly, he was counting on it. It was proving difficult to deal with a river of needy people every day. What he didn't expect was to be put on tournament construction duty. Bennet supposed it made sense. Someone had to put the arena back together after each fight, even though this kind of work was beneath him, a spot of charity wasn't. He would lend a hand where needed. With the missing 1-5 Potentium, the bulk of the meat-headed guild members who'd normally be on construction were likely on security duty. Ah well, at least this way he had good seats to watch the event, and wouldn't have to think about Old Abby's fools for a little while.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.043234768Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Warforged-Dream":{"title":"Weaving - The Warforged Dream","content":"*The introduction to the first chapter of the campaign. A dream shared amongst each of the members of the party witnessed during their last slumber before meeting each other. The main character of the narrative switches from one party member to another through out the weaving.*\n\n*Magnus*, you have been traveling a long time. You feel the ache of the road and a pit of hunger in your stomach. You cannot remember the last time you had a decent meal.\n\nIn fact, you cannot remember much. \"How the hell did you get here? Weren‚Äôt you just on a train?\" You wonder to yourself as your hand gains purchase on a stone, allowing you to pull yourself up onto the ridge of a hill. As you do, you feel the warmth of the full sun bathing you, illuminating your skin.\n\nAs you look out into the distance, you are shocked by what lies ahead. At the base of the hill, opposite the side you just climbed, lies a large circular valley, you realize you had just climbed the outermost part of an old crater.\n\n*Cyrus* gazes down at the unique geology of the landscape. Along the perimeter of the crater's inner circle are tall, ancient statues of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Three of which have been reduced to rubble. The method of destruction is no mystery to you, as you can see a large group of soldiers with ropes looped around the statue of [[Ayamot]].\n\nThe soldiers are distant and do not spot you as they strain against their ropes. You glance at the rubble left by their efforts. The ruined statue nearest to you bears a face you recognize: [[Giriam]], the supposedly dead god of agriculture and fertility.\n\nYou look to the other piles of rubble, but you do not recognize what's left of them. A quick count of the statues leaves you confused as you reach ten in total. 2 more than one would expect in the pantheon. You glance about for more answers, and something in the center of the crater catches your eye. It is reflective and bright. Your curiosity moves you more than anything else.\n\n*Sherman* descends the inner slope and begins crossing the distance to the object. As you make your way toward it, you can hear the voices of the distant soldiers.\n\nYou squint your eyes and finally make out the object. The remains of a [[Warforged]], its bottom half and left arm are missing entirely. Clutched within its remaining hand is an object you can't quite make out. You think the being to be dead until its head turns to look at you.\n\nIt bears no expression, as its metal face was not designed for emotion. However, you can feel its desperation, its fear of death.\n\nBefore you can act, the shouts of men and the thrumming of many distant, charging soldiers fill your ears. You look up to see thousands of people pouring over the sides of the crater. All running in a determined stride. Within mere moments, the terrain becomes a battlefield.\n\nThe soldiers from within the crater drop their ropes and draw their swords. You hesitate, trying to decide where to run. But you underestimate the rapid progression of the battle. However, the combatants pay you no mind.\n\nAll around you *Rozwald*, blood is shed. It is impossible to tell who is fighting who. You see the faces of many, you think you may even recognize some of them. Amongst their feet is the desperate [[Warforged]] in the center of it all.\n\nBefore you even realize what you are doing, you find yourself running for the injured automaton. Dodging and weaving the brawls around you.\n\nYou no longer feel in control of your own actions, as you become almost a spectator in your own mind, sharing in the Warforged's desperation. Whatever it holds within its hand grips your mind. It's strange gravity pulling you in.\n\n*Spade* closes in on it, your eyes locked in an understanding. Its fist outstretched to you, trying to pass off its burden.\n\nBut before you can reach it, a loud blaring fills your ears. A deafening sound of a horn that causes you to turn in panic.\n\nYou freeze in fear as the engine of a train barrels through the center of the battlefield, mere feet away from you.\n\n*Deimos* braces for impact, then simply opens his eyes.\n\nYou find yourself sitting on a bench in [[Rails]] Station. The red brick structure abuzz with people all around you. You realized that you had dozed off, but the dream‚Ä¶ it had felt so real.\n\nA short distance away, your train thrums with life. Its horn blares a final time, signaling that it is ready for boarding.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.043234768Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-The-Wrath-Wastes":{"title":"Weaving - The Wrath Wastes","content":"The elves called it Galfora. The changelings, Mak‚Äôsi'dahn. A place where the majesty of Yan Nalora met the twisted beauty that pours from the Lifewell. The Last Forest. A holy land where the planes of Invigorant, Immolation, Tempest, and Temperament were so close you could reach out and touch them. A place that is no more. The sole pass between The Blades and Myth‚Äôira. Trampled. Crushed by the many feet of soldiers and cursed by The King of Destruction himself.\n\nDuring the war of lies, the conflict that shaped the West, scores of troops had marched through the region. A path to kill The Reach. Genocide. On their soles, they brought pain and hatred for the Changelings. They sewed it into the ground like seeds for harvest. A corruption. But Galfora was old. Ancient. The pain of men was no match for its eternity. Their invasive seeds would not spread if left to grow on their own. Sadly, it was not the spreading of hate that posed a threat to the holy woods. It was its smell.\n\nThe scent of hate, of terror. It drew forth a predator so foul the stones still tremble at his name. Jaw, the Word of Wrath. A god. A being of undoing, and destruction. A singular man who made the threat of incoming soldiers as forgettable as insects on the breeze. No one knew what he wanted. No one knew why he killed. No one knew why his words made the mountains shake, and the sky weep.\n\nWhen they first saw him, it seemed a joke to the soldiers. The small group at the front of the formation mocked the orc who blocked their path. A madman, stranded in the woods far from home. An escaped slave perhaps? The humor was lost on them as they got closer. No one knows what words were shared in that early moment. All who heard were the first to die. However, none missed his following decree. A voice so loud it would shore stone from cliffs.\n\n\"Your choice has been made. Your lives, forfeit.\"\n\nTheir numbers were in the thousands, these soldiers. A force built to raze a city to ash. But eight simple words had changed them. An army no longer. Amongst the lush trees of Galfora stood an enormous crowd of scared, solitary men. The one in ten who survived said that following silence spanned long enough for even the bravest to reconsider their path. Then it began.\n\nJaw killed in droves. A harvest of wheat at the scythe's edge. Those who stood near him burst with the force of his movements. A boulder rolling down a hill, smashing through homes. His power was surreal. A thing from a dream. To witness the first tongue is to see the raw fray of the edgeless world itself. Terrible. Amazing. They were an army yes, but how does an army fight a god? Men fought, ran, froze, and died. They died like stars at dawn. Defenseless. Candles in the wind.\n\nWith every death, Jaw's wrath bled into the world. It took hold of the army‚Äôs hateful seeds and blossomed them into destruction. Galfora cringed and shook as Jaw crushed the army like ants. There is no record of how long it lasted. No count of how many were killed. Only in the weeks to come would they find what came of Galfora.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.043234768Z","tags":null},"/Weaving-Whine-Barrel":{"title":"Weaving - Whine Barrel","content":"*Note: this weaving is heavily inspired by The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch*\n\n\"Shame isn't it?

The cloud of sweet smelling smoke adding itself to the wharf nook's catalog of potent smells. \"Since when have you given two fucks about airships?\"\n\nKazen's beak clicked as he took a puff from his own pipe. \"Whaddya mean? I've always had a fascination with them.\"\n\nThe only discernible difference between the two Aaracockra was their clothes. Myer was still dressed like a simple airdock worker while Kazen only bore some affectations from his false constable's uniform. Having discarded most of it already.\n\n\"You've literally never remarked on a single airship. Not once.\"\n\n\"Maybe to you.\"\n\n\"We literally shared an egg, you dolt. You don't think that once in our thirty three years of life we'd have had a single conversation about the beauty of airships?\"\n\nKazen shrugged, taking another beakful of smoke.\n\n\"It is a nice ship though.\" Myer admitted. He and Kazen both nodding in agreement.\n\nThe sound of a wagon making its way down the quiet harbor took their attention. Kazen, being the active lookout, stood and pretended to stretch his wings in order to get a better look. Myer appeared not to notice the incomer, but placed a hand on the hilt of his pistol beneath his jacket.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" The portly human began \"would either of you happen to be Waldred?\"\n\n\"Indeed I would.\" Kazen gave casually. Waldred being one of the codenames they'd all chosen for today in case someone needed to discreetly pass a message.\n\n\"I was told if I delivered this here barrel of wine to a Waldred on Plank Row, and didn't ask any questions, I'd be paid a handsome eight silver doors.\"\n\n\"Well,\" mused Kazen, \"must be some wine then for such a pretty penny.\"\n\n\"Not sure,\" said the man as he hefted the barrel from the cart. \"Sure does swear a lot more than other wine though.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Kazen gave an understanding nod, \"well at the very least we'll use it for cooking. 8 silver you said.\"\n\n\"Yes, my good sir.\"\n\n\"Here's a full crown for forgetting about this whole ordeal.\"\n\n\"My,\" the man palmed his sweaty forehead, \"I seem to have wandered all the way to Windcliff!¬† Always seems to be the case for me on sunny days. Silly me!\"\n\n\"Good man.\" Kazen gave him a pat on the shoulder. Sending him on his way.\n\nMyer stood once the man departed. \"Y'know Kazen‚Äî I've been thinking‚Ä¶ while this windfall of wine has been mighty fortuitous, it's high time we give up our drinking! What say we dump this in The Narrow Sea as a show of willpower.\"\n\n\"Let me out already!\" Piped Zeke's youthful, muffled voice from within the cask.\n\n\"Y'know what brother. You're right!\" Kazen said, theatrically ignoring Zeke's pleas. \"Though, perhaps I could be persuaded into one final glass‚Ä¶ If there were a good story to drink to that is! Perhaps the story of how our newest member got himself shut into a barrel. Hm?\" Kazen casually placed the flat of his palm on the barrel. Leaning it to one side as he shifted his weight against it.\n\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Zeke groaned, \"gods damned patrols showed up the one second I went for a piss.

I just had to make a distraction to do it.\"\n\n\"Which was?\" The twins said in unison.\n\n\"Pulled one of the purple caps trousers down.\" Zeke said half guilty, half amused.\n\nThe twins gave a hearty laugh. \"Wait till Morza hears about this one! You're gonna be in so much shit.\" Chuckled Kazen.\n\n\"They chased me for a quarter hour! I used to hide at that wine trader's storehouse when I was little. He let me sleep in the sheds if kept him in loop with the quiet folk. Agreed to bring me here if you paid him 5 silver.\"\n\n\"Five?!\" Kazen kicked the barrel. \"He got ten!\"\n\n\"Ouch‚Äî that's not my fault.\" There were sounds of shifting from the barrel. \"Doesn't matter anyway. I got his purse.\" Zeke made the faint jingling of coins from within his wooden prison.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Myer made a wide gesture. \"Lets not concern ourselves with meager sums. Should everything go well we'll all be rich men and women come sunset.\n\nA distant boom shook the sky. The twins looked up to see the Halz Crodanza hurtling down towards the Narrow Sea in a ball of fire. No one spoke in the awed, slightly guilty moment that followed.\n\n\"Are we terrorists now?\" Zeke asked earnestly.\n\n\"*Nooo*,\" Myer started, \"Well‚Ä¶ sponsored by some. Maybe. The Septimus is a crazy bastard but he pays well.\"\n\n\"Plus Kaleen made sure there would be extra 'chutes on board. We're thieves, not murderers!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Nobility    | Social Class | The wealthy few of the city. There are only a handful of people within the city who are truly rich. These are typically mine owner, merchants, or those with political station. Their low abundance means that they mingle with the common folk frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The Vast majority. Farmers, craftspeople, dock workers, fishermen, miners, and things of the like. These people live relatively happy lives as the cost of living is low, and the citizens take care of their own. If someone is unable to provide for themselves they are usually looked after by the community, unless they are unlinked or intentionally drive people away.             |\n| Beggars     | Social Class | Those who are without means, and not looked after by the community. They may be addicts, sick, elderly or something of the like. Typically those who are not able to provide for themselves are looked after, but if they intentionally push away help or posses some trait that sparks fear or distrust, they will not receive the help that would be given if they conformed to society. |\n| Slaves      | Social Class | Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense. In [[Woogis]], slaves are only owned by nobility. They do not receive horrible mistreatment that many slaves do in larger cities. They are more in the category of servants forced into dedication by law. They still follow the regulations that are enforced upon slaves.                          |\n| Riff-raff   | Social Class | A term given to non-halfling individuals within the city. These may be troublesome visitors who are referred to by this name in a disdainful manner, or local born citizens who get called the title affectionately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Goods and Services\n\n| Name               | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Castle Brioleh     | Keep                 | The city's main keep                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Woogis Station     | Train Station        | The city's train station                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Woogis Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's main teleportation circle.

The name of this tavern is responsible for the name given to those not from [[Woogis]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by High Lady Pennilia Noktant. The city has a small garrison of enforcers who act as the defenders and law keepers. The garrison maintains is able to operate with a low head count due to the fact that very little needs enforcing within the city.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Laenwalde Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Woogis]] is not very significant. Its name in synonymous with rural, slow life. Some dream of emigrating to the city for its peaceful nature, and those who do find just that, but only that. The city region is lovely and serene, but does not have the resources many cities posses.\n\n## Historical Importance\nModern [[Woogis]] is actually the 3rd iteration of the city. Past conflicts have resulted in the city be razed as its defenses are greatly lacking. One would think that greater defenses would be build, but the attacks on the city were surprisingly low casualty as its inhabitants are historically skilled at fleeing. In response to this destruction, its people just picked up and moved down the coast to rebuild elsewhere. Some made motions to put in the effort to build major defenses, but the majority of citizens actually resisted it as it would 'spoil the views'. Near the city, ruins of older parts of [[Woogis]] are not hard to find.\n\nThe city is also famously the birthplace of [[King Tatelak II]]. A long time ago some estranged member of his bloodline emigrated to the peaceful city and was nearly forgotten about in the histories. Vigilant scholars followed the bloodline all the way down to the little costal town to discover the ruler.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- There are no airship ports in [[Woogis]]\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.045234778Z","tags":null},"/Wordbearer":{"title":"Wordbearer","content":"See [[Wordbearers]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.045234778Z","tags":null},"/Wordbearers":{"title":"Wordbearers","content":"See [[The First Tongue]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.045234778Z","tags":null},"/Wrath-Wastes":{"title":"Wrath Wastes","content":"See [[The Wrath Wastes]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.045234778Z","tags":null},"/Xerul":{"title":"Xerul","content":"*The City of the High Elves*\n![[Xerul 3.png]]\n\nThe elegant city of [[Xerul]] rests in the center of [[Gethsemane]].

Its citizens carry a deep love and respect for both their city, and territory. It is one of the many cities within [[Gethsemane]] that is very hard for outsiders to reach, as [[The Iron Tracks]] do not contain it within its routes. Because of this, [[Xerul]] is almost mythical to common folk of the other kingdoms.\n\n![[xerul v2.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Main Opportunity         | The city is comparable to a grand work of art, comprised over millennia by the many dedicated hands of [[Elves]]. A sort of utopia for its people. Everything has been designed and thought out to the greatest detail. Citizens spend their whole lives honing a single skill to a level of mastery that surpasses most anything seen across [[The Three Corners]]. Those who fit into the social structure of the city, have some of the highest quality-of-living in all of [[Zol]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Main Challenge           | To maintain such a perfect utopian city, many rules have to be implemented at every level. Religious regulations, cultural rules, and judicial laws are placed all throughout the city's society. Actual laws are enforced by the city's leadership, but the vast majority of restrictions placed upon an individual come from the general populace. One may face serious consequences if they are known for noisy disruptions, rude behavior, disrespect of nature, and things of the like. Citizens can exercise the Right of Zsar Daeum, a legal process where a group of 15 or more citizens can call a legal trial for poor behavior of another citizen. If found guilty, the punishment may involve things as light as a public apology, or as grave as banishment from the city. While this right is rarely exercised upon neighbors, its existence shapes the behavior of its citizens. However the law has special implications for outsiders, where the right can be exercised by as few as 3 citizens and usually has graver consequences. |\n| Climate                  | Temperate

Many commoners would see it as a place of pure myth, if it weren't for their historical influence.\n\nKnown for their export of extremely fine goods, powerful military, and xenophobia. \n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city is central to [[Gethsemane]]'s history, especially in terms of warfare. Its prominence in histories and stories makes it almost seem like the capital of [[Gethsemane]], however the region has no such station.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- [[Xerul]] is not fond of outsiders, but is especially cold to [[Humans]].\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.047234788Z","tags":null},"/Yanneran":{"title":"Yanneran","content":"*Zolaen God of Art and Wine, Major Deity*\n![[Yanneran.png]]\n\nKnown for their jovial and free spirited nature, [[Yanneran]] is the most liberal of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Yanneran has domain over the beauty drawn from the world, and the celebration of it.\n\n## Depiction\n[[Yanneran]] is depicted in three ways. One form taken appears as a large, portly, bearded man of olive skin and smiling face. Another depicts a beautiful of purple hair and fair skin that is sometimes covered in tattoos that shift and change constantly, commonly wearing ever-flowing robes of white.\n\nIn their most awestriking form, [[Yanneran]] appears as a gleaming spirit of purple and green light.

What little records were kept about it have been destroyed in the many civil battles that have occurred over the city's history. Some think it to be a few thousand years old, some think it is as old as [[The Awakening]], and then there are those who believe it predates [[The Undoing]] itself. No one understand the magical forces that keep city's ice unmoving and unchanging, or how it knows to dip beneath the surface during [[Greatwinds]], capable of trapping pockets of air in its major buildings to provide for its non-aquatic citizens.\n\nIt is a strange place of two rival worlds: the surface district of Shimmer, and its subaquatic counterpart, Cowl. While interconnected, these two sides of the city are very different. They are attached by deep pools located throughout the city that bore the whole way through the iceberg, bridging the two sides. In this odd civilization [[Triton]], [[Beastfolk]], [[Aarakocra]], and a cast of other various races live unharmoniously in its self-contained ecosystem.\n\n## Shimmer\n![[yoel_sundarum_-_shimmer.png]]\n\nShimmer is the city of Sun-Walkers, or as their underwater nieghbors like to call them: *Fe'tiir*. Which is the [[Triton]] word for 'those who can drown'. In the city's culture success is the only measure. Peoples judge each other on how well they perform in their chosen career or pursuit. How much money does a merchant make? How skilled is an artist? How well sculpted is ones furniture? How many people like their cooking? The list goes on and on. We see similar thought patterns in all cultures, but in Shimmer it is ten-fold. If one can prove themselves skilled, they will be invited to greater festivities, and given more opportunity. Its buildings are made of ice and stone, with the occasional timber accent.\n\n## Cowl\n![[yoel_sundarum_-_cowl.png]]\n\nThe under city of Cowl, known for its wild streets (although the district has no roads), and rowdy populace. Within Cowl, only the strong make their way. Those who live below the surface of [[The North Sea]], known as *Fathomers*, idealize strength and power. If you do not prove yourself as capable and strong, you may be looked down upon. Its buildings are formed entirely of ice, and most are filled with water. However a good deal of buildings are air-filled as they are used for things like drinking, cooking, or the usage of fine tools or fire that water would interfere with.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city is a unique place in [[Zol]], here one can find wisdom, knowledge, craftsmanship, food, and experiences like nowhere else within [[The Three Corners]]. It is a place of stories that seems so obscure many think it only exists in rumor. |\n| Main Challenge | The city is disconnected from the outside world, and it always has been. It has been living within a bubble and is completely unconcerned with what goes on outside. Within this bubble, it has developed a sort of city wide cabin-fever that can be felt all throughout its culture. Shimmer and Cowl do not get along as a whole, and it has come to blows in the past.|\n| Climate | Arctic |\n| Cuisine | Fish, sea-based vegetation, small portion of gathered vegetation from small nearby islands |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Medium |\n| Outer Villages| None |\n| City Leader | King Mandreg |\n| Primary Language(s) | Triton, Aarakocran, Common, Subaqueous Hand Signs |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | [[Triton]], [[Beastfolk]], [[Aarakocra]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | None |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Magical Iceberg City |\n| Architecture | Naturally accented ice and stone structures |\n| Color(s) | None |\n| Symbolism | None |\n| Defenses | The iceberg itself has an unknown enchantment.

They are a competitive bunch with one another and are known to idealize success. The economy of [[Yoel Sundarum]] does incorporate coin, but it is more focused on the general idea of bartering. This makes the idea of basing nobility on finance a moot point. So the people of Shimmer look at how well once succeeds in their career, or other pursuit. This informally determined status places one in the society of the upper city. |\n| Fathomers           | Local group | Those who reside in the underwater district of Cowl. Famed for their rowdy behavior, the people of Cowl idealize strength and capability. Those who are powerful, or favored by a powerful person are seen as the higher members of society. This power can be physical strength, or something more complicated like magical ability, or authority over a group of mercenaries.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Half Lunged         | Local group | Individuals who posses the means to both live in water and in air for extended periods of time.

Being a tavern it is filled with air to allow for drinking                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Authority\nWithin the city there is little formal law, but there is ruling power. Over the history of the city, the format of this rulership has gone through many forms. This is typically caused by some violent upheaval of the city, which someone uses to claim power. Sometimes Cowl and Shimmer have their own rulers and operate as different cities, sometimes there is a council of rulers, and sometimes (like the current ruler) there is a sole authority which both cities respect.\n\nThe current ruler is King Mandreg (a mononym), who is a Beastfolk man with a physiology similar to that of a walrus.  He originated from Shimmer, but was a powerful warrior in his youth. He was the leader for an unnamed band of mercenaries which he used to gain power during a period of unrest. His success as a leader gained him the respect of Shimmer, and his strength gave him the respect of Cowl. He has ruled over both cities for many years.\n\n### Laws\nThe city does not have formal laws, but there is an understanding of what can, and cannot be done. When crossing these lines in a public way, those with some form of authority usually bring the hammer down. \n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Yoel Sundarum]] is thought to be a place from stories. One third of the common folk believe it to be legend, one third argues for its existence, and the final third have never even heard of it. However it truly does exist. Its mechanisms of infrastructure maintained by the iceberg, and its strange socioeconomic climate baffle and intrigue travelling scholars who manage to find it floating out in [[The North Sea]].\n\nThe city is not hostile to outsiders, but one would not say they are friendly either. When arriving in [[Yoel Sundarum]], the locals will quickly size you up and determine how to treat you based on your actions.\n\n## Historical Importance\nThe city has no historical importance in the grand scheme of things. However in its own history, it is a place of unknown origin, that has faced many powershifts. It likely holds many secrets, but it is hard to parse them out from the already baffling city.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Most liquor within the city is comes from fermented seaweeds\n- Subaqueous Hand Signs are a wide cast of gestures used for non-verbal communication underwater. These hand signs are unique to [[Yoel Sundarum]].\n- Buildings in Cowl that are air-filled use a complex system of pipes, and cracks in the ice to ensure air can reach these structures.\n","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.054234824Z","tags":null},"/Yorn-et-Gaul":{"title":"Yorn et Gaul","content":"*The scarred city of Changelings*\n![[Yorn Et Gaul Skyline.png]]\n\n[[Yorn et Gaul]] was once the greatest city within [[The Glassius Reach]]. Famed for its adherence to [[The Pattern]], an extremely ordered way of living. The city was a bastion of the north. This sadly changed during the height of the [[Western War]] when the city was attacked and a relic called [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]], was lost. This object, central to the [[Changelings]] culture, has never been recovered. Most believe it was destroyed, but some think it was stolen by invading forces. Regardless, its absence has damaged the city's order and culture greatly. The city is now upon hard times, and has been for around half a centaury. Despite losing [[The Apex]], the people of [[Yorn et Gaul]] continue to revere the site where it was once held, attempting to maintain their ordered beliefs and society. However the empty pedestal that once held [[The Apex]] does not provide the grounds required for such a complex belief system. Regardless, it is still desperately worshiped by the city's people.\n\nNow, the city is experiencing growing disorder and even crime. [[Changelings]] of [[Yorn et Gaul]] are beginning to lay down their old traditions. [[The Pattern]] has now become too cumbersome for many, and they are choosing to lead lives unguided by the many rules of their ancestors beliefs. The city's authority has attempted to rebalance things with little success.\n\nOn the opposite end of things, the fanatical members of society have begun to lash out in different ways. Some claim [[The Apex]]'s absence to be a test, and worship even more than the Changelings have done traditionally. Others strike out at those who deviate from the ways of old. Many groups have been formed to try and locate [[The Apex]], based on the idea that it was stolen.\n\n![[yorn_et_gaul.png]]\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | The city is an open wound on the world. While tragic, it gives a direct view into the heart of such a unique people and culture. Witnessing the daily life of [[Yorn et Gaul]] is like looking through geological layers of history all the way back to [[The Awakening]], and possibly even before. The [[Changelings]] have such a long standing, well documented history of their people. It begins when the [[Changelings]] found themselves in possession of [[The Oldshards]] after [[The Awakening]]. Bearing no knowledge of their past, they possessed a strange reverence and innate understanding of the relics, despite their lack of memories. All their traditions were built around them, and the removal of [[The Apex]] exposes the nature of [[Zol]] and its people in a very tangible way. It is also a place where [[Changelings]] can live unencumbered by an old religion, however they cannot do so without judgement. |\n| Main Challenge | It is no secret that [[Yorn et Gaul]] struggles. Those who don't leave the city either cling to echoes of a fading past, or stray from their traditions into the bleak unknown. Disorder plagues its days, and there does not seem to be an end in sight. Many outsiders frequently ask why those who seek to maintain their traditions don't emigrate to [[Corinth]]. Some do, but in Changeling culture, the oldshard one is born near is thought to play a distinct role in ones life. They believe that the oldshard they are not attuned with cannot connect with them. |\n| Climate | Continental |\n| Cuisine | Exotic farmed goods, fish, exotic spices |\n| Export | None |\n| Size | Large |\n| Outer Villages| Some |\n| City Leader | Yemodhan Surrite |\n| Primary Language(s) | Changeling |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | [[Changelings]] |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Exaltation Obscura of [[The Oldshards]] |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, River valley/Hilltop |\n| Architecture | Sleek obsidian brick, sharp features, tall buildings, elongated and thin detail-work |\n| Color(s) | Yellow, Black and Red |\n| Symbolism | A tall and narrow trapezoid with the wide part on top (The symbol of [[The Vertex]]) |\n| Defenses | Remote, hostile terrain, army of [[Changelings]] highly skilled in covert and deceptive warfare, High walls, allies with [[The Word of Wrath]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group                     | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Shardwitnesses            | Religious/Political Station | Those elected to lead the city, and bear witness to the guidance of [[The Apex]].

Shardwitnesses are similar in their influence to foreign nobility, but lead very strict and humble lifestyles. Those who become Shardwitnesses must be nominated many people (peers, mentors, and authorities) and also prove themselves by means of written essay, and engagement in political and philosophical debate.                                                                                             |\n| The Public                | General populace            | The people of the city are faced with great social and political struggles. The systems established by [[The Pattern]] originally created much infrastructure for [[Changelings]] of all kinds, but with the loss of [[The Apex]] the people are divided. Some cling to what once was, others deviate into new ways of living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Members of [[The Eelynn]] | Academic Station            | Scholars and philosophers tasked with teaching and understanding the world. Specifically through the lens of [[The Oldshards]]. Members of this school pursue careers in magic, scholarship, and teaching. All people of the city from ages 8-15 participate in learning at [[The Eelynn]]. The school provides many levels of education, and is a repository of some of [[Zol]]'s most obscure knowledge due to its influences, and removal from the rest of the world. Some members of [[The Eelynn]] are rumored to be tasked with making long pilgrimages to distant lands, bearing changeling disguise, to return with knowledge not yet possessed by [[The Eelynn]]. The highest ranking members of [[The Eelynn]] are all Shardwitnesses.

These members go on to study magic, philosophy, and various other branches of academia. All of this study is viewed through the lens of [[The Oldshards]], and the worlds relationship to them. [[Yorn et Gaul]]'s branch of [[The Eelynn]] faces great challenges without [[The Apex]].                                                                      |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overlooked by Shard Witness Yemodhan Surrite. Surrite is commonly mocked as one of *The Unwitnessed*, a term used for rulers of [[Yorn et Gaul]] since the [[Western War]] and the loss of [[The Apex]]. Despite the city turmoil, Shard Witness Surrite has had a reasonable amount of success compared to their predecessors. They have a reputation for firm rule which has forced criminal activity deep into the shadows.\n\nAlong with Shard Witness Surrite, the Head Tarsect Lawrence Lostara is a very prevalent authority within the city. They are know as the Shard Witness' attack dog who cracks down on deviant behavior. The Head Tarsect is hated by many.  \n\nBeyond that the city's military is formidable, as defense is a large concern for the city since the [[Western War]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Glassian Laws]], however enforcement is an issue within the city for minor crimes.\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, [[Yorn et Gaul]] does not have much influence outside of its territory. It has the lesser economy within The Reach, and as a result does not export much. However within history and rumor it is a place of frequent mention. Some talk about the hardships it faces, while others talk about it as a hive of evil where the good kingdoms of the west prevailed.\n\n## Historical Importance\nOnce the greatest kingdom of The Reach, [[Yorn et Gaul]] is now mostly known for its great losses sustained during the [[Western War]].\n\n*For more information on this, see the following section 'Destruction of Yorn Et Gaul'*\n\n## Destruction of Yorn Et Gaul\nDuring the late [[First Age]], [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] faced a great deal of political infighting. Some evidence of this pointed to the interference of [[Changelings]]. [[Laenwalde]] and [[Gethsemane]] began proffering threats towards [[The Glassius Reach]]. [[The Glassius Reach]] denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would be called the [[Western War]].\n\nThe [[Changelings]] were outnumbered greatly, but they proved a very difficult foe due to their strange environment, and the fact that they can manifest in any physical, humanoid form.\n\nThe clashing of kingdoms stretched on for just over one hundred years, before the attackers were able to lay siege on [[Yorn et Gaul]]. The destruction was swift and brutal once the gate fell. Many changelings adopted disguising forms and fled the city. \n\nOnce the dust settled it was realized that [[The Apex]], one of [[The Oldshards]], was destroyed (however some think that it was stolen). At this time, it was seeming like [[The Glassius Reach]] would soon be conquered. This changed when a [[Wordbearer]] of unknown origin entered the fray.\n\nEhmalog, Word of Wrath came to the aid of [[The Glassius Reach]]. It is not known why he did this, nor where he came from. The [[Wordbearer]]'s capacity for killing was like no other. He single-handedly slaughtered the invaders armies in droves. Even Faraday, Word of Armaments could not defeat him.\n\nThe invaders armies were forced to withdraw. [[Yorn et Gaul]] was retaken by [[Changelings]]. However the city's wound, its loss of [[The Apex]], would never heal.\n\nEven to this day Ehmalog, Word of Wrath, is said to stalk the mountain pass in a tract of land called the [[Wrath Wastes]]. He kills those he deems trespassers of [[The Glassius Reach]]. None know why he does this for the [[Changelings]], but without his aid they would have surely fallen.\n\n*For more lore read [[Weaving - The Wrath Wastes]]*\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The city is the nearest of all to [[Holyfield]], and as a result has much folklore about it. This includes things like strange people called 'Nots' who come to the city and steal away children and bring them to [[Holyfield]]. Others think the place where spirits go until they are reborn. Regardless it is avoided by most.\n- The city does utilize [[Apparatum]], however its disconnection from the outside world has made it difficult for [[The Glassius Reach]] to keep up with the advancements in technique and skills involved in the [[Artificers]] practice.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.055234829Z","tags":null},"/Zelatt":{"title":"Zelatt","content":"see [[Zelatt, The Draconic Amalgam]].","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.062234865Z","tags":null},"/Zelatt-The-Draconic-Amalgam":{"title":"Zelatt, The Draconic Amalgam","content":"*Void God of Chaos, Major Deity*\n![[Zelatt.png]]\n\nA hauntingly beautiful force of chaos.

While true by some definitions, [[Zephyrean]] belief is one of the larges religious denominations that is not a Zolaen-Centric, or Trinity-Centric belief system. It is based in worship of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]] and the [[Greatwinds]] of the north-eastern kingdom of [[The Ward]].\n\n[[Zephyrean]] belief focuses on the idea that there are great dangers within [[Zol]]. Only through strength, honor, and unity can they be overcome. You can only grow through challenge.\n\nThe [[Zephyrean]] religion formed largely in isolation, making its lore and traditions quite different from the dominant religions of [[The Three Corners]] like [[Arkian]] belief or [[Trinaism]].\n\n## Values\n- [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]\n- [[Greatwinds]]\n- [[The Ward]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n- Strength\n- Honor\n- Community\n- Unity\n- Willpower\n- Struggle\n- Dragon Slaying\n- [[The Enduring]]\n- [[The North Honor]]\n- [[Archon]]s\n- The [[Ferric Alphabet]]\n- [[Stormcallers]]\n- Warriors\n\n## Relevant Gods and Forces of Zol\n- [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]\n\n## Scripture Outline\n### Creation Belief\n[[Zephyrean]] scripture describes the [[Sea of Monsters]] as a world of endless, angry wind. An infinite sky filled with horrible monsters. [[Adrathar]] came and stilled this sky. He fought along side the other warrior [[Gods]] like [[The Watcher]] and his pantheon of [[Zolaen Gods]] against the darkness of the early world. In their victory, they founded [[Zol]].\n\n### Ancient Society\n[[Zephyrean]] scripture describes the old world as something vast, beautiful, and strange. The great warriors of old fought of every beast and enemy the [[Gods]] had. They lived in peace for many ages. Then a great, unnamed darkness came. It was so terrible that it tore the world into pieces. The people of the old world had been living in peace for so long they forgot how to fight. Only [[Adrathar]]'s people remembered the warrior's ways. Though their strength wasn't enough. This weakness cost [[Zol]] everything.\n\n### The Undoing\n[[Zephyrean]] lore tells of a horrible war against a strange and ancient darkness, it drove the [[Gods]] apart. [[The Watcher]] and his [[Zolaen Gods]] decided to burn the old world down, and build it anew to drive away the darkness. [[The Undoing]]. [[Adrathar]] did not condone [[The Watcher]]'s actions, but he did not condemn him. However, this drove a wedge between the two gods.\n\n## Church Structure\nThe [[Zephyrean]] church has a very important role in [[The Ward]]'s culture. Church's do not have an interconnected hierarchy amongst them. They are instead usually organized by their local region. Each town, neighborhood, or district having its own church.\n\nChurches are ran by an **Aeostraemos**, a position similar to a high priest. Sometimes the title is shortened to **Aeo**. Beneath them may have a few various **Priests** aiding them in the organization of their church.\n\n## Followers\n### Modernist\nModernist belief surrounds the idea of honor, and doing what is best for one's self, and their community. Many with swear an oath that they live by. Some are simple, like swearing to be a skilled, and fair tradesman to their community. Others may be more complex and personal.\n\n### Fundamentalist\nFundamentalist belief is focused on the idea of extreme dedication, struggle, and self sacrifice. Fundamentalist Zephyreans are known to subscribe very literally to the ideals of [[Zephyrean]] scripture. They are most often known for idealizing strength, and acting as a warrior.\n\n## Geographically Significant Regions\n- [[The Ward]]\n\n## Other Information\n- [[Hoss]] is known for its tendency to lean towards fundamentalist ideals.\n- [[Zephyrean]] belief sees the [[Ferric Alphabet]] as a sacred thing. Its symbols are used for spiritual and ceremonial purpose. Because of this, [[Zephyrean]] religion does not allow for the usage of [[Iron Light]]. [[Apparatum]] and [[Warforged]] are seen as heretical.\n\n## Churches/Temples of Note\n- The Church of the Winds. Organized in [[Often]] and [[Fike]]\n- The Glass Cathedral, of [[Hoss]]","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.06323487Z","tags":null},"/Zessgorn":{"title":"Zessgorn","content":"*Costal beauty*\n![[zessgorn 3.png]]\n\nZessgorn, the City of Cups. Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and once known as the Tarot City. Zessgorn's social hierarchy is defined by [[The Rings of Tarot]] and by extension [[Zessgorn Cups]]. It is a complex structure to an outsider, but simple in practice.\n\n![[zessgorn.png]]\n\nZessgorn's founding was largely influence by a mystic tradition called [[The Tarot]].  They would put their faith in the concept of fate, drawing from sacred decks called [[Tarot Cards]]. The leaders of cultural groups within [[Zessgorn]] were known for attempting to read the fates via these cards to determine the best path for their people. \n\n![[zessgorn 1.png]]\n\nA set of rings were forged to represent the cards held within the Tarot Tradition, [[The Rings of Tarot]]. The bearers of these rings were meant to act as leaders and protectors of Zessgorn, as avatars of the fates. In recent history they have become a scarce resource people will do dark things for.\n\nZessgorn is a beautiful costal city, it is known for its plethora of colorful tapestries that are strewn all about its city, gorgeous beaches, and [[Skytrack]] that carries passengers from the lower city to the keep.\n\n## Zessgorn's Strange Culture\n[[Zessgorn]] is known for its odd customs. Mainly for its rules regarding [[Zessgorn Cups]]. The people of the city all carry tankards with bottoms marked with [[Ferric Alphabet]] signets to designate their house, social standing, and who's protection they are under.\n\n![[zessgorn 2.png]]\n\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | While governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] on paper, the city follows ancient traditions regarding [[The Rings of Tarot]]. This makes for a city of with multiple people of high, competitive authority given by their possessed ring. People pay allegiance to these [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] in exchange for membership amongst their house. This includes benefits like social status, food, housing, protection, careers, and community. |\n| Main Challenge | The city once operated in a balance of powers for many years after the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. This was until [[The Paige of Cups]] discovered a secret to her ring that gave her power far beyond that of her peers. This imbalance sparked disorder and chaos in [[Zessgorn]]. Now the city faces rivalry between houses, crime, and general disorder as [[The Paige of Cups]] has essentially taken over as the city's ruler. |\n| Climate | Tropical |\n| Cuisine | Fish, fresh fruits, cheeses, olive oil, spiced bread, and wine |\n| Export | Wine, Fruit, Fish, Textiles, Salt |\n| Size | Large |\n| Outer Villages| Many |\n| City Leader | Lord Esartes Hald |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, vibrant, and the city's [[Skytrack]] |\n| Architecture | Cycladic, Fabric Canopies |\n| Color(s) | Gold, Maroon and Silver |\n| Symbolism | A ring with an ocean wave in the center |\n| Defenses | Large naval fleet, City garrison, House forces, [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] |\n\n## People Groups\n\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| House Empress | Tarot House | The house of the [[Alderian Seat]] (the bearer of The Empress Ring of Tarot). This house contains only nobility, conducts their business very formally and by the books. Joining this house is no mere task of simple payment. One must be invited. This house also contains The Ring of Judgement, who's bearer conducts the court of law. Many argue it is the most powerful house in [[Zessgorn]] currently. This house is denoted by the [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for City. |\n| House Cups | Tarot House | The wealthiest and second largest house of [[Zessgorn]]. Headed by [[The Paige of Cups]], this house contains people of all social classes. It is the most arguably the most powerful of the houses and has a reputation for criminal operations. Many view this as the city's true governing power. This house is denoted by the [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for Wine. |\n| House Temperance | Tarot House | The means of production. This house is headed by The bearer of The Temperance Ring of Tarot this house owns the city's dock and is largely made up of working class individuals. This house controls the cities exports. This house is denoted by the [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for Water. |\n| House Hermitage | Tarot House | The house of the common folk. This house was formed in opposition to the need to join a Tarot House to achieve protection. Led by the bearer of The Hermit Ring of Tarot, this house is made up of the common folk as the house's taxes are by far the smallest. It is a passive house compared to its peers, but largest in numbers. This house is denoted by the [[Ferric Alphabet]] symbol for Location. |\n| Herald Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Herald Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people are of the highest standing in [[Zessgorn]]. |\n| Empowering Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Empowering Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]].

Most of which act as lieutenants for their respective houses, save for The Hermit who heads their own house. |\n| Lesser Ring Bearers | Misc. | A defunct group of individuals who possessed one of the Lesser Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people were of common standing in [[Zessgorn]].

Each has their own set of similar services. One can only shop at the market associated with their house membership. Each market reflects the general state of their house well. The Empress Market is neat and high class, the Cups Market is a chaotic bazaar, the Temperance Market is a utilitarian hub of trade, and the Hermitage Market is a humble square of shops. Magical items are difficult to find here as most are typically retained by a house for their power; magic items that are available are typically functional [[Apparatum]]. |\n | The Full Cup | Tavern | A massive tavern, central to a small complex of buildings that act as the headquarters for House Cups.

This individual is responsibly for relations with the rest of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and protection of the city.\n\nIn reality, the city is now know governed by its four houses:\n- House Empress\n\t- Headed by Lord Esartes Hald\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Empress Ring** - Lord Esartes Hald, a middle aged gnome man\n\t\t- **Judgment Ring** - High Judge Relkar Treddin, an Old conservative dwarven man\n\t\t- **Justice Ring** - Inquisitor Gharn Vendur, a brutal and well trained goliath man. Father to Eldora Vendur\n\t\t- **The Tower Ring** - Lord Captain Eldora Vendur, a fiercely loyal goliath woman. Daughter to Gharn Vendur.\n- House Hermitage\n\t- Headed by The Hermit, aka Thorin Black\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Hermit Ring** - Thorin Black, an old and wise human man\n\t\t- **Death Ring** - Grudge, a massive orc man of few words. A long time friend to The Hermit\n- House Temperance\n\t- Headed by Lady Temperance, aka Yelna Fennik\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Temperance Ring** - Yelna Fennik, an old dragonborn woman of great intelligence\n\t\t- **Chariot Ring** - Hjen Valut, a clever tabaxi woman\n\t\t- **Wheel of Fortune Ring** - Marcus Wanderer, a half-elven, well-mannered man who choses his words carefully, and plays his cards wisely. Brother to Calanir Wanderer\n- House Cups\n\t- Headed by [[The Paige of Cups]], aka [[Rali Trunsarr]].\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Paige of Cups Ring** - [[Rali Trunsarr]], an elven woman appearing of middle age\n\t\t\t- All known lesser rings\n\t\t- **The Fool Ring** - Calanir Wanderer, a mischievous and slippery human man of extremely quick wit. He constantly gets himself into trouble while simultaneously manipulating all around him. Brother to Marcus Wanderer and seemingly the romantic partner of [[The Paige of Cups]].\n\t\t- **The Sun Ring** - A man who simply goes by the name of 'The Sun'. No one knows their origin. They are mute, and fiercely loyal to [[The Paige of Cups]].\n\n## Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Zessgorn]] is known to be a problematic city when compared to the other free cities. This is because of the disorganized authority within the city. The [[Alderian Seat]]s of the kingdom constantly pressure Lord Esartes Hald to strike order within his city, as [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] depend on very specific political policies to maintain freedom and justice. [[Zessgorn]]'s reliance on rings damages this balance.\n\n## Historical Importance\nDuring major historical events like [[The Dragon War]], the [[Beast Ire]] plague, and [[The Illithid Invasion]], Tarot power ring bearers fought as crucial warriors of eastern [[Zol]].\n\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Being within the city, and/or being without house membership is known as being *Cupless*. Cupless individuals have a very difficult time finding places to stay, shop, or eat. These individuals are also typically preyed upon by petty criminals.\n- House membership is typically acquired by paying taxes to one of the houses, or giving some great gift or service to it.\n\t- One can also purchase temporary membership if they are visiting the city.\n- The city's dock is also a hub of pirate trade, but is done covertly to avoid prosecution.\n\t- Whole ships and their crew who trade here are all associated under the captain's cup. There is a small organization on [[The Isles of Al'Kehtal]] that coordinates this relationship.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.074234925Z","tags":null},"/Zessgorn-Cups":{"title":"Zessgorn Cups","content":"Zessgorn Cups are a social tool utilized in the city of [[Zessgorn]] to determine someone's status and house membership in the cities complex socioeconomic structure. Said structure is largely determined by the remaining [[The Rings of Tarot]], and their respective houses. These rings give both magical power and social status.\n\nAll who enter Zessgorn must fit into the hierarchy of the city. Each person must carry a cup with them, with the symbol of the Ring Bearer they pay tribute to for protection and services.\n\nEach cup is unique, and given by a ring bearer themselves. If a ring bearer would die, their patrons would go to their successor.\n\n## Origin of Zessgorn's Cups\nBefore [[The Paige of Cups]] came to power, [[Zessgorn]] had sat in a state of careful balance since the end of [[The Dragon War]]. Even the [[Alderian Rebellion]] did little to disrupt its long standing traditions.\n\nThe city operated by relying on the rule of those who bore the Empress and Emperor rings. These rulers, along with the other Herald Ring Bearers oversaw the city. They kept order by the aid of the Empowered Ring Bearers. As generations progressed, rings were passed to chosen successors.\n\nThe Lesser Rings were scattered amongst the common population to ensure the people of the city would never be without their own agency to push back against the ruling powers if they ever abused their own rings.\n\nIt was thought that [[The Paige of Cups]] ring had a simple power, it allowed an individual to [[Attunement]] with an above average amount of magical objects. Most people's [[Vizir]] allows them attune to around 3, but the ring added capacity for one or two more.\n\nThis changed when [[Rali Trunsarr]] discovered that [[The Paige of Cups]] ring allowed her to attune to any number of the lesser rings, she enacted a plan to take the city for herself. She fought, stole, and bought all the lesser rings she could. This granted her strength, skill, luck, and magical powers. The lesser rings, while relatively unremarkable on their own compared to the Empowering rings, had a multiplicative effect. Rali's own personal power rose almost to that of a [[Wordbearer]].\n\nThis sudden change to the power structure sparked civil war and riots within the city. [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] turned on one another as people tried to seize power or return order. The people of [[Zessgorn]] soon discovered that if one of the [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] kills one of their peers, it destroys the ring of the victim. This only increased tensions. Many rings were destroyed by assassinations or lost by the hands of fleeing [[Tarot Ring Bearers]].\n\nIn the end, the remaining major powers were The Empress Ring Bearer, The Judgement Ring Bearer, The Temperance Ring Bearer, and [[The Paige of Cups]]. The bearers of these rings formed three distinct factions of power that settled an agreement to cease the city's fighting. Much tension stayed between these factions despite the agreement. No group played their hand and a divide was formed.\n\nThe common people started joining with these factions, going by the name of 'houses'. All but one of the remaining bearers of the Empowering Rings joined houses as high ranking members. The Hermit Ring Bearer was the sole outlier, they instead united the lowest class of citizens into a house of their own.\n\nIdentification between houses became important as tensions rose. Colors and garments were first used to display one's house membership but they became instrumental for espionage. The House of Cups was the first to implement a true solution to this. [[The Paige of Cups]] employed [[Artificers]] to embed [[Ferric Alphabet]] Signets into the bottom of tankards. These allowed for her house to verify identity, membership, and status using magic. Important records, and documentation are created by the special offices amongst the House to audit this information.\n\nThis worked so well for House Cups, that House Hermitage and House Temperance implemented the same strategy. Both for its efficiency and to appeal to [[The Paige of Cups]]. Eventually the majority of the city was using this method to conduct business and daily life, so House Empress followed reluctantly.\n\nIn modern day, the houses follow the tradition of succession, save for [[The Paige of Cups]] who is immortal by the rules of the mortal coil. In modern day, even the lowliest citizens have their own cup.","lastmodified":"2025-09-07T14:24:02.074234925Z","tags":null},"/Zezan-Bard-College":{"title":"Zezan Bard College","content":"A wild and eclectic school of The Arts, and even a little [[Magic]].
