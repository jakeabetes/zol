Most of the kingdoms resources were allocated to the coast of [[The Narrow Sea]] defending its borders against [[Gethsemane]].\n\nThis left South Kapesh without much of its normal defenses. Distant from the conflicts in the north east, a young [[Half-Orc]] man named [[Eirmond the Brave]]. Son of a prostitute, Eirmond was forced to watch the mistreatment of his mother and many others his whole life. When his mother was killed by an enraged human customer, he decided to begin a rebellion of his own.\n\n[[Eirmond the Brave]] and many other [[Off-Human]] slaves, primarily [[Orcs]], took [[Ka'thoor]] with great bloodshed. Despite the losses, it was the first time rebels had taken a city in [[Kapesh]]. Rumors spread quickly, and another rebellion was sparked in [[Hanen]]. After much fighting, and aid from rebels in [[Ka'thoor]], [[Hanen]] was taken as well.\n\nHuman nobility were executed, and the lower human population would likely have been as well, if not for Eirmond's mercy. These individuals were given a choice, aid the rebellion or face exile. Many resisted and some chose exile, but a sizeable group decided to stay and fight alongside rebels.\n\n[[Deepspell]] was the next strategic foothold to take, it was a difficult city to seize, especially with the aid of [[Kerketh Academy]] and their mages. It is likely the city never would have fallen, if not for a group of open minded students led by Alex Laro-Rissan, a charismatic noblemen's son who began a movement to stop the mages of the academy from fighting the rebels. Some say it was an act of honor, while others believe it was done in defiance of his parentage. Eventually it broke out into infighting within the academy. Ultimately rebels prevailed and the border between north and south [[Kapesh]] was secured.\n\nIt was at this time, the city of [[Holocene]] surrendered without prompt. The city and their nobles were kept safe and it became one of the rebels cities. This annexed the southern half of the region off from north [[Kapesh]].\n\n[[Rails]] and [[Zessgorn]] were taken soon after. [[Zessgorn]] notably by a group of slaves already within the city. This only left [[Tenzentak]]. Unfortunately, this was when [[Kapesh]] began making headway with their counter-attack. [[Ka'thoor]] was retaken, and the human forces then moved on to [[Hanen]].\n\nRemarkably, [[Hanen]] held out against 3 major attacks by [[Kapesh]] with no support, and almost no resources. This one in a million chance forced [[Kapesh]] to retreat to [[Ka'thoor]]. They were ambushed by the forces of [[Holocene]] during this retreat, and [[Hanen]] was secured once again.\n\nThe rebels eventually retook [[Ka'thoor]], and all attention was turned on [[Tenzentak]]. The city's rough outskirts and defensible position made it for a long drawn out battle. It wasn't until a well trained group of [[Tabaxi]] rebels scaled the cliffs edge in great numbers and broke the outer walls defensed from the inside. In this victory the rebels took south [[Kapesh]] in its entirety. \n\n## The Founding of The Free Cities of Alderun\nAfter [[Tenzentak]] was taken by rebels, [[Kapesh]] attempted to retake [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Deepspell]], but were unsuccessful. The region was in a state of chaos, but had a hopeful air to it.\n\nEirmond and representatives from the cities met in [[Rails]] to establish a new government. The [[Alderian Council]] was formed for this purpose. A group of representatives, one from each of the cities, to serve the purpose of maintaining each city, and upholding the laws and values. The region was renamed [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Alderun meaning *hope* in [[Orcish]].\n\n[[Kapesh]] did not recognize them as a kingdom for many years, but eventually caved to political and military pressures.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.61790943Z","tags":null},"/Amplidation":{"title":"","content":"# Amplidation\n[[Amplidation]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]].

Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city outskirts.\n\nEventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name [[Bloodhunters]], and the hunted were called [[Beastmen]]. Their affliction was dubbed as [[Beast Ire]].\n\nThe beasts were extremely powerful and mad, they took warriors of equal strength to kill them. Many warriors began consuming the blood of the slain [[Beastmen]] in small doses to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of [[Beast Ire]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] sought to stop the affliction but it had taken on a life of its own, tainted by greed and the conflict between mortals and [[Beastmen]].

Others only fell for a time like [[Little Triumph]], [[Zessgorn]] or [[Reach Run]]\n\n## Resolution\nOne day the contagious nature of the disease stopped entirely.

The affliction would be transferred into [[Kerndall]]'s body, and the spread would cease. [[Kerndall]] would then become the servant of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\n[[Kerndall]] was maddened by the affliction and was dubbed [[Kerndall, the Feral King]]. His son [[Ralatas, Prince of Beasts]] took his throne. Slowly, [[Zol]] began to return to normalcy.\n\nSome of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed. They hid in remote locations.

His behavior may turn on a dime between generous or demanding.\n\nFollowers of Cadence claim that is is done to *challenge* mortals. it is thought that putting the world in a place where unexpected, but great things can occur sews seeds for Adaptability.\n\n## Worshipers\nCadence's followers are known to be erratic, but endearing. They follow his example, and never let the world predict their next move. They set about the [[Zol]], ever-chaotic, looking to find the most unexpected ways they can serve the greater good.\n\nSome call these folk *Yes-men* and they are known to do random acts like leaving a baked pie on someone's doorstep, or completing unfinished construction projects overnight. Once a group of Yes-Men in [[Arcadia]] shredded every ledger of tax collector in broad daylight, then turned themselves in to law enforcement.\n\nYes-Men organize themselves in regular secret meetings called *The Determining* where goals are set foreword and decided upon by the Yes-Men. These set goals may involve small local projects or large pilgrimages.\n\nYes-Men are proselytizers, always sharing the word of Cadence in the most unexpected manner. Skeptics see them as ne'er-do-wells seeking to disrupt the balance of their preferred systems, while others think they are kind hearted oddities who bring good luck wherever they go.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.62590946Z","tags":null},"/Caster":{"title":"","content":"An individual who uses [[Magic]], usually via a [[Spell]].\n\n![[Caster Diagram.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.629909475Z","tags":null},"/Chronomancy":{"title":"","content":"# Chronomancy\n[[Chronomancy]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is extremely rare. It is magic that involves the manipulation of ones location on the 4th dimensional plane of [[Nodes]], allowing the manipulation of time.\n\nThis is extremely difficult, dangerous, and frowned upon. [[Chronomancy]] allows one to move backwards, foreword, or even stop time. In all instances movement along this dimension is directly proportional to the users skill. To make things more achievable some users will attempt to send only their perspective elsewhere, allowing them to acquire information while risking much less.\n\nThis magic is used with the intention of keeping ones mind continuous while the timestream is broken. This makes it very difficult to perform. Failures can be cataclysmic, or relatively harmless. In terms of harmless failure, you could go backwards in time, but lose all your memory of doing so effectively accomplishing nothing. Alternatively one could freeze time but also freeze themselves in the process immediately ending the spell, uselessly expending great deals of energy.\n\nMore plausibly things will end up worse. A paradox could be created and cause the timeline to lash. A lashing timeline could manifest as something simple like dozens of surges of wild magic, summoning horrible beasts from the cosmos, or create tears in the planes. They could also manifest as something worse like mile long tendrils of raw energy tearing through the environment, or being removed from existence entirely.\n\nBecause of these high stakes, divine beings are known to intervene and punish those responsible.

It is an uncommon school. It is magic that involves the manipulation of [[Space]]. This manipulation allows a user to increase or decrease the space in a given area.\n\nThis magic is difficult to perform purely based on the sheer amount of focus it requires. It is done by moving the space from one location to another. It can be used to make a room much larger or smaller. Alternatively it can be used to move a target closer or further away from something.\n\nEnvironments changed by this influence are known to adapt intuitively to the changes in space. A room made smaller will have furniture, shrink, restyle or disappear to accommodate. A forest expanded will have plants emerge from the ground instantly in the newly opened expanse.\n\nThese changes however are temporary, and revert back after a few hours. Anything gained in the change disappears, anything lost reappears.\n\n[[Collapsation]] cannot be used to make living things, or magical objects disappear due to interference. If a manipulated space cannot accommodate these things the manipulation will stop at the closest possible point.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.629909475Z","tags":null},"/Conjuration":{"title":"","content":"# Conjuration\n[[Conjuration]] [[Magic]] is one of the [[Schools of Magic]]. It is magic that involves folding space for the purposes of teleportation, or bringing creatures and objects to, or away from a [[Caster]]. These usages of magic can span great distances [[Planes]] or even cross into other [[Planes]] given the skill of the user.\n\nIt requires one to understand their connection to their target very well, and be able to feel it through their [[Vizir]]. It is one of the hardest types of magic to perform.\n\nUsers of this type of magic are known to gift power to creatures they summon for their aid in daily life, transportation, and even battle. In most cases, creatures killed after being summoned through conjuration are returned to their previous location rather than dying.\n\n## Teleportation\nTeleportation is an extremely valuable skill to the society of [[Zol]]. Costing great deals of [[Gold]], teleportation is the safest and fastest method to move about [[Zol]].\n\nBefore [[The Great Tracks]], teleportation was the only consistent and safe way to get from once city to another. Making it only accessible to the rich or powerful [[Caster]]s.\n\nTeleportation distance is determined by skill, most who are capable of it can move themselves anywhere within The Three Corners of Civilization. \n\nThis limit on teleportation does make it ineffective for long distance expeditions into places like [[The Vast Sea]] and [[The Grand Nothing]]. One may argue that you could teleport very far, rest, then teleport again. This strategy however is unfortunately ineffective.\n\nTeleportation is based on familiarity of the current location, and the destination. The less familiar you are with either of these, the more dangerous the operation. If you are intending of teleporting one thousand miles east, you may end up one thousand feet into solid ground.\n\nThere are methods of mitigating and even completely removing these risks of teleportation. [[Teleportation Circles]] can be constructed and used as origin points or destinations when travelling. These circles take a long time to create. They are highly commodified pillars in society, and well guarded by their owners.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.629909475Z","tags":null},"/Daetro":{"title":"","content":"# Daetro\n*Wayward God of Fire, Minor Deity*\n![[Daetro.png]]\n\nLord of the flame, [[Daetro]] is the spirit of fire and the molten expanses that exist in [[Zol]].

[[Damnation]] is a subplane to [[The Void]] and home to [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] along with his legion of [[Fiends]].\n \n![[Damnation.png]]\n\n[[Damnation]] is divided into an unknown amount of layers. The known structure of [[Damnation]] is largely gained from reports given by the rare resurrected dead who were able to recall pieces of their time there.\n\nDamnation is home to [[Fiends]], and the souls of the dead.

It manifests as a vast city in colossal cavern. An ever present grey fog looms overheard. The fog glows a faint yellow light when it nears the ground providing the only natural illumination in Apolyatum.\n\n![[Apolyatum.png]]\n\nMortal souls placed here are all given a very similar, grey toned, physically healthy body that echoes their appearance from the middle point of their lives.\n\nAll are given a chance at making a comfortable, eternal life in Apolyatum. Everyone arrives in the city with 3 stone coins and simple clothing.\n\nHere they can live lives similar to that of the mortal world. Making friends, eating food, and experiencing niceties. They also face class discrimination, brutality, and other inconveniences similar to life.\n\nMany odd jobs unique to Apolyatum are available to the souls here, but mostly consist of excavating the cave walls, constructing new homes, and agriculture.\n\nA group of [[Fiends]] known as *The Regal* act as the nobility and policing force of Apolyatum. Many souls spend their days serving them, but some successful souls rise to noble ranks as well.\n\n## The Tomb of Stone\nThe maze of pain. A seemingly endless labyrinth of punishment and monsters. Souls guilty of crimes not quite worthy of eternal punishment are sent here.\n\n![[The Tomb of Stone.png]]\n\nIndestructible monoliths are scattered all over the maze. Glowing with faint green marks that house the souls of those who trapped within the labyrinth.\n\nBeings sent to the labyrinth are forced to play in a horrible, eternal game. They wake up in bodies at the base of the strange monoliths, with the knowledge that there are exits at the far reaches of the labyrinth that may lead to Apolyatum.\n\nThey are forced to make their way through the dangerous maze filled with torturous traps, mechanical monsters, and fiendish abominations. When the damned are inevitably killed within the Tomb of Stone, they wake up in a new body at the base of a monolith, rather than facing the effects of [[The Mortal Coil]]. It is not known how this works, but it is assumed that the bodies used by the punished are not their true form which is instead held within the monoliths.\n\nThis creates a society of beings who live in constant fear. Always running, hiding, fighting, and dying. Factions of these people rise and fall, and even social hierarchies form.\n\nSouls are made to reside here for a set amount of years based on their punishment. They are only allowed to leave once their sentence is complete, or they make it to one of the impossibly far doors leading to other layers of [[Damnation]].\n\n## Zaereza\nOnly two things are known about Zaereza. It is a vast and expansive collection Damnation's layers, one of which contains the palace of [[Aldem, King of all Hells]].

The lift operates over thousands of feet and can support extremely heavy burdens. Remarkably, the lift originally used no [[Magic]] in its operation.\n\nDesigned by Odile Gilligan, a gifted Halfling academic woman. Gilligan originally decided to construct the lift only using engineering to spark a movement against [[Zol]]'s over reliance on [[Magic]] wielding individuals. \n\n## Design\nBuilt as a wide platform suspended by a massive pulley system. Energy for moving the lift is drawn from massive turbines affixed to the wall of the cliff. Powered by the massive gusts of wind that blow vertically up the cliffs face, energy is stored in large springs. A wide platform acts as the lift itself, built of strong metals and wood to resists the same gusts that power it. This makes it capable of moving large quantities of personnel and equipment.\n\n![[Gilligans Lift.png]]\nSince the invention of [[Iron Light]], magical improvements have been made for durability, defense, and efficiency. However the core functionality remains non-magic due to its ingenious design. In modern days a one way trip of the lift takes 5 hours. \n\n## Impact on Society\nThe lift's operation was given to [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. This is because the guild has a reputation of neutrality on the political scale, making the lift accessible to any who would use it with good intentions.\n\nThe cost of operations and profits are managed by the guild, and nobility of [[Tenzentak]]. Security, maintenance, trade deals, tickets, passenger vetting, and staff are all needed to operate the lift.\n\nThe lifts creation marked the first accessible method of the common person being able to venture to the grand nothing. Previously it was only performed by those capable of teleportation.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.665909611Z","tags":null},"/Giriam":{"title":"","content":"# Giriam\n*Zolaen God of Agriculture, Fertility, Major Deity*\n![[Giriam.png]]\n\nThe caretaker of mortals.

They affect society by communicating with, or granting power to mortals. Some gods even take a mortal form to move amongst society. These influences can be well intended, or malicious in nature.\n\nThere are many gods that exist in [[Zol]], all with different intentions, morality, and powers. Some gods are supremely powerful, while others are limited in comparison. \n\nThe gods themselves have complex relationships with their peers that are not well understood by the civilizations of [[Zol]], society has organized them into pantheons to better discuss them.\n\n## Main Pantheons\nThe main pantheons are:\nPantheon | Description\n------------ | ------------\nThe [[Zolaen Gods]] | The creators of [[Zol]]. A pantheon of gods who act with [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their king. Doing everything they can to see his image of [[Zol]] come to fruition.\nThe [[Wayward Gods]] |  Beings of [[Zol]] who are as powerful as gods, but do not see [[The Watcher in The Door]] as their ruler. They act on their own accord.\nThe [[The Wandering Gods]] | A group of alien beings who appeared to mortals after [[The Undoing]]. Mysterious in nature these gods not act like the others. Some think they caused the [[The Undoing]], other think they are guardians; protecting mortals from the dangerous whims of other [[Gods]].\nThe [[Void Gods]] | Beings who hate [[Zol]]. They crawled out of the [[Sea of Monsters]] to destroy [[Zol]], and return it to the chaotic feast of power it once was.\n\n## \"God\" as a catch-all term for powerful beings\nThere are many beings who's primary focus is to rule over some dominion as a God. However, these are not the only beings that society refers to as a god. Any being or force of extreme power may be given this title by mortals, despite their true nature.\n\n## Minor vs Major Deities\nMinor Deities are beings who have a great deal of power that gives them a degree of uniqueness and domain over some aspect of [[Zol]]. These beings have the ability to not only influence their domain, but give power to other beings to carry out their will.\n\nMajor Deities are beings who are vastly more powerful than most other beings. Their power and influence is only kept in check by other Major Deities with a contradictory will, or great efforts of coordinated weaker beings. To these creatures, a single mortal is but a blip in the cosmos. \n\n## Wordbearers\nMortals who have achieved the ability to harness [[The First Tongue]] are known as [[Wordbearers]]. They are considered gods by some. It is not known how many [[Wordbearers]] there are, but the ones who are public play a large role in society.\n\n## Cosmic entities\nOutside of [[Zol]] and its planes, beyond the [[The Great Wall of Roots]], there lies an infinite cosmic expanse. Almost nothing is known of this strange outside world, but it is understood that the world of [[Zol]] itself may be the dead body of one of the cosmos' progenitors. \n\nThese progenitors, known as the [[Great Old Ones]] once ruled the cosmos, but were driven away from their former power by some reality bending event. All of what is known about these beings is considered to be legend.\n\nThese beings are known of, but bear little modern significance in the day to day lives of mortals.\n\n## Religion\nA complicated topic in a world with so much power, so many gods, and so little that is understood. \n\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] takes many shapes and forms.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.677909656Z","tags":null},"/Gohzul":{"title":"","content":"See [[Goh'zul, The Abyss]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.677909656Z","tags":null},"/Gold":{"title":"","content":"See [[Currency]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.677909656Z","tags":null},"/Grand-Forces":{"title":"","content":"# Grand Forces\nGrand Forces are the counterpart of [[Iron Light]].

However these beliefs are only held by a percentage of the population.\n\n## Social Issues\nDue to this theory, many believe their race is superiors to another. Cause discrimination, racism, war and slavery. Elves and Dwarves who think they are better than Humans. Humans who think they have dominion over the [[Off-Human]] races as their progenitor.

Residing within [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], Hanen is the smallest of the Alderian cities, but has a reputable history. During the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. The rebels of Hanen did not have the numbers that were originally needed for its defense. The rebels had overthrown the city, but were expected to lose it against the armies of [[Kapesh]] in the coming assault. Reinforcements could not cross the expanses to support the rebels within Hanen, as South Kapesh was crawling with enemy troops.\n\n![[hanen.png]]\n\n[[Kapesh]] attempted to retake take Hanen by siege, and failed. So they tried again, and failed. They even made for a third attempt and against all odds they failed. It was at this time support from [[Holocene]] arrived. Kapesh would never lay a boot on Hanen soil again.\n\nHistorians and tacticians speculated at what gave Hanen the means to defend their city for so long, but the most concrete explanation is the citizens of Hanen fought exceptionally well. The core reasoning for this exceptional fighting became prevalent over time.\n\nSome people of Hanen posses strange abilities, locally known as 'gifts'. A rare phenomenon, with each individual case manifesting uniquely. These abilities appear as physical or magical boons of power. Some obvious example of one possessing these powers may be able to breathe fire, climb vertical surfaces, see through walls, or manipulate the arc of a thrown object. More subtle manifestations appear as great skills. Some may not even recognize they have a 'gift'. No individual is known to posses more than one power.\n\nTypically these powers are passed down a bloodline with an approximate 1 in 3 success rate. However some citizens may be born with new power at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. The abilities first appear around age 10. Historically the powers have been increasing in frequency and potency. Hence the past confusion regarding the strength of those from [[Hanen]], as the powers used to be quite simple.\n\nEmpowered bloodlines are heavily sought after in modern day. Due to this, most noble houses are 'gifted'. Most notably House Trent. The wealthiest family in which almost all family members are 'gifted'.\n\nThe powers of [[Hanen]] waver if a 'gifted' individual spends more than 10 years from the city, but return fully when near  the city once again. 'Gifts' cannot be passed down when birth occurs away from the city. Some suspect this is because the source of the power comes from the Glass Lake.\n\nIdentifiable by its ivy covered, weathered and off-white stone walls. Hanen is a quaint place, and recommended to any who travel. Due to Hanen's location and strong population, it has one of the safest outer wilds, allowing for expansive farms, and a sense of ease.\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | A lucky few of the city's people are born with special powers called 'gifts' |\n| Main Challenge | The presence of these 'gifts' stokes an imbalance amongst the city's people. The 'ungifted' frequently experience mistreatment by some of the 'gifted'. The city's leadership faces many political hurdles in remedying this due to the high number of 'gifted' nobles.|\n| Climate | Temperate |\n| Cuisine | Farmed goods, hearty meat-and-potatoes meals, wild game, ales and mead |\n| Export | Agriculture, Mercenaries |\n| Size | Small |\n| City Leader | Poe Abbarand |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Wanderer-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Overgrown war-worn structures, Lakeside |\n| Architecture | Off-white stone walls, ivy covered, clay tile rooves |\n| Color(s) | Green and Gray |\n| Symbolism | A shield bearing three drops of blood arranged in a triangle |\n| Defenses | Lake-Navy, City Garrison, 'Gifted' Elites |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobility | Social Class | The wealthy and politician class, many of which have 'gifts' due to their family influence over time. |\n| Common folk | Social Class | The working class of farmers, craftsmen, and other service people. Most in the city live good lives, making for few beggars. The largest challenge these people face is the frequent tension cause by living in close quarters with 'gifted' individuals. Many of which have destructive or lethal powers, and a sense of superiority. Some common folk have 'gifts' as well. These individuals are frequently married into noble houses, or keep their powers relatively hidden to avoid social pressures. |\n| The 'Gifted' | Misc. | Locals to the city who are born with unique powers that grant magical or physical abilities. |\n| Church of the Wanderers | Religious | One of the largest congregations of [[Sworn Wanderers]] in all of [[Zol]]. Notable as much of [[Zol]] resists the Wanderer-Centric beliefs. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | The Citadel | Keep | The city's keep |\n | Church of the Wanderers | Church | A grand cathedral built in honor of [[The Wandering Gods]]. It is unique as most churches built to the honor of [[The Wandering Gods]] are humble in scale. |\n | East District | Market | The vast market district. Packed with many small restaurants and taverns. It notably contains no clear magic shop. Magical items can be found at various vendors selling odds and ends or Artificers' services. |\n | Wagons' | Tavern | A large and simple tavern. The most popular of its competition, frequented by the Common folk. |\n | The Lucky Few | Tavern | A higher scale tavern, frequented by the 'gifted' |\n | Sozaren Academy | Sword's College | An exclusive institution with the aim of training 'gifted' into skilled warriors. Located in Last Stand. Known to export remarkable fighters. |\n | Hanen Station | Train Station | The city's train station |\n | Hanen Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The City's sole teleportation circle. Located in The Citadel. |\n\n## Authority\nThe city is overseen by Poe Abbarand, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Hanen]]. Lord Abbarand is an old honorable [[Half-Elf]] man. Despite the cities culture and history, Lord Abbarand possesses no 'gift', despite his bloodline. He has always had a vision of growing [[Hanen]]. It is a small city with no shortage of resources and much potential.\n\nUnfortunately, he spends most of his time settling squabbles amongst the noble houses and cleaning up messes caused by the 'gifted'. Despite his honor and efforts, his inability to exercise his authority upon the 'gifted' has given him a reputation of being spineless.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]] as well as enforcing its own laws.\n\n| Law | Severity | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Misuse of 'gifts' | Medium | If one uses their 'gift' to harm, intimidate, or manipulate another without due cause they are to be jailed in the keep's dungeon. (Note that despite this laws existence, it is rarely enforced. If it is enforced, the sentencing is very short.) |\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn modern day, Hanen is known for giving rise to many strong warriors that make an impact all across [[Zol]]. \n\nIt is also known to be a nice destination to visit. This is because of its safe location between [[Ka'thoor]] and [[Hanen]]. This allows one to venture out into the wilderness with little risk. A rare thing in eastern [[Zol]].\n\n## Historical Importance\nKnown for withstanding siege during the [[Alderian Rebellion]] against impossible odds.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- It is expected in the next centaury, the presence of 'gifts' and their power will plateau.\n- Many 'gifts' give moderate power, but there are the special few who's abilities far exceed that of their peers.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.677909656Z","tags":null},"/Heliodor":{"title":"","content":"# Heliodor\n\n## The Creation of Heliodor\nLong after [[Laenwalde]] had recovered from the [[The Castle of Bodies]] attack on [[Audran]], the kingdom was still without a clear capital.\n\nTo remedy this, the nobility came up with a frivolous design that [[Artificers]] of [[The University]] made into reality.

These races, known as [[The Triumvirate]] used the power of [[The Trinity]] to create an advanced and prosperous society. Sprawling cities of life, art and culture once graced Zol. This was all lost in [[The Undoing]].\n\nNot much is known about the time before [[The Undoing]], or what caused it. Ancient texts tell stories of a heinous act made by the humans. It is thought to have been a scheme that would turn humanity so far from the light, the [[Gods]] punished all of Zol for the crime. Others believe it was caused by [[The Wandering Gods]], the divine alien force that made themselves known to mortals a century after [[The Undoing]].\n\nSince it is not known which gods or forces in [[Zol]] enacted [[The Undoing]], many theories try to explain the event, or cast blame on specific gods. Said blame has caused a history's worth of debate, discrimination, and even war.\n\nRegardless of which force caused it. [[The Undoing]] obliterated uncountable tracts of land, reducing them to dust, creating [[The Grand Nothing]]. All beings were banished to the furthest intact corners of Zol, forcing them to begin anew with no knowledge of the old world. The [[Gods]] refuse any question asked to them regarding the event.\n\nSome believe the final punishment of the humans was to have their [[Great Magic]] stripped from them, and fractured. From this revoked magic, the gods created a cast of new races to bear the burden of humanity's sin. These would known as the [[Off-Human]] Races.\n\nIn their new home, the sapient world began to atone, rebuild, relearn what was lost. Ages passed for Zol. What was once a nation of refugees now resembled a society, but with only a fraction of its former glory. In these times, only the strong and powerful had true agency, as the [[Untamed Wilds of Zol]] were too dangerous for the common folk. Zol struggled against the natural forces day in and day out. This all changed when the first spark of [[Iron Light]] was struck.\n\nThe powerful mage [[Mordenkainen]] devised a way for the common folk to capture and utilize the magic of [[The Trinity]]. Complex diagrams and runes scratched onto the surface of iron slabs allowed for simple magical devices that changed Zol forever.\n\nCommunication devices, agricultural advances, medical wonders, and many other wonderful things were created using [[Iron Light]]. Most notably, [[The Great Tracks]] were built to span the dangerous, and once unpassable distances between nations. Common folk were given the agency over their own fate, and Zol began to prosper for the first time since [[The Undoing]].\n\nNow Zol sits, in an unprecedented time of opportunity.

Examples of this are long distance communication devices, flying machines, [[Warforged]], [[Automail]], weather and navigational systems, and even the [[Trains]] of [[The Great Tracks]].\n\n## Production and Economic/Societal Value of Apparatum\nThe creation of Apparatum is proportional to skill, quality of materials, and complexity of the design. Some designs take hours, while other take days or weeks. Individuals who create [[Apparatum]] are known as [[Artificers]].\n\nAs it takes much training to complete even a simple [[Apparatum]], they are costly. Those of the lowest economic status would be lucky to own even a single [[Apparatum]], while those of common wealth will typically own one to three. For nobility, [[Apparatum]] are common place items. Their lavish homes are usually full of devices to increase their general quality of life.\n\nIn most civilized cities, there are common [[Apparatum]] that exist for use in business, or pubic benefit. These may be lamps that light the streets at night, or things like the [[Rift Smog]] filters in [[Tenzentak]]. Some civilizations have very particular views on [[Iron Light]]. The people of [[The Ward]] outlaw the usage of [[Apparatum]] based in spiritual belief.\n\n## Advancements in Iron Light\nIron light was originally limited to a small set of [[Ferric Alphabet]] runes, and slow production via iron engraving. Soon after the name was widely adopted, more symbols and compatible materials, and techniques were discovered.\n\nThe mediums to support Iron light spread to carpentry, glass working, alchemy, leathercraft, weaving, painting, smiting, and various other crafts. Each with their own pros and cons. The name, which references the purple light the runes emanate when active had already stuck. Fortunately, all techniques require some iron to be present to work. Be it metal inlay, infused materials, or special tools used in creation.\n\nA very popular and reliable technique was discovered for short term Iron Light solutions. A special material called [[Chalkstone]] was found to be very compatible with iron and allows for quick, and relatively accurate creation of [[Apparatum]] that last a small number of months. This is commonly used in novice work, prototyping, mass production, and education. Unfortunately devices made with chalkstone are easily destroyed by water damage.\n\n## Discovery\nThe Arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] at the end of the [[First Age]]. He observed common patterns in the damage created by [[Magical Backfire]]. By intentionally increasing the damage of [[Magical Backfire]], he was able to spot runes amongst the damage.\n\nOne of these runes was found to appear elsewhere. In [[Necromancy]], a phenomenon called a [[Death Scar]] matched exactly to [[Mordenkainen]]'s findings. This led to many other successive discoveries of similar nature. These found runes would later be called the [[Ferric Alphabet]].\n\nAfter much experimentation with the runes, their interaction with iron was discovered. A decade of experimentation led to a single working lamp, and a basic theory of [[Iron Light]].\n\nLittle is known about why [[Iron Light]] actually works. It is widely accepted that there lies something within the properties of iron that mimics a living body, allowing it to share the powers of one's [[Vizir]].\n\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is assumed to be some product of [[The First Tongue]]. Since there is very little known about the origin of both subjects, the practice largely operates on assumption in this area.\n\n## The Ferric Alphabet\nThe [[Ferric Alphabet]] is a wide set of runes that represent the aspect of [[Zol]] like [[Space, Matter, and Energy]] as well as the complex relationships between them. These runes are organized in an infinite amount of configurations to accomplish [[Enchantment]].\n\nThe alphabet is thought to be incomplete, and many academics spend their lives searching for more runes. Missing runes are symbolized by the combination of known runes, this is referred to as [[Imperfect Representation]]. For example, glass is represented with light and stone, along with a complex nexus of supporting runes to ensure the combination is successful.\n\n## Negatives to Iron Light\n[[Iron Light]] is revolutionary due to how accessible it makes [[magic]], but it is not nearly as powerful as [[Enchantment]] made from [[Grand Forces]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] also demands the usage of one's [[Vizir]], and in turn can be very exhausting if overused. Long term usage of complex [[Apparatum]] causes a rare magical disease called [[Materiation]]. This is only seen when the Apparatum in question requires an abundance of [[Imperfect Representation]]. \n\n[[Materiation]] causes the afflicted's body to slowly change to a different material state. It is most often seen amongst [[artificers]] and those who operate complex [[Apparatum]] as a part of their career.\n\nThis could manifest as holes in the body that slowly pour out smoke, appendages that become plantlike, or famously like the conductors of [[The Great Tracks]] who turn to iron. Though gruesome, the condition is painless and described by the victims as euphoric.\n\n## Iron Light in relation to Grand Forces\n[[Iron Light]] [[Enchantment]] is limited due to the fact it depends on the Vizir of an individual. Its more powerful counterpart, [[Grand Forces]], are not limited in this way. Objects of this nature are much more rare and powerful.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.685909686Z","tags":null},"/Kahdinacht":{"title":"","content":"![[kahdinacht.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.689909701Z","tags":null},"/Kapesh":{"title":"","content":"# Kapesh\nKapesh, The Human Kingdom of [[Zol]].

Kapesh is ruled by [[King Galliard]] from its capital, [[Kierketholl]]. Bordering [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and [[The Witchlands]], Kapesh finds itself the most central kingdom in The Three Corners of Civilization.\n\nKapesh is the oldest kingdom in Zol, as it was founded shortly after [[The Undoing]]. The [[Humans]] were scorned by the elves, dwarves, and gods. This made lives for the people of [[Kapesh]] more difficult at first, but quickly gave humans a reason to unify at a much faster rate than any other faction in all of [[Zol]]. [[Humans]] are known for their stubbornness in the face of resistance.\n\nKapesh's borders once included what is now the [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]. When Kapesh first rose to power, all [[Off-Human]] races within its borders were heavily oppressed and many were forced to live as slaves. This was changed by The [[Alderian Rebellion]]. A civil war in which Kapesh lost its southern region to what is now known as The Free Cities of Alderun.\n\nThere is lots of superstition that regards humans as cursed, this belief is furthered by the problems that Kapesh has faced over the course of its existence. A kingdom located in a considerably inhospitable region filled with monsters, as well as a volatile population. It has faced unique and isolated plagues and famine. \n\nThey are also known for waging war in the past against [[Gethsemane]] multiple times. Known as The [[Triumvirate Battles]], the conflicts never amounted to much other than unnecessary deaths. The only territory that has ever changed hands in this exchange was Stalke Island and the city of [[Riverbridge]].\n\nKapesh is home to many practitioners of [[Arcana]], most notably at [[The Kybis Assembly]]. Little fact is written on what exactly occurs there. On its surface it is a scholarly place of magic. The rumor mill however, spins stories of arcanists who tamper with the dark unknown forces of Zol.\n\n## The Kapesh Wilds \nThe Wilds of [[Kapesh]] consist of strange expanses, and dangerous forests that spill over from [[The Witchlands]]. While unsafe, [[Kapesh]] contains natural beauties and wonders unlike that of any other region.\n\nDeep valleys holding winding rivers, flora and fauna that thrive in its mist covered wilds, and open landscapes marred by magical warfare that left hauntingly elegant scars.\n\nThose who live out in the wilds are either sturdy bandits, or natives to [[The Witchlands]] who care not for the borders of civilization.\n\nMonsters and thieves make straying from the roads of [[Kapesh]] dangerous for all who cannot hold their own.\n\nKapesh contains the Mountain Ranges:\n- [[Demodemacht]]\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\nKapesh has coastlines on:\n- [[The Narrow Sea]]\n- [[The Archsea]]\n\nKapesh Borders the Regions:\n- [[The Free Cities of Alderun]]\n- [[The Witchlands]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.689909701Z","tags":null},"/Kathoor":{"title":"","content":"# Ka'thoor\n*Trade, culture, and loveable chaos*\n![[kathoor skyline.png]]\n\nKa'thoor, the Orcish City.

This is largely do to its proximity to [[The Witchlands]], as [[Beastfolk]] from that region will travel through Kapesh (avoiding its xenophobic culture) to make trades in Ka'thoor.\n\nThis environment makes Ka'thoor one of the most unique cities in all of Alderun.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.689909701Z","tags":null},"/Kerndall":{"title":"","content":"See [[Kerndall, the Feral King]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.689909701Z","tags":null},"/Ki":{"title":"","content":"# Ki\nA method of harnessing one's [[Vizir]] to enhance the physical body.

It manifests in 3 ways called [[The Wills]]. \n\n![[spheres of magic diagram.png]]\n\nIt is the poorly understood force that drives everything in [[Zol]].\n\n- [[Observance]], which is magic lent by beings of great power or derived from a spiritual bond formed with the soul of the world itself. Each individual who utilizes this will does so in a manner that is entirely unique to them. It can manifest as a radiant light that guides those who are lost, a dark power that draws in the vulnerable, and everything in between.\n- [[Viridescence]], which is magic found everywhere in nature. A source which requires great understating of, or domination over the natural world. This power allows anyone to bend nature to their will, and even bend their own form to that of the natural world.\n- [[Arcana]], the unbalanced, untied, and chaotic power that saturates [[Zol]]. Arcana can be harnessed in an uncountable number of ways, but even scratching the surface of just one of these methods requires great knowledge, talent, and years of practice; however some gifted individuals can perform these acts based on their innate ability alone. Study of the Arcane can show one the great and wonderful secrets of the world, but can also drive some to madness.\n\n[[The Wills]] come from [[The Trinity]] and the rules that bind it called [[The First Tongue]]. This binding formed the very stone, sea, and sky of [[Zol]]. As well as the Magic that resides in it. By this rule, all magic in [[Zol]] must adhere to [[The Wills]] even if it hails from outside [[Zol]].\n\n[[The First Tongue]] itself is a power one can learn to control. It allows one to bend the rules of [[Zol]], as it is in its essence the rules themselves. Individuals who achieve full and uncontested mastery over a facet [[Zol]] may discover a piece of [[The First Tongue]]. In doing so they can perform wonderous feats of magic akin to that the [[Gods]]. This is the rarest and most difficult skill in all of [[Zol]].\n\nAs use of [[The First Tongue]] is nigh impossible, other methods of harnessing the wills are utilized by the bulk of magic wielders in Zol. These other methods are:\n- [[Vizir]], a fragment of the Trinity that exists in all beings. When harnessed it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way.\n- [[The Old Tongue]], the language that followed [[The First Tongue]]. While it is not nearly as powerful, it is much more diverse. It allows one to wield [[The Wills]] in a major way. Knowledge of this force may come with great secrets and dark truths about Zol.\n- [[Lent Power]], is power given by some wonderous source or great being other than [[The Trinity]]. When this power is bestowed upon an individual, it allows for them to channel the power of a greater being through their [[Vizir]] or learn [[The Old Tongue]] through a divine entity. This power cannot come from outside of [[The Trinity]] entirely. As all magic in [[Zol]] must be passed through it before reaching its intended target.\n\n![[Magic Diagram.png]]\n\n## Magic and Society\nThe people of [[Zol]] largely base their society and culture around some sort of magic. Safety and technology at a high level depend almost entirely on magic. This creates a strange dynamic for most of the population as only about 4% of individuals have the capacity to harness magic via gifts or training.\n\n[[Caster]]s are revered and feared because of this. The cultures and mythos of [[Zol]] are so intertwined with magic that no belief or practice is without mention of it.\n\n## Advancements in Magic\nFor almost of history, one could not access magical power unless they followed the specific known rules, or possessed an item that had undergone [[Enchantment]] via superbly powerful magic. This was all changed when the great arcanist [[Mordenkainen]] discovered [[Iron Light]] and established the trade of [[Artificers]].\n\n[[Iron Light]] is a sub section of the minor will of [[Arcana]]. It allows one to extend their [[Vizir]] into an object, or channel [[The Trinity]] itself through the object. This is done by using rudimentary runes inscribed in iron plates, allowing for a more simplistic production of magical objects. This invention revolutionized [[Zol]].\n\n## Limitations and Weaknesses of Magic\nWhile powerful, Magic is not a boundless tool. In all cases, a [[Caster]] acts as a conduit for [[The Trinity]]. Acting as this conduit requires capacity and fortitude called **Equipoise**, respective to the given task.  \n\nEquipoise is a medical term used to denote the balance of ones homeostasis, mental state, and magical capability. It is a careful balance that the body strives towards at all times. Every being has a different level of this balance. Some beings can withstand more imbalance than others.\n\nUse of any Magic, save for [[The First Tongue]], directly interferes with one's Equipoise. This can manifest as the body dropping in temperature, exhaustion, hunger, nausea, weakness, dizziness, and temporarily decreased magical ability.\n\nIt is common for novice mages to become bedridden for a few hours after their first use of magic. Skilled mages do not even notice these negative effects when using simple spells.\n\nEquipoise can be trained like a muscle over time, and seems to have no upward limit. This skill is thought to be parallel, or even interchangeable, with the strength of ones [[Vizir]]. \n\nWhen one stops using magic, the body does what it can to return to a normal Equipoisal state; however it cannot recover lost energy. This means a body can only take so much stress before it needs hours of rest to regain lost Equipoise. \n\nStress can be mitigated by expanding one's Equipoisal capacity. If an individual has great skill, or some innate gift they can use magic in more efficient ways to lessen the equipoisal imbalance. The amount of magic a [[Caster]] can use before causing permanent damage to themselves is referred to as their equipoisal limit. \n\nIf one does reach their equipoisal limit, they are not cut off from magic. They are instead punished greatly by any further usage. This is called [[Magical Backfire]].\n\n## Perspectives of Magic\nMuch of what is written and taught about [[magic]] comes from Academic Arcanists. In modern times, the public understanding of [[magic]] is somewhat biased towards the academic perspective. [[Clerics]], [[druids]], occultists, [[witches]], and many more have perspectives of magic that differ greatly, and even sometimes contradict the academic perspective. \n\nMost cases of [[magic]] usage outside of academia are not recorded, tested, and debated like they are in Academic [[Arcana]]. This is because each usage is much more unique and personal. There is also much less need for it as these groups tend to begin their journey with gifts, or help from an outside source.\n\n## Categories of Magic\nThe usage of magic gives off a unique informational [[energy]] signature no matter the source, will used, or the [[Caster]] themselves. These signatures are called the [[Schools of Magic]] and they tell much about the nature of the magic being used.\n\n## Forces Beyond Magic\nMany believe magic to be an all encompassing force to describe [[Zol]], but there are some who believe there is other power within the world that does not come from [[Zol]] and even operate outside of [[The Trinity]]. Any academic evidence of this is purely theoretical, and is largely viewed as some portion of [[The Trinity]] that is not yet understood. Some theologians however, claim to be quite sure of these sources of power. A large example of this is that of the [[Church of The Hum]] in [[Holyfield]]\n\nThe popularized theories for other sources are:\n- [[The Hum]] - a strange force that exists in [[Holyfield]]\n- [[The Mortal Coil]] - the force of life and death itself. Many Believe it to be part of [[The Trinity]], but others disagree based on the nature of the [[Planes]] and [[Necromancy]].\n- [[The Anger of the Stars]] - a strange phenomenon observed as power that radiates from somewhere deep in [[The Cosmos]].\n- [[The Anti-Trinity]] - a mythical force associated with [[The Shroud of the Void]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.689909701Z","tags":null},"/Magical-Backfire":{"title":"","content":"# Magical Backfire\nMagical backfire is the result of improper usage or over-usage of [[magic]].

The Ocean covers many of these fissures and allows [[Ohlit]] to monitor anything that may try to bridge the gap between worlds.\n\nThe Sea-God sends armies of his creation to war against [[The Void]] in an endless effort to hold back the evils that lurk deep beneath [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.705909762Z","tags":null},"/Old-Zol":{"title":"","content":"# Old Zol\nThe highly advanced civilization of [[Zol]] that existed in [[The Before]].

A product of thousands upon thousands of worlds cultivated, and consumed like livestock. Worlds made to sustain cosmic beings called the [[Great Old Ones]]. Amongst these cultivated worlds, one grew strong enough to fight back, and imprison its creator in [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. \n\nThe being's name was [[Goh'zul]]. In his prison, the Great Old One was forced to slowly starve and rot away. As he did, his body attracted a myriad of creatures from all across the cosmic sea. They gorged on his infinite body for eons, forming The [[Sea of Monsters]]. Each and every being who partook in the flesh of the decaying god gradually lost their physical characteristics, devolving into worm like creatures. \n\nAt the heart of the writhing sea, was the once core of the Great Old One. A heart of black stone called [[Oblivion]], and is home to The Great Old One's Soul. A Being called [[The Wretch]]. Since the defeat and imprisonment of the Great Old One, it has become the site of an everlasting duel. A fight between The Wretch, and the first being he ever consumed.\n\nWhen [[Goh'zul]] fell from power, the consumed man swore an oath to never let the creature return to its true strength. He guarded the sole door to the heart of The Great Old One, fighting tooth and nail, to prevent the escape of [[The Wretch]]. Declaring himself [[The Watcher in The Door]].\n\nAfter an age of fighting, The Watcher had reached his limit, in a final attempt at securing his victory, he wounded the immortal Wretch, so gravely it could do not but flee and hide in the dark corners of its prison. In this victory, The Watcher decided to leave [[Oblivion]], and take a new approach to his oath.\n\nHe made demands of the sea, speaking a new language called [[The First Tongue]]. His divine words struck order to the chaos. The Watcher demanded the bravest and greatest creatures, who still held onto a fragment of their past dignity must create a pact, and become his pantheon of [[Gods]].\n\nHe and his pantheon bent the sea of monsters to their will by speaking this new holy language, [[The First Tongue]]. In shaping the new world, they bound the infinite power that laid inside the Great Old One into a force called [[The Trinity]]. It would have been a paradise in its design, if not for [[The Wretch]]. \n\nFrom the confines of his prison, it whispered a dark tongue of his own. It's speech leaked from the unguarded door. The primal power clung to the words of the new gods, twisting them at their corners into dark machinations of his design.\n\nThis left the last sentient fragment of The Great Old One as a husk, but its poison would live on outside, in the newly birthed world of [[Zol]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.705909762Z","tags":null},"/Planes":{"title":"","content":"# The Planes of Zol\n[[Zol]] itself is a parent realm. A plane which contains many other planes all anchored to a [[Prime Material Plane]]. The sheer number of planes in [[Zol]] is not known. Planar travel poses many challenges, and most mortals know little of anything outside the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Despite this, the powerful and arcane citizens of [[Zol]] have recorded a fair deal about the [[Planes]].\n\n![[Diagram of the cosmos.png]]\n\n[[Planes]] were first created from the [[Sea of Monsters]] by [[The Watcher in The Door]]. [[The Watcher]] did not transform the majority of the [[Sea of Monsters]] into [[Zol]], but did manage to harness a great deal of it. What is left of the [[Sea of Monsters]] is now known as [[The Void]].\n\nAll planes in [[Zol]] are are anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]], which is the resting place of [[The Trinity]], and home to The Three Corners of Civilization.\n\nAll planes float amongst [[The Ethos]], the local section of the universe that stops at [[The Great Wall of Roots]]. Beyond that lies [[The Cosmos]] which spans on forever.\n\n## List of All Planes\nThere are many planes in [[Zol]]. Below is the list of known major planes.\n- **The Mortal Planes** - Planes bound by the rule of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[Prime Material Plane]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Zol]] and resting place of [[The Trinity]]. Being the source of all magical power, and the anchor for all other planes, it is the focal point for all of [[Zol]].\n\t- [[Fey]]\n\t\t- A fantastical reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where nature an beauty run rampant. While enticing, the [[Fey]] is very dangerous.\n\t- [[Fell]]\n\t\t- A dark and mysterious reflection of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. An echo where shadows and thorns grow from a hauntingly beautiful, and extremely dangerous landscape.\n\t- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\t\t- The fraying edges of the [[Prime Material Plane]], where the elemental forces of nature stop overlapping one another. Appearing on diagrams like the drawing of a child who has colored outside of the lines. [[The Elemental Planes]] jut out of the [[Prime Material Plane]] creating worlds that solely embody a single aspect of nature. They are strange realms rarely traversed by foreigners.\n- **The Outer Planes** - Planes that are not bound by [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t- [[The Cliffs of Aeordel]]\n\t\t- The Castle of [[The Watcher]] and his close allies\n\t- [[The Moons]]\n\t\t- A group of ancient planets that once existed freely in [[The Cosmos]], but were consumed by [[Goh'zul]]. Before he could fully digest them, he was defeated. Leaving a set of strange ruined worlds that orbit one another in [[Zol]]'s sky.\n\t\t- [[The Forgotten Heavens]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Moons]]. The once abandoned divine plane attached to these ancient worlds. Now inhabited by [[The Night Empress]] and her court.\n\t- [[The Palace of Drole]]\n\t\t- An endless palace inhabited by [[Yanneran]] and his chosen dead. A place of constant celebration and art.\n\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t- Where the fateless dead are sent by [[The Coilwalker]] to have their future determined.\n\t- [[Absurdia]]\n\t\t- One of the most bizarre aspects of [[Zol]]. It is described as a sort of parody of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Its inhabitants are very odd, and those that travel to it tell tales of strange events that almost sound like comical children's stories mixed with accounts of great violence.\n\t- [[The Unknown Realm]]\n\t\t- The home of [[The Wandering Gods]]\n\t- [[The Immortal Ocean]]\n\t\t- A realm of only water and light, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant. Accessible only to those who are not invited by its ruler [[Ohlit]].\n\t- [[The Pure Forest]]\n\t\t- A beautiful infinitely spanning forest brought into existence by [[The Lifeweaver]]'s presence, existing at the furthest edges of the Elemental Plane of Invigorant.\n\t- [[Elm Manor]]\n\t\t- The artificial plane constructed by [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].\n\t- [[The Storm Horizon]]\n\t\t- The origin of [[Adrathar, Father of the Wind]]'s storms.\n- **Unique Planar Manifestations** - Planes, or things very similar to planes, that have their own set of rules that is unique to them.\n\t- [[The Void]]\n\t\t- The Remnants of the [[Sea of Monsters]]. The size and scope of [[The Void]] is not know by even the [[Gods]]. It exists directly underneath the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It contains evils incomprehensible to mortals, and is only held back by the efforts of the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t\t- [[Damnation]]\n\t\t\t- A subplane of [[The Void]]. It is an amalgamation of all hells ever consumed by [[Goh'zul]], and is ruled by the terrifying demon [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. It is accessible in the deepest darkest caverns that span at the bottom of [[The Underdark]].\n\t- [[The Ethos]]\n\t\t- The space that surrounds all of [[Zol]]'s planes. It is essentially the lack of a plane. The whole universe exists floats amongst this manifestation of reality, [[The Ethos]] is merely the local section of it.\n\t\t- [[The Ethos]] is also bound by [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t- [[The Cosmos]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Ethos]] and [[The Great Wall of Roots]].\n\t- [[The Ethereal Plane]]\n\t\t- Not truly a plane at all. Some call it The Cognitive Realm, others call it The Plane of Souls. [[The Ethereal Plane]] is the wavelength of reality that souls exist on. It overlaps all of [[Zol]]. It is possible to interface directly with [[The Ethereal Plane]] and even travel through it.\n\t- [[Oblivion]]\n\t\t- The heart of [[Goh'zul]]. Little is known about [[Oblivion]]. Scripture talks of it being the battle ground between [[The Watcher]] and [[The Wretch]]. It is said to have a sole entrance called simply *The Door*, and is thought to still contain what little is left of [[Goh'zul]].\n\t- [[The Space Outside Reality]]\n\t\t- What lies beyond [[The Cosmos]]. Also known as The Far Realm.\n\n## Subplanes\nSubplanes are planes that are created within another plane. They inherit all the rules their parent plane subscribes to.\n\nExample: [[Artificers]] create the common [[Apparatum]] known as a Bag of Holding. This device is a fabric sac that contains a portal to an artificial plane that merely contains space for storing objects. If this Bag of Holding is brought to the [[Prime Material Plane]] the space inside the bag is bound to [[The Mortal Coil]], if it is brought to [[Absurdia]] it is not.\n\n## The Two Types of Planes: Planets and Realms\nA planet is a discrete, usually spherical plane that floats freely amongst [[The Cosmos]]. [[The Moons]] of [[Zol]] are a good example of this. Planets typically have some central point of gravity that keeps objects on its surface. Planets do not usually have other planes bound to them in any way other than gravitational orbit of other planets.\n\nRealms are planes that are not necessarily discrete and do not have to subscribe to Euclidean Geometry. They may be infinite, repeating, fractal, or end abruptly at their edges.\n\nIn [[The Cosmos]], Parent realms are usually discerned by some sort of barrier between them and the rest of the universe. They typically contain many lesser planes bound to a [[Prime Material Plane]], as well as their own local section of [[The Cosmos]] similar to [[The Ethos]].\n\nPlanets can exist on their own or within a realm. Realms are rarely contained by a planet, but Realms usually contain other realms.\n\n## Artificial Planes\nPlanes that are not found already existing in [[Zol]] are called Artificial Planes. They are newly created, and typically temporary in the cosmic scale.\n\nThey can manifest at any size and can be produced intentionally or by wild magic. The can exist as planets or realms.\n\nConstructing a plane intentionally is very difficult and requires immense skill. The size, specifications, and permanency of the plane depends on the ability of the creator.\n\nA good example of this is the plane of [[Elm Manor]], home to [[Draedon, the Ascended Wizard]].

He did so by manufacturing a disease called [[Beast Ire]]. A condition that caused madness and mutations. Converting mortals into feral beasts who hunted their own kin. Devouring hundreds and spreading the disease to others.\n\nThe disease eventually mutated in such a way where it could infect beasts as well. Causing them to take on horrifying forms. [[Kerndall]] was forced to contain the ailment within himself to save [[Zol]]. Maddening him and turning him into a horrible monster now under the control of [[The Wasp Eater]].\n\nRalatas will not take the title of king until his father has been slain.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Rali-Trunsarr":{"title":"","content":"See [[The Page of Cups]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Reduced-Magic":{"title":"","content":"# Reduced Magic\nAn informational [[energy]] signature given off by very basic magic.

The presence of the [[Gods]] is very well known, but their methods, intentions, and origins are largely a mystery.\n\nReligion in Zol takes many forms. Some undergo their practice as an individual journey, or participate in one of the many [[Religious Organizations]]. There many churches, sects, cults, traditions, and practices. All with their own unique belief systems to make sense of the complex world of [[Zol]] and its mysterious [[Gods]].\n\n## Major Beliefs\nThere is a vast number of perspectives from which [[Zol]] and its [[Gods]] are understood. Most of which can be summarized by these 6 categories. Ordered from most common to least common:\n\n- ### Zolaen-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 40% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[Zolaen Gods]] created [[Zol]] and are the true and holy rulers of it. This belief system also subscribes to the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are malicious, or at the very least not to be trusted. This is because Zolaen-Centric belief blames [[The Undoing]] on the [[Zolaen Gods]]. It also entails that the [[Wayward Gods]] are dangerous and not to be trusted due to their chaotic nature.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship one or many of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Regardless of their specific method of worship, it is generally thought that one should pay respect and worship to all of the [[Zolaen Gods]] from time-to-time.\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with, or rather an extension of, the [[Zolaen Gods]].\n\t- Shares harmony with Trinity-Centric Beliefs\n\n- ### Trinity-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 30% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based in the general idea that the pantheons of [[Gods]] are not the true ultimate power. They instead believe that [[The Trinity]] itself is the only thing deserving of worship. In this system, the [[Gods]] are either mere extensions of [[The Trinity]], or false gods who stray the light of [[The Trinity]]. This system also typically believes in a dark reflection of [[The Trinity]] called [[The Anti-Trinity]]. This dark power is seen as the source of all evil and darkness, and that all of the [[Void Gods]] are mere extensions of it.\n\t- Followers of this belief may worship [[The Trinity]] as a whole or some specific manifestation of it. Like the [[Church of Three Fires]].\n\t- Additionally, [[Wordbearers]] who serve the greater good are thought to be in alignment with the [[The Trinity]].\n\t- Shares harmony with Zolaen-Centric Beliefs\n\n- ### Wanderer-Centric Belief\n\t- *Roughly 10% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea that the [[The Wandering Gods]] are more of guardians rather than [[Gods]]. They are thought to have come to [[Zol]] to protect civilization from the unchecked power of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. As per this belief system, [[The Undoing]] is seen as the fault of the [[Zolaen Gods]]. Those who subscribe to this theory also believe that the [[Wayward Gods]] and [[Wordbearers]] are not all inertly bad.\n\t- Followers of this belief see [[The Wandering Gods]] more as mentors rather than omnipotent rulers, guiding them in their struggles.\n\t- With only a fifth of the following compared to Trinity Centric or Zolaen Centric\n\n- ### Polytheism\n\t- *Roughly 10% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system recognizes each god as an individual being, and does not judge them based on their pantheon. Followers of this belief typically focus on a single god, or small group of gods based on the individuals selection. This system typically operates under the assumption that [[The Undoing]] was caused by the [[Gods]], but it is not know which gods. So judgement is not cast.\n\n- ### Atheism\n\t- *Roughly 8% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system operates based on the assumption that mortals need not revere [[Gods]], as they are merely beings. Their power does not make them holy, only more present in [[Zol]]. The specific ideas differ from person to person, but largely revolves around skepticism towards information about the gods divined through worship.\n\n- ### Void Worship\n\t- *Roughly 2% of [[Zol]]'s population follow this belief system*\n\t- This belief system is based on the idea of sacrifice in exchange for power from the [[Void Gods]]. A taboo practice in all of society, this belief is a dangerous and dark practice. Individuals who practice this faith are known for having twisted world views.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Religious-Organizations":{"title":"","content":"# Religious Organizations\n[[Religion]] in [[Zol]] is a complex thing.

These three concepts are all one and the same, merely in different states. These states can be bound and influenced, or shifted to another state using [[Sympathetic bonds]].\n- Academic Arcanists understand [[Zol]] an **infinite four dimensional grid of nodes**. Each one of these nodes are fragment [[The Trinity]], and exist in one of the three states: Space, Matter and Energy.\n\t- If you were to pick two points in space, each of these points could be represented as one node. In-between these two points there are an infinite number of other nodes.\n\t- One does not consider how they are acting on these states directly, this is merely a product of the used [[magic]]. Acting on nodes differs greatly given the state that the node is in:\n\t\t- **Acting on space** can modify gravity, teleport objects, and open portals.\n\t\t- **Acting on matter** can change the form, strength and mass of something.\n\t\t- **Acting on energy** is the most complex, useful, and frequently used task of an arcanist. Energy can be applied, removed, transferred, and observed. The types of energy are\n\t\t\t- Kinetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that moves things. It is produced in a number of different ways, but largely is based around the motion of matter. Can be transferred quite easily with [[Sympathetic bonds]]. It used to both apply forces, and create/mask sound.\n\t\t\t- Heat\n\t\t\t\t- Different, but intersectional with the Elemental energy of fire. Heat energy is the energy created reactions, be it magical, biological, or alchemical. Heat energy can be channeled in and out of systems in large quantities with only a single bond.\n\t\t\t- Light\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that is produced by most alchemical reactions, and the presence of [[magic]]. It can both illuminate and darken. Used to create illusions, make things invisible, illuminate rooms,  and mask things in darkness.\n\t\t\t- Gravitational\n\t\t\t\t- The force of attraction between objects, and [[Zol]] itself. This is ever-present, but objects can be cut of from it partially, or entirely by skilled arcanists. This energy can be synthesized, manipulated, or nullified for interesting results.\n\t\t\t- Magnetic\n\t\t\t\t- Energy that gathers around, and interacts with metal. This is theorized to be responsible for the opportunity of [[Iron Light]].\n\t\t\t- Raw\n\t\t\t\t- [[Zol]] was essentially made from an endless well of power. When it was bound by [[The First Tongue]], much of it was turned into the world is understood to be. What wasn't changed is still present. This is Raw Energy, and it can still be harnessed. This is the most abundant form of energy.\n\t\t\t- Elemental\n\t\t\t\t- Within [[Zol]], there are certain substances or reactions that give off a unique energy which can be harnessed by arcanists. These elemental forces are:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Fire\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: burning oil\n\t\t\t\t\t- Frost\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: a blizzard\n\t\t\t\t\t- Lightning\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: static generated by rubbing wool against itself\n\t\t\t\t\t- Necrosis\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: rotting fruit\n\t\t\t\t\t- Radiance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: refined gold\n\t\t\t\t\t- Poison\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: death-cap mushrooms\n\t\t\t\t\t- Acid\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Example: citrus\n\t\t\t- Cognitive\n\t\t\t\t- All minds emit and accept cognitive energy. This energy is extremely complex and difficult to understand or interfere with. A skilled arcanist can use this to communicate, create illusions, hurt, and even read minds.\n\t\t\t\t- Some academics believe this to be a subsection of Informational Energy.\n\t\t\t- Informational\n\t\t\t\t- All things emit a unique wavelength of energy based on the nature of their existence in [[Zol]] as a product of [[The First Tongue]]. This wavelength can be observed and translated into usable information in many different ways. \n\t\t- **Shifting states**\n\t\t\t- Changing a node's state to another varies in difficulty, but can be the most useful trick for an arcanist if done correctly. This practice is far out of reach for a beginner [[caster]], but is thought to be what makes an individual into a true arcanist.\n\t\t\t- Space can be turned to massive amounts of energy, the light of a candle can be used to form a suit of armor made from ice, an arrow flying for ones throat can be turned into harmless wind.\n\t\t\t- Nodes changed eventually return to [[The Ethos]] to  revert back to their original state decided upon by [[The First Tongue]]. The amount of time before this reversion is based on the intention and skill of the [[Caster]]. Once they return to their state they rejoin the planes to undergo this lifecycle again.\n\n![[space matter and energy.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Spell":{"title":"","content":"# Spells\nA [[Spell]] is a repeatable method of harnessing [[Magic]] known to a caster.

To acquire this ability from the ground up, one must initially form the neural pathways to do so. This is done by very particular cognitive exercises such as:\n\t- Convincing ones self that a dropped object with fall upwards, then downwards, then to not fall at all. Then trying to convince ones self that combinations of these will happen simultaneously.\n\t- Sitting inside a warm room at a window with cold weather outside.

It operations on the principal of Likeness.\n-  A simple example of the usage of [[sympathy]] would be a [[caster]] with 2 copper coins on a table. The coins are in no way magical, but if the [[caster]] convinces a part of their brain beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are the exact same coin, they become sympathetically bonded. The [[caster]] can now convince an separate part of their brain in the same way that if one coin moves, the other will move as well. These 2 parts of the brain need to be entirely separated, almost as if they were separate minds on their own. This is called [[Splitting]]. When done successfully, any force applied to one coin affects both coins.\n\t- If you were to lift this coin, you would feel that it weighs a little more than double its normal weight. This is because overall the coins are about 98% alike. They are the same material, shape, and carry the same significance. This is the principal of Likeness. In actuality, the coin would weigh slightly more than double, as [[Sympathetic bonds]] are imperfect.\n\t- One could also split their mind to bond them thermally. Tossing one coin in the fire would cause the other to glow red with heat sympathetically.\n\t\t- Other more complicated bonds could be formed. For instance, a feather of a raven could be used to hunt a partridge by snapping the birds neck. This is however extremely inefficient as they are only about 20% alike at best, and would require a great deal of [[Splitting]] and [[energy]].\n\t\t- Academic [[Arcana]] is based on finding very efficient, practical, and replicable bonds to create a [[Spell]].\n\t- The usage of these bonds in an ad hoc manner is sometimes referred to as prestidigitation.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Tarot-Ring-Bearers":{"title":"","content":"Those who posses one or many of [[The Rings of Tarot]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.709909777Z","tags":null},"/Tellab-the-Wise":{"title":"","content":"# Tellab, The Wise\n*Zolaen God of Wisdom, Major Deity*\n![[Telab The Wise.png]]\n\nHe who understands all and seeks for others to wield the same.

Located in [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], the sake of its nickname comes from the topography which the city rests upon. A set of wide rifts which house a unique geological phenomenon called [[Rift Iron]], a valuable metal that regrows slowly after being mined. It is used to make objects that can reform after breaking.\n\n![[tenzentak.png]]\n\nThis natural resource gives Tenzentak a stable economy, and hopeful future. Unfortunately, it also produces a toxic off-gas called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has developed powerful [[Iron Light]] air filters that utilize light from [[The Sun]] to clean the air. This ensures the city above the rifts remains clean and beautiful, but leaves those who live in the rifts to suffer.\n\nAt the cities eastern edge lies [[The Grand Nothing]], and [[Gilligan's Lift]] which is controlled by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].\n\n## Overview\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | Built on the edge of [[The Grand Nothing]], the city is full of people who seek to explore its wonder and seek out the mysteries of [[Zol]]'s past. The best parts of the city have a sense of wonder and hopefulness.|\n| Main Challenge | As many of the more fortunate have their sights set on venturing into [[The Grand Nothing]], resources are frequently poorly attributed. Leaving those who are less fortunate to scrape by. |\n| Export |  [[Rift Iron]] |\n| Climate | Temperate/Dry |\n| Cuisine | Spicy Entrees, Flatbreads, Spiced Fruits, Game Foul |\n| Size | Large |\n| City Leader | Lady Helseena Trodak |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common, Dwarvish |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Built on the literal edge of the cliffs, thousands of feet above [[The Grand Nothing]]. The City economy is built around the export of [[Rift Iron]] which is mined from crevasses in the city's center |\n| Architecture | Round stone buildings featuring many columns and arches to buffet the high winds. Large round windows decorated with cast iron filigree, red sheet metal rooves, and many balconies decorate its wealthy districts. Its rifts are filled with ramshackle slums populated by the poorest classes who work in the mines. |\n| Color(s) | White and Red |\n| Symbolism | An arched bridge with a sun above in the sky. Below the bridge is a symmetrical pickaxe. |\n| Defenses | High defensible walls, Eastern facing ballista set to take down airship attacks, and the Tenzentak Garrison (provided by [[The Bladehammer Guild]]) equipped with mediocre rift iron gear that provides an above average level of defense. |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| Nobleborn | Social Class | The nobility of the city are those highly associated with trade, government, and passage to [[The Grand Nothing]] |\n| Midborn | Social Class | Those who have run-of-the-mill jobs. Living in the lower city and in its [[Gate Town]]. |\n| Lowborn | Social Class | Those who live in the slums of the rifts. The sick, addicted, uneducated, or just plain unlucky. Working poor paying jobs related to the mines, or begging for scraps. Many Lowborn suffer from afflictions caused by [[Rift Smog]] |\n| [[The Bladehammer Guild]] | Guild | A massive guild that controls [[Gilligan's Lift]]. The Guild operates all over eastern [[Zol]]. It is made up of many subgroups, all with unique goals that support overarching dream of the whole guild: 'Create a better [[Zol]]' |\n| The Unhealed Dagger | Criminal | The overarching term for the diverse criminal nexus that operates in the depth of the city's rifts. There is no sole leading party, the name merely sums up the group as a whole. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | Riftkeep | Keep | The city's main keep |\n | Rift-Top Square | Market | The highest quality and prices you will find for all your general needs in the city. It contains a multitude of permanent shops and a handful of semi-permanent stands. Located at the intersection of Faultline and the Northroad. |\n | The Narrowmarket | Market | The slum market within the rifts themselves. A fast-paced and seedy bazaar packed into tight quarters. |\n | Albojo's Wares | Magic Shop | The sole magic shop in the city. A high class establishment located in the Rift-Top Square. Run by the snooty Tabaxi Albojo Albojo II. |\n | The View | Tavern | A large and popular tavern for the middle class located on the cliff's edge in Smogtown. Run by a soft-spoken Dwarf man called Kalb Rike. |\n | Immarum | Tavern | A high class drinking and dining establishment for the nobility. Located in the Rift-Top Square. |\n | The Pit | Tavern | Located in the depths of the central Rift, The Pit is has a reputation of being a strange bar filled with shady patrons. Known for its uneven floors caused by the regrowing [[Rift Iron]] veins in the stone below. Run by a one eyed Ogre called 'Runt'. |\n | The Sheathe-Anvil Tavern | Tavern | [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s private tavern, reserved for guild members. Located within the guild campus. |\n | [[The Bladehammer Guild]] | Guild | The largest operating guild in all of [[Zol]], headquartered in [[Tenzentak]]. The guild is a place for any gifted individual to find work, or for any in need to hire help. The Guild provides a vast number of services like mercenaries, craftsmen, academics, and healers. |\n | Tenzentak Station | Train Station | The city's connection to [[The Great Tracks]]. Located at the cities furthest reaches along the Northroad. |\n | Tenzentak Convergence | Teleportation Circle | The city's primary teleportation circle, located in the Riftkeep |\n | Bladehammer Convergence | Teleportation Circle | [[The Bladehammer Guild]]'s teleportation circle, located within the guild campus |\n | [[Gilligan's Lift]] | Misc | A wonderous feat of engineering. Gilligan's Lift is a giant elevator-like contraption that brings personnel, resources, and equipment from the city down to the surface of [[The Grand Nothing]]. Its operation is overseen by [[The Bladehammer Guild]].|\n\n## Authority\nThe city is led by Lady Helseena Trodak, the [[Alderian Seat]] of [[Tenzentak]]. Her rule (in her own words) is one of 'balance'. [[Tenzentak]] faces unique challenges being the hub of outreach into [[The Grand Nothing]]. \n\nLady Trodak seeks to maintain the economy to support the efforts of those who venture out into [[The Grand Nothing]]. In doing so she requires the export of [[Rift Iron]]. Unfortunately the mining and refinement of the material is the source of many of the city's issues. \n\n[[The Bladehammer Guild]] provides the Tenzentak Garrison, one of the guilds many subgroups, in exchange for much of its funding and tax exemption. This garrison acts as the city's guard, or army in times of war.\n\nThe authority of Lady Trodak wavers the deeper in the rift you go. The lowborn people mostly live by their own rules and codes, only occasionally being harassed by the garrison.\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\nIn its current day an age, the city is the most accessible means for one to venture into [[The Grand Nothing]]. Many travel here to seek out the treasures hidden in the ruins of the old world.\n\nIt is also home to the headquarters of [[The Bladehammer Guild]]. The guild is the largest operating party of mercenaries, scholars, craftsmen, and politicians. The guild is made up of many subgroups that have legitimacy all over [[Zol]]. Those who take up arms with the guild are given the agency to do much in the kingdoms of The Three Corners of Civilization.\n\n## Historical Importance\n[[Tenzentak]] was one of the first cities to be founded in [[Zol]]. Its location on the cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]] was instrumental in [[The Dragon War]]. This was due to the strong up drafting winds that rise from the cliff. These gusts made for difficult sustained airborne combat for dragons.\n\nIts defensible location also caused it to be the last of the Human cities to fall in the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Rebels were able to finally take the city by sending squads of soldiers to climb laterally along the cliffs edge and sabotage the cities defenses during the night.\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- The natural regrowth of [[Rift Iron]] creates toxic off-gassing called [[Rift Smog]]. The city has created filters powered by sunlight that cleanse the air for the upper city. However those who live in the rifts have to wear face coverings and often have health complications.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.713909792Z","tags":null},"/The-Alktree-Haven":{"title":"","content":"# The Alktree Haven\nOne of [[Zol]]'s  [[Religious Organizations]]. [[The Alktree Haven]], is located on the southeast border of [[The Witchlands]] near [[Viscera]]. It is meant as a place for anyone of any belief to congregate. Within the safe-haven individuals can enjoy open-minded discussion, art, philosophical debate, sermons, and lectures.\n\n## Values (Neutral Good)\n*\"A place where any person, of any creed, can come to eat, drink, and think freely\"*\n\nAbove all else [[The Alktree Haven]] values peace, and the celebration of individuality. Its reputation is known all across [[Zol]] despite its small size. It is known as a place where anyone can seek refuge, knowledge and companions. So long as you bring good intentions to the tree, you will be met with open arms. \n\n## Origin\nThe haven began as a place of refuge during the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. Many who did not want to fight fled into the dangerous [[The Witchlands]]. So many of these people, driven from their homes, were lost to the dangers of the wilds. However, a small few discovered the haven guarded by a [[magic]] tree that warded off monsters.\n\nIt became a home for many, shared experiences amongst its residents drove them to aid anyone who needed it. Slowly but surely it grew in size and reputation. Its was given the name of a lost friend who had died protecting its grounds from bandits.\n\n## Structure\nThe haven has few rules and a very loose hierarchy.\n- ### Leadership\n\t- Two individuals act as the head of the organization. [[Hal Draen]] a soft spoken, old and powerful druid, and the eccentric [[Poldan Rike]] a gifted sorcerer. These two are well respected by many-a-traveler.\n- ### Size\n\t- The haven itself does not have any formal membership, but at any given time there are typically a few hundred people on its grounds at any given time. There are however a few thousand who have considered it a home at some point in their life.\n- ### Rules\n\t- All violence (verbal or physical), discriminatory behavior, and nationalism is banned within the grounds of [[The Alktree Haven]]. Violation of these rules results in banishment from the grounds, further infraction results in execution. This violence is only allowed when done in defense of the Alktree.\n- ### Symbolism\n\t- A white mangrove tree on blue backing\n\n## Assets\n- The Alktree itself is a colossal mangrove tree with a hollow interior. The void within the tree has been filled with a large structure that is used by those who reside in the haven. The grounds around the tree contain a small village, all of which is considered the domain of the haven.\n- The haven has no formal defenses, but the tree itself magically wards off monsters\n- In times of bloodshed, any members capable of fighting would lay down their life to protect the haven.\n- Everything within the haven is given freely. Food, shelter, medicine, knowledge, and tools.\n\n## Relationships\n- The nearby nations respect the sanctity of [[The Alktree Haven]], but in past times there have been instances of bounty hunters causing a stir in search of their mark.\n- Many powerful witches of [[The Witchlands]] have sworn to protect it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.713909792Z","tags":null},"/The-Apex":{"title":"","content":"See [[The Convergences]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.713909792Z","tags":null},"/The-Astral-Sea":{"title":"","content":"See [[The Ethos]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.713909792Z","tags":null},"/The-Awakening":{"title":"","content":"# The Awakening\nA term used for the recorded explanations by the earliest people who were transported to the Three Corners of Civilization and had their memories taken during [[The Undoing]].\n\nThere are no recorded first hand accounts from [[The Awakening]].

The landscape that was home to the ancient people of [[Zol]] was struck with a force so destructive it demolished nearly everything, reducing it to dust and ruins.

The Plane of Immolation is what gives the heat of flame and the radiant light to [[Zol]].\n\n![[immolation.png]]\n\nRumors of a city of flame within Immolation exist, but due to its harsh environment there is little information.\n\n[[The Sun]] is an ever moving portal that passes through sky leading to Immolation.\n\n## The Plane of Temperament\nRock, sand, metal, soil and gemstone. The foundation of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It is said that The Plane of Temperament is accessible by taking long lateral journeys through [[The Underdark]]. Supposedly it is difficult to judge when one enters or exits Temperament as it manifests as a ever spanning series of caverns.\n\n![[Temperment.png]]\n\nPopulations of Dangerous [[Giants]] and great chitinous beasts reside in Temperament, some of which even have their own cities.\n\n\n## The Plane of Tempest\nThe sky itself. The Plane of Tempest is the most vast and peaceful of [[The Elemental Planes]]. It provides the [[Prime Material Plane]] with life-sustaining oxygen.\n\nIt can be accessed via long lateral journeys in the sky. It contains many avian species who travel freely between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and Tempest.\n\n![[Tempest.png]]\n\nTempest contains no landmasses, but does house many large beings known as Buoyants. These beings appear like a mix between a whale and a large balloon, and act as a resting place for flying creatures who need it. Large Buoyants even have forests growing on their backs.

This language is what binds [[The Trinity]] into all of existence within Zol. It is referred to as a language for lack of a better term. Unlike modern language, The First Tongue must be spoken with more than just words and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The First Tongue must be spoken with uncontested knowledge, unbound emotion, iron will, perfect artistry, exact movement, unwavering faith, and a [[Vizir]] like no other. The words of The First Tongue are so complex they cannot be recorded in any useful manner of writing.\n\nThe First Tongue is thought to be a collection of names an rules for all things in [[Zol]]. As a result it is a broad language, but is theorized to have limits in this way. It is generally accepted that the only being to know the full span of The First Tongue is [[The Watcher in The Door]]. Despite the omnipotence this would give a being, his scripture claims he does not utilize this power as it would be unjust. This sparks debate among scholars and theologians.\n\n## Relation to The Old Tongue\nThe First Tongue is the predecessor of [[The Old Tongue]], and is much more powerful. An individual who knows a word from The First Tongue has full dominion over that element of [[Zol]]. This grants [[Magic]] power akin to that of a god. Acquiring a word from The First Tongue is arguably the single most difficult thing one can achieve as an individual in [[Zol]].\n\n## Discovery and Possession\nLittle is known about how to actually acquire a word from The First Tongue, and those who do know keep it a well guarded secret. It is thought that before [[The Undoing]], there were many who possessed words. In modern times, there are only 5 publicly known individuals who possess a word. They go by the title of [[Wordbearers]]. Rumors and legends tell of many more than 5, but that remains to be proven.\n\nDiscovering a word in The First Tongue is said to feel like witnessing the whole universe itself for a single moment. A second spans into an eternity and the truths held behind the word you have discovered come as no surprise to you, as you are its champion. It instead come as a comfort, a tool for you to shape [[Zol]] like no other.\n\nOne the major differences The First Tongue has over [[The Old Tongue]] is words from The First Tongue can be passed down to a worthy apprentice. This requires that the apprentice has studied for a lifetime under the [[Wordbearers]], and has a mastery over the subject beaten only by their master Word Bearer. This allows for individuals to complete a challenge far less great than discovering a word on their own. The word is passed upon death given the Wordbearer wills it so, and the candidate is worthy.\n\nThis has allowed some words to stay amongst the population for many generations, and has defined history in many ways. The words publicly known and available in the modern world are:\n- [[The Word of Fire]]\n- [[The Word of Shadow]]\n- [[The Word of Iron]]\n- [[The Word of Rage]]\n- [[The Word of Growth]]\n- [[The Word of Storms]]\n\nThere has never been a record of an individual possessing more than one word, nor 2 individuals possessing the same word. It is suspected this is a principal of The First Tongue, but it also may just be a product of its rarity.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.725909837Z","tags":null},"/The-Forgotten-Heavens":{"title":"","content":"# The Forgotten Heavens\n*One of Zol's [[Planes]] of existence*\n\nHome to [[The Night Empress]], [[The Forgotten Heavens]] is a landscape of old overgrown ruins and a sky full of shooting stars.\n\n![[The Forgotten Heavens.png]]\n\nIt is thought that spending prolonged time in [[The Forgotten Heavens]] will eventually reveal hidden truths about ones past.\n\nThe realm is largely vacant, but from time to time the unclaimed souls of children can be seen playing in the gardens and streams.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.725909837Z","tags":null},"/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun":{"title":"","content":"# The Free Cities of Alderun\nThe Free Cities of Alderun are comprised of 7 Cities.

Despite its difficult past, Alderun now flourishes with life and culture. A land where anyone can choose to be who they want, but with great freedom comes discourse.\n\n## Historical Summary\nDuring the [[First Age]], [[Human Sovereigntists]] claimed that the Off-Humans must follow a strict set or laws, or face slavery. The [[Humans]] of Kapesh enforced themselves as 'higher beings' over the [[Off-Human]] races. The oppressed people were forced to undergo dark experiments. These tests were intended to discover a way to restore the [[Great Magic]] of the humans by recombining the Off-Humans with their once hosts. The humans were understandably met with resistance.\n\nRebellions against the humans rose and fell. The true overturning of South Kapesh was not until [[Eirmond the Brave]] rose to glory. Eirmond was a stellar fighter, and a great leader to the Off-Human People.  A [[Half-Orc]] man, born in [[Ka'thoor]]. He won Alderun, city-by-city, a civil war that is now known as the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\nAlderun is now lead by the [[Alderian Council]], a democratically elected board of individuals with a representative from each city.\n\nAlderun also borders [[The Grand Nothing]], it has two [[Great Lifts]]. One in [[Tenzentak]], and the other in [[Holocene]].\n\n## The Alderian Wilds\nDiverse like no other region, The Alderian wilds contain a menagerie of animals, plants, and monsters that differ wildly as one travels from [[Zessgorn]] to [[Holocene]].\n\nThe regions diversity gives much opportunity to its people, but its monsters cause for many problems. The Cities of Alderun spend much of their resources focusing on inner workings of their urban centers. This leaves the wilds an untamed and lawless place.\n\nCriminals and monsters roam the remote places of Alderun. While not as dangerous as its western neighbor, [[Kapesh]]. One would not want to be caught off the safe path in these wilds.\n\nGeographical features vary from gorgeous coast lines, rolling hills, spanning rivers, large lakes, and the ever strange cliffs of [[The Grand Nothing]].\n\nThe Free Cities of Alderun also contain the mountain ranges:\n- [[The Fetterpeak Mountains]]\n- [[Stormwall]]\n\nThe Free Cities of Alderun has coasts on:\n- [[The Vast Sea]]\n- [[The North Sea]]\n\nThe Free Cities of Alderun border:\n- [[Kapesh]]\n- [[The Ward]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.733909867Z","tags":null},"/The-Glassius-Reach":{"title":"","content":"All that remains of The Glassius Reach are 2 cities\n- [[Corinth]]\n- [[Yorn et Gaul]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.733909867Z","tags":null},"/The-Great-Tracks":{"title":"","content":"# The Great Tracks\n*What unites us*\n![[The Great Tracks.png]]\n## Construction\nThe Great Tracks are a wonderous feat of engineering.

A complex combination of [[Iron Light]] and infrastructure that spans The Three Corners of Civilization. A network of [[Trains]] that allows for anyone, powerful or not, to cross [[Zol]].\n\nOriginally conceptualized for the purpose of unifying the people of [[Zol]]. Allowing for common folk to cross the too-dangerous wilds with ease. This vision was met with resistance from the more conservative members of society. However, even they could not deny the immense economical benefits it would create.\n\nThe design and production of engines was given to the city of [[Rails]] due to its central location. The cities name becoming the nickname for the tracks the [[Trains]] ran on. Their blueprints coming from [[Artificers]] from [[Kerketh Academy]].\n\nDroves of workers and garrisons had to perform long and drawn out missions to construct railways between cities. Monsters and beasts of the wilds would attack the workers daily. The only reason so many did the labor was the high wages for rail workers and security detail.\n\n## Modern Function\nIn the current day and age, the [[Trains]] are integral to society. Moving exports and passengers of all types. They move at such high velocity any creature or structure in their path is obliterated.\n\nRunning on the power of [[Nodes]] in a state of [[Space]], drawing them in at the nose of the train and converting them into motion. The operation of the complex [[Apparatum]] is performed by a conductor.\n\nThere is a monetary cost for using the [[Trains]], either as a passenger or using them for transporting goods. In either case, there is a spectrum of services all at different costs. This allows for even the less fortunate to use [[The Great Tracks]] if they are able to save for it.\n\nThe [[Trains]] move hundreds of cars long night and day. In almost all cases the tracks run outside of a cities walls, stopping at a local station. Their incoming is felt as rumbling earth, and a distinct, low hum.\n\n## Notable Exceptions\nSome cities, or kingdoms do not use [[The Great Tracks]]. Be it religious beliefs, geographical location, or cultural differences.\n- [[The Ward]] does not use [[The Great Tracks]] because of their disallowance of [[Apparatum]] for religious reasons.\n- [[The Glassius Reach]] is not included in [[The Great Tracks]] due to political differences and recent war.\n- [[Gethsemane]] only has a single train station in [[Mod Dranor]]. This is largely because of Xenophobia.\n- [[Heliodor]] has a station nearby located on the ground where individuals can take [[Airships]] to the city.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.733909867Z","tags":null},"/The-Hooded-Presence":{"title":"","content":"# The Hooded Presence\n*Wayward God of Shadows, Minor Deity*\n![[The hooded presence.png]]\n\nThe [[Fell]] god of deception, espionage, and trickery.

It apparently has immense value amongst [[The Cosmos]].\n\nThe [[Illithids]] took [[Stigmata]] as their base of operations, and converted many [[Humans]] to [[Illithids]]. These new [[Illithids]] were originally subservient to the invaders, but their human stubbornness resurfaced in their personality over time.\n\nBecause of this, the [[Illithids]] faced a great deal of in-fighting and discordance amongst their ranks.

These souls are selected at random by [[The Mortal Coil]] to be bound to vessels. This binding begins Life.\n\t- Souls in this state are thought to be non-sentient, and only become true beings when they are bound to a vessel.\n\t\t- This is not the case for souls that are sent for rebirth after death. In this scenario, the souls-to-be-reborn are considered comatose, living beings. \n- Life\n\t- Life begins when a vessel is fully created and a soul is bound to it. This can manifest in a number of ways\n\t\t- Successfully completed reproduction\n\t\t\t- A soul is only attached when a reproductive creature fully forms a child that successfully hatches, or is birthed\n\t\t- Homunculum\n\t\t\t- The creation of an artificial vessel fit enough for a soul to enter it\n\t\t\t- This can manifest in many ways\n\t\t\t\t- A clone of a being is made via magic\n\t\t\t\t- elemental forces are bent to house a soul\n\t\t\t\t- [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]]\n\t\t\t\t\t- A newly discovered method of creating life where a complex enough creation of [[Iron Light]] is made and it becomes sentient.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is how beings like [[Warforged]] come to life\n\t\t- Divine Creation\n\t\t\t- When one of the [[Gods]] directly uses their power to create a vessel and injects a soul into it\n\t\t- Natural Spawn\n\t\t\t- When the natural world of [[Zol]] produces a being on its own\n\t- Life cannot begin on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, except for the case of Divine Creation where a powerful enough god manually seeks out a soul for the vessel.\n- Death\n\t- Death occurs when enough damage afflicts the system that maintains life. This can appear as\n\t\t- Damage to the vessel so great it cannot sustain a soul\n\t\t- Damage to the bond between a vessel and soul so great it causes them to separate\n\t\t- Damage to the soul so great it destroys the soul\n\t\t\t- This is the rarest death, as the soul is nigh indestructible. If this occurs there is no way to bring the being back to life.\n\t- If Death does occur, there are cases where magic can be used to restore life, given that the circumstances are correct.\n\t\t- If one does successfully restore life, the being will return with a scar from [[The Mortal Coil]] called a Mortality Rune ![[Mortality Runes.png]]\n\t- Death cannot occur on a plane where [[The Mortal Coil]] is not present, save for the case of a soul being destroyed. A death off the mortal coils usually results in banishment to [[The Ethos]], [[The Void]], the [[Prime Material Plane]], or the plane from which they originated. They arrive on the brink of death. \n\t  \n\t  This is not always the case as some planes like [[Absurdia]] have their own rules about death off [[The Mortal Coil]].\n\t\t- Any living thing can die so long as it is under the effect of [[The Mortal Coil]]\n\t\t- Something that is defined as ***Immortal*** is not killed by old age, and can withstand colossal amounts of trauma to their vessel, soul, and the bond between them without succumbing to death.\n\t\t\t- This principal is why the [[Gods]] spend most of their time outside of [[The Mortal Coil]], as it gives them much security from other powerful beings who would see them dead.\n- Afterlife\n\t- When death occurs, the soul (if intact) leaves the vessel. It is then guided by [[The Coilwalker]] to a new phase of existence based on the way the soul acted in its lifetime.\n\t- The paths a soul can take are:\n\t\t- Rest\n\t\t\t- If one of the [[Gods]] takes a liking to a given soul, the may be brought to stay with them outside [[The Mortal Coil]]. A peaceful eternity amongst kindred spirits.\n\t\t\t- If no god claims it, and the soul is unfit for rebirth or punishment. It is sent to [[Apolyatum]].\n\t\t- Rebirth\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth are sent back into [[The Ethos]] for their soul to be randomly selected for life again. If this occurs they are reborn with small slivers of their past lives interwoven into their being.\n\t\t\t- Slivers of past lives stay with souls, but are largely born without an sense of past life.\n\t\t\t\t- [[Magic]] investigation can expose truths about past lives.\n\t\t\t- Many things can spark rebirth. Magical influence, the will of a god, or even if the soul itself truly seeks it.\n\t\t\t- Beings who undergo rebirth many times often go on to do great things.\n\t\t- [[Limbo]]\n\t\t\t- If [[The Coilwalker]] is not able to determine the fate of a soul, they are sent to limbo to undergo some trial.\n\t\t\t\t- Each trial varies for each soul\n\t\t\t\t- Some trials involve that of moral dilemma, combat, challenge of wit, or constitution\n\t\t\t\t- The result of a trial determines what the soul is worthy of in death\n\t\t- Punishment\n\t\t\t- If a soul has led a dark life, [[The Coilwalker]] brings it to [[Damnation]] upon death.\n\t\t\t- It is thought that [[The Coilwalker]] struck an accord with [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. This deal allows for [[Aldem, King of all Hells]] to claim some form of power from the deaths of [[Zol]]. In exchange he is to carry out the punishment for souls marked by [[The Coilwalker]].\n\t\t\t- Punishment varies in severity. Sometimes it is a light and temporary punishment like manual labor for a few hundred years. After which the damned are allowed to reside in [[Apolyatum]], the highest layer of [[Damnation]], the city of the dead.\n\t\t\t\t- Other times it is a more severe, and eternal punishment\n\t\t- [[Obliteration]]\n\t\t\t- If a soul is deemed too dangerous for [[Zol]], [[The Coilwalker]] will send a soul to the lowest layer of [[Damnation]]. A small and dark place called [[Obliteration]]. Here, giant beings made from obsidian destroy the souls sent to them with mighty hammers forged by Aldem himself.\n\n## Anti-Life\nOccasionally a powerful vessel or soul will exist without its bonded counterpart, and will somehow continue to function in a strange manner akin to Life. There are likely many things that can cause this, but few are known:\n- [[Magical Backfire]]\n- The will of one of the [[Gods]]\n- [[Necromancy]]\n\nThe result is a physical being who acts in one of two ways\n- Echoes\n\t- This occurs when a being survives having its soul severed, and no further will is imposed on it beyond the initial severing\n\t- The resulting being will attempt to continue their \"life\", but they do so without all of their emotions or memories in tact, resulting in strange behavior. Sometimes the physical body of this creature will also become monstrous in appearance.\n\t- Anti-life is reversible for Echoes if a soul can be rebound to its vessel, returning the being to normal Life again.\n- Undead\n\t- Vessels who have fully died, then given an artificial soul fabricated via [[Necromancy]].\n\t- This creates a being subservient to the will of its souls creator\n\t- The strength of the resulting being is dependent on the state of the vessel, and the skill of the souls creator.\n\t- These beings are typically more susceptible to further deaths as the bond between vessel and soul is not perfect.\n\t\t- But the severed artificial soul can be easily reattached and sometimes will do so on its own.\n\nBeings who experience Anti-Life are immortal by the rules of [[The Mortal Coil]] as they do not age and have greatly increased fortitude in many cases. A [[Lich]] is a being who does this to themselves intentionally, usually to gain immortality and pursue the dark side of [[Arcana]].\n\n\n## The Mortal Realms\n[[Zol]] has many [[Planes]] of existence that are all anchored to the [[Prime Material Plane]]. [[The Mortal Coil]]'s influence does not exist in all [[Planes]]. This has an interesting effect on the behavior of life, death, and gods on any plane.\n\nThe [[Planes]] that contain [[The Mortal Coil]] are known as The Mortal Realms:\n- The [[Prime Material Plane]]\n- The [[Fey]]\n- The [[Fell]]\n- [[The Ethos]]\n- [[The Elemental Planes]]\n\nDue to this fact, most [[Gods]] rarely enter these [[Planes]] themselves. When they do, they put their life at great risk.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.757909958Z","tags":null},"/The-Night-Empress":{"title":"","content":"# The Night Empress\n*Zolaen God of Night and The Moons, Major Deity*\n![[The Night Empress.png]]\n\nKnown for their mystery and matronly nature, [[The Night Empress]] is the cryptic mother of the [[Zolaen Gods]].

Similar to its parent, The Old Tongue is for lack of a better term, a language. Unlike modern language, The Old Tongue must be spoken with more than just words, and often involves no words at all.\n\nAs an example, the modern language of [[Common]] must be spoken with the correct pronunciation, grammar, inflection, cadence, et cetera. The Old Tongue must be spoken with knowledge, emotion, will, artistry, movement, faith, and a strong [[Vizir]]. There are words in The Old Tongue, but they are fathoms more complicated than a mere dialect.\n\nThe Old Tongue can be used to harness great [[Magic]] via access to [[The Wills]]. Those who know even a small fragment of it are called [[Speakers]]. Access to this power is rare in [[Zol]], most people encounter only a single Speaker in their lives.\n\n## Usage and Learning\nBinding [[The Wills]] with the power of The Old Tongue is a step above binding them with one's [[Vizir]]. While the former requires great focus, and convincing ones mind of a reality different than that of what is occurring around them, The Old Tongues feels more akin to that of fairy tale magic. Rather than forcing ones will to bleed out into reality, reality naturally bends to fit to ones will. Almost as if it is doing what it is told. It is theorized The Old Tongue temporarily re-binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] itself.\n\nLearning The Old Tongue in any capacity changes a person. From their emotions to their very brain structure and physiology. Especially in the case of [[Arcana]]. Many who study in this field lose themselves to madness. Any being that possesses a Vizir may learn The Old Tongue.\n\nAdditionally, learning The Old Tongue does not come from books or lessons like other language. An individual must discover pieces of it on their own, almost like rediscovering forgotten memories. Great practice with one's [[Vizir]] is known to increase the likelihood of discovery. It is found by great willpower, dedication, craft, study, acts of heroism, and even traumatic experiences on occasion. Every individual uses it in a manner unique to them.\n\nNo one person knows the entirety of The Old Tongue, and it is theorized to be boundless. It is only referred to as a language as many [[Speakers]] have described it as such. Due to its nature it is very hard to record. Some [[Speakers]] have tried to make records, and collections of it, but they are kept very secretively. A runic language called [[Ralldung]] was developed for this purpose. \n\nMany also do not wish to share their secrets, as the power takes much to wield, and could do wrong in unprepared hands. Others merely do not want the unworthy to benefit from their hard work.\n\n## Individual Experience\nMany individuals describe their first experience with the Old Tongue as something unlike anything else. It brings you into a state where you feel for first the first time in your life, you are existing fully. A euphoric feeling is said to flood your mind. Your senses and emotions amplify to new heights. Colors are seen in their true forms, the edges of solid objects appear more defined. The air itself is said to feel like a sea flowing all around you, where all movement sends waves that can be felt all across your being. It has been called a 'drug like no other' by some. \n\nEvery account of it has these commonalties, but with a unique difference from person to person. Some say they are able to harness magic in a way only possible during the first encounter. Others say they witness events from the past, future, or other worlds. Some even claim to hear the words of the gods, or strange secrets spoken by [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAfter the feeling leaves, may people are left feeling emotional or lost. The feeling never returns with the same intensity. As one masters their craft in The Old Tongues their normal experience of reality begins to grow closer and closer to that of the first time.\n\nIt is believed that knowing something in The Old Tongue is the first step in learning it in [[The First Tongue]], but this is based more on intuition than fact.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n[[Speakers]] are both revered and feared across [[Zol]]. Many people believe they are the ideal of the sapient world, while others claim they are a large problem to be feared and avoided. The sheer amount of myth and legend alone that revolves around speakers is enough for common folk to acquire very opinionated stances on [[Speakers]].\n\nSome [[speakers]] hide their abilities while others wear it with pride. Sporting special jewelry and clothes to denote their status. Some cultures like that of [[Kapesh]] treat speakers as the highest degree of nobility.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.765909988Z","tags":null},"/The-Old-World-of-Zol-Excerpts-from-The-Grand-Nothing":{"title":"","content":"# The Old World of Zol - Excerpts from the Grand Nothing\nA highly controversial text on the archeological discoveries of [[The Grand Nothing]].

They come in great varieties and almost all have destructive intentions.\n\nWithin the subplane of [[Damnation]] resides a similar but distinctly different cast of beings called [[Fiends]]. To an uneducated eye they would seem the same as [[Demons]]. However there is a sole difference that divides them.\n\n[[Fiends]] are beings bound by oath to serve [[Aldem, King of all Hells]]. If they are caught by a greater demon betraying him their souls are instantly destroyed. Most [[Fiends]] are endlessly loyal to Aldem because of this.\n\n[[Demons]] however are not bound to serve a master if they do not choose to. This gives [[Demons]] a sense of pride over fiends that has forged a unique hatred between the 2 groups over many ages.\n\nThe two groups of monsters clash regularly. Mortals have even been known to gain favors from one group when sparring with the other.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.781910048Z","tags":null},"/The-Wandering-Gods":{"title":"","content":"# The Wandering Gods\nA group of powerful cosmic beings, alien to [[Zol]].

They claim to instead be teachers to both [[Gods]] and mortals alike. While this is the reason most of their followers seek their guidance, others believe it is a thinly veiled guise which their true conquest hides behind.\n\nUnlike other [[Gods]], [[The Wandering Gods]] are defined by a moral rather than a domain.

The Wandering Gods are not fit well into this metric as academics are not aware of the extent of their power.\n\nThe Wandering Gods operate with an influence similar to that of Minor deities, but openly resist Major deities. It is not know if these behaviors are caused by limited power, coordination between gods, or oaths sworn. They do not seem to follow the rules most powerful beings do.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.789910078Z","tags":null},"/The-War-of-Lies":{"title":"","content":"See The Destruction of [[Yorn et Gaul]].","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.789910078Z","tags":null},"/The-Ward":{"title":"","content":"The Ward is comprised of 3 cities\n- [[Fike]]\n- [[Hoss]]\n- [[Often]]","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.789910078Z","tags":null},"/The-Wasp-Eater":{"title":"","content":"# The Wasp Eater\n*Void God of Plague, Minor Deity*\n![[The Wasp Eater.png]]\n\nHe who culls, King of Plagues, [[The Wasp Eater]] is a hyper intelligent being who claims to seek the fair destruction of life itself.

Separated by [[The Narrow Sea]], these nations have warred from roughly annum 2600 to 4000. Initially sparked by [[Gethsemane]] enslaving humans who crossed into their territories, and [[Kapesh]] doing the same with [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. [[Kapesh]] offered an exchange of prisoners, which [[Gethsemane]] rejected.\n\nThis rejection sparked conflict between the nations that lasted centauries. It wavered in intensity over the years, and its core motivation changed from enslavement, to expansion, to resources, and finally religious differences. \n\nFew major effects surfaced from the battles. The city of [[Riverbridge]] constantly changed hands due to its location on the border, slaves were eventually traded between sides for their freedom, any many died in the extended conflict. However, the conflict did give a foothold for the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Peak of the Battles\nThe peak occurred during annum 3673. [[Gethsemane]] had sought the aid of a powerful being from [[The Void]] called [[The Maul Bearer]]. A demon of great strength who was to be given any territory he conquered as payment, so long as [[Gethsemane]] kept him unbound from [[The Void]]. The demon and his army destroyed the [[Kapesh]] city of [[Rello Arr]] and its surrounding territory, creating the West Scars.\n\n[[Kapesh]] was able to kill the [[The Maul Bearer]] and his armies before they took [[Kierketholl]], but the attacks left [[Kapesh]] weak for generations. This weakness later gave way to the [[Alderian Rebellion]].\n\n## Information on Slaves during the Battles\nEnslavement of [[Humans]], [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] sparked the initial conflict, and later became a bargaining chip between sides. These slaves began to be treated more as high valued prisoners than slaves, as their value in trades during conflict often outweighed their value as workers.\n\nThey suffered much injustice during these times, but the [[Off-Human]] slaves faced a much darker fate. The ways the nations had to stretch during wartimes depended heavily on the labor of slaves. The greater the stakes of the battle, the greater the mistreatment of [[Off-Human]] slaves. Many recognize this suffering as the greatest of all during the [[Triumvirate Battles]].\n\n## The Triumvirate Concord\nAfter the discovery of [[Mechanicum Immaculatum]] and the creation of [[Warforged]], the [[Triumvirate Battles]] entered a state of fast moving destruction and exhaustion of resources. The machines were so efficient at warfare they expedited the rate at which the conflict occurred. A sort of mutually assured destruction.\n\nThis forced [[The Triumvirate]] to reconsider their disputes. The world had changed so much and it was evident how little [[Zol]] knew about itself. The kingdoms of [[Kapesh]] struck and agreement to stop the conflict, and release all slaves that were [[Humans]], [[Elves]], and [[Dwarves]].\n\nPolitical amicability grew over time, but cultural divide never faded. Still to this day there is great disdain between the people of [[Kapesh]] and [[Gethsemane]].\n\nSince the concord, no major conflicts between kingdoms has arisen.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.837910259Z","tags":null},"/Uroga-Hag-of-the-Sea":{"title":"","content":"# Uroga, Hag of The Sea\n*Void God of Fathoms, Major Deity*\n![[uroga.png]]\n\nQueen of the deep, the most powerful of the mysterious [[Hags]], she who commands the horrors that lurk in the depths of the ocean.

When harnessed, it allows one to access [[The Wills]] in a minor way, granting [[Magic]] power. It is largely thought to be the very essence of ones soul, and can be trained like a muscle.\n\nUtilizing one's Vizir is no simple task and can be very exhausting. It is typically accomplished in one of three ways for each of [[The Wills]] respectively.\n- **Faith**, for [[Observance]]. It requires that one believes in the power of their source, and that they themselves are a worthy candidate for it. Any shred of doubt weakens the channeled power significantly. The closer the bond between [[Caster]] and source, the stronger the [[Magic]]. This belief opens them up so the power of their source can pass through them, and be transformed by their will.\n- **Understanding**, for [[Viridescence]]. It requires one to mentally blur the line between self and nature, and allow for their will to bleed into the surroundings. This allows one to work with nature, or bend it to their will.\n- **Conceptualization**, for [[Arcana]]. The most abstract of the craft. Requiring a user to have a full image of the reality they are trying to create in their mind. It can be done in an infinite amount of ways, but is typically thought of in terms of [[Arcanists]]. \n\t- Take the example of an arcanist using a [[Spell]]. It requires one to visualize [[Sympathetic bonds]] between [[Space, Matter, and Energy]]. These visualizations differ greatly from practice to practice, and even [[Caster]] to caster. These bonds can be relatively simple or immensely complex. For instance, the [[Spell]] Mage Hand (when taught academically) is performed by an arcanist who is visualizing a space near them to be directly connected to their hand, or the part of the mind that controls their hands. Even though the bond is non-existent, they must fully convince themselves of it mentally. On top of that they must utilize another part of their mind to draw [[energy]] from [[The Trinity]] to make the hand move and manipulate objects. This is called [[Splitting]]. Splitting is extremely difficult and gets very complex very quickly. Skilled [[Arcanists]] can split their mind dozens of times for complex spells, convincing themselves of non-existent realities that sometimes even contradict one another.\n\n## Other Methods\nAlternatively to that, other individuals have been known to use entirely unique methods to access any of the three wills. Like use of artistry to conceptualize the effect of a [[Spell]]. Some warriors will use their own blood to infuse their weapons with their [[Vizir]]. Others may not even view what they are doing as magic. Warrior monks will use great focus, breathing, and movement techniques to empower their physical body with Vizir, or [[Ki]] as they call it. Some are known to even surge with [[magic]] in the heat of battle, charged by rage or determination.\n\nThis has lead to intense debate amongst scholars and theologians. Many believe they have the true understanding to the shape of [[Magic]] and [[The Trinity]], but others argue only a sliver of information is known about the true nature of [[Magic]] and [[Zol]] itself.\n\nAnother practice of [[Vizir]] is the utilization of [[Iron Light]]. [[Iron Light]] involves inscribing runes on plates of iron to allow magical power to pass through them. The magic is source by a user's [[Vizir]]. The difference between this and all other aspects of [[Vizir]] is utilization of an object created with [[Iron Light]] requires no magical knowledge.\n\n## Connection to The Old Tongue\nGreat practice with one's [[Vizir]] is thought to lead to discovery of [[The Old Tongue]]. This leads to theories by some scholars that [[The Old Tongue]] binds one's [[Vizir]] to [[The Trinity]] temporarily. Which largely increases magical power, and makes accessing it less exhausting.","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.837910259Z","tags":null},"/Void-Gods":{"title":"","content":"# Void Gods\n*Fear the depth of Zol, for not even the Gods know what true horrors lurk in its void*\n\nThe Dark [[Gods]] who lurk deep, deep beneath [[Zol]] in [[The Void]].

They would put their faith in the concept of fate, drawing from sacred decks called [[Tarot Cards]]. Attempting to read the fates via these cards to determine the best path for their people. During [[The Awakening]], on a day that is now known as [[The Tarot Convergence]], all of these clans were led to the same spot on the same day by the cards. It was there they founded Zessgorn.\n\n![[zessgorn 1.png]]\n\nA set of rings were forged to represent the card, [[The Rings of Tarot]]. The bearers of these rings were meant to act as leaders and protectors of Zessgorn, as avatars of the fates. In recent history they have become a scarce resource people will do dark things for.\n\nZessgorn is a beautiful costal city, it is known for its plethora of colorful tapestries that are strewn all about its city, gorgeous beaches, and [[Skytrack]] that carries passengers from the lower city to the keep.\n\n## Zessgorn's Strange Culture\n[[Zessgorn]] is known for its odd customs. Mainly for its rules regarding [[Zessgorn Cups]]. The people of the city all carry tankards with bottoms marked with [[Ferric Alphabet]] signets to designate their house, social standing, and who's protection they are under.\n\n![[zessgorn 2.png]]\n\n## Origin of Zessgorn's Cups\nBefore [[The Page of Cups]] came top power, [[Zessgorn]] sat in a state of careful balance since the end of [[The Dragon War]]. Even the [[Alderian Rebellion]] did not disrupt its long standing traditions.\n\nThe city operated by relying on the rule of those who bore the Empress and Emperor rings. These rulers, along with the other Herald Ring Bearers oversaw the city. They kept order by the aid of the Empowered Ring Bearers. As generations progressed, rings were passed to chosen successors.\n\nThe Lesser Rings were scattered amongst the common population to ensure the people of the city would never be without their own agency to push back against the ruling powers if they ever abused their own rings.\n\nIt was thought that [[The Page of Cups]] ring had a simple power, it allowed an individual to attune with an above average amount of magical objects. Most people's [[Vizir]] allows them attune to around 3, but the ring added capacity for one or two.\n\nThis changed when [[Rali Trunsarr]] discovered that [[The Page of Cups]] ring allowed her to attune to any number of the lesser rings, she enacted a plan to take the city for herself. She fought, stole, and bought all the lesser rings she could. This granted her strength, skill, luck, and magical powers. The lesser rings, while relatively unremarkable on their own compared to the Empowering rings, had a multiplicative effect. Rali's own personal power rose almost to a level of a [[Wordbearer]].\n\nThis sudden change to the power structure sparked civil war and riots within the city. [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] turned on one another as people tried to seize power or return order. The people of [[Zessgorn]] soon discovered that if one of the [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] kills one of their peers, it destroys the ring of the victim. This only increased tensions. Many rings were destroyed by assassinations or lost by the hands of fleeing [[Tarot Ring Bearers]].\n\nIn the end, the remaining major powers were The Empress Ring Bearer, The Judgement Ring Bearer, The Temperance Ring Bearer, and [[The Page of Cups]]. The bearers of these rings formed three distinct factions of power that settled an agreement to cease the city's fighting. Much tension stayed between these factions despite the agreement. No group played their hand and a divide was formed.\n\nThe common people started joining with these factions, going by the name of 'houses'. All but one of the remaining bearers of the Empowering Rings joined houses as high ranking members. The Hermit Ring Bearer was the sole outlier, they instead united the lowest class of citizens into a house of their own.\n\nIdentification between houses became important as tensions rose. Colors and garments were first used to display one's house membership but they became instrumental for espionage. The House of Cups was the first to implement a true solution to this. [[The Page of Cups]] employed [[Artificers]] to embed [[Ferric Alphabet]] Signets into the bottom of tankards. These allowed for her house to verify identity, membership, and status using magic. Important records, and documentation are created by the special offices amongst the House to audit this information.\n\nThis worked so well for House Cups, that House Hermitage and House Temperance implemented the same strategy. Both for its efficiency and to appeal to [[The Page of Cups]]. Eventually the majority of the city was using this method to conduct business and daily life, so House Empress followed reluctantly.\n\nIn modern day, the houses follow the tradition of succession, save for [[The Page of Cups]] who is immortal by the rules of the mortal coil. In modern day, even the lowliest citizens have their own cup.\n\n\n## Overview\n| Aspect | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Main Opportunity | While governed by the [[Alderian Seat]] on paper, the city follows ancient traditions regarding [[The Rings of Tarot]]. This makes for a city of with multiple people of high, competitive authority given by their possessed ring. People pay allegiance to these [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] in exchange for membership amongst their house. This includes benefits like social status, food, housing, protection, careers, and community. |\n| Main Challenge | The city once operated in a balance of powers for many years after the [[Alderian Rebellion]]. This was until [[The Page of Cups]] discovered a secret to her ring that gave her power far beyond that of her peers. This imbalance sparked disorder and chaos in [[Zessgorn]]. Now the city faces rivalry between houses, crime, and general disorder as [[The Page of Cups]] has essentially taken over as the city's ruler. |\n| Climate | Tropical |\n| Cuisine | Fish, fresh fruits, cheeses, olive oil, spiced bread, and wine |\n| Export | Wine, Fruit, Fish, Textiles, Salt |\n| Size | Large |\n| City Leader | Esartes Hald |\n| Primary Language(s) | Common |\n| Majority Racial Group(s) | None |\n| Majority Religion(s) | Zolaen-Centric |\n\n## Major Features\n| Feature | Description |\n|-|-|\n| Distinguishing Features | Costal, vibrant, and the city's [[Skytrack]] |\n| Architecture | Cycladic, Fabric Canopies |\n| Color(s) | Gold, Maroon and Silver |\n| Symbolism | A ring with an ocean wave in the center |\n| Defenses | Large naval fleet, City garrison, House forces, [[Tarot Ring Bearers]] |\n\n## People Groups\n| Group | Type | Description |\n|-|-|-|\n| House Empress | Tarot House | The house of the [[Alderian Seat]] (the bearer of The Empress Ring of Tarot). This house contains only nobility, conducts their business very formally and by the books. Joining this house is no mere task of simple payment. One must be invited. This house also contains The Ring of Judgement, who's bearer conducts the court of law. |\n| House Cups | Tarot House | The wealthiest and second largest house of [[Zessgorn]]. Headed by [[The Page of Cups]], this house contains people of all social classes. It is the most powerful of the houses and has a reputation for criminal operations. Many view this as the city's true governing power. |\n| House Temperance | Tarot House | The means of production. This house is headed by The bearer of The Temperance Ring of Tarot this house owns the city's dock and is largely made up of working class individuals. This house controls the cities exports. |\n| House Hermitage | Tarot House | The house of the common folk. This house was formed in opposition to the need to join a Tarot House to achieve protection. Led by the bearer of The Hermit Ring of Tarot, this house is made up of the common folk as the house's taxes are by far the smallest. It is a passive house compared to its peers, but largest in numbers. |\n| Herald Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Herald Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people are of the highest standing in [[Zessgorn]]. |\n| Empowering Ring Bearers | Misc. | Individuals who posses one of the Empowering Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people are of high standing in [[Zessgorn]]. Most of which act as lieutenants for their respective houses, save for The Hermit who heads their own house. |\n| Lesser Ring Bearers | Misc. | A defunct group of individuals who possessed one of the Lesser Rings of [[The Rings of Tarot]]. These people were of common standing in [[Zessgorn]]. Originally intended to be pillars of community by usage of their ring, [[The Page of Cups]] now holds all known Lesser Rings. |\n\n## Goods and Services\n | Name | Type | Description |\n |-|-|-|\n | The Tarotkeep | Keep | The city's keep and headquarters of House Empress |\n | House Markets | Market | The 4 house markets located all over the city. Each has their own set of similar services. One can only shop at the market associated with their house membership. Each market reflects the general state of their house well. The Empress Market is neat and high class, the Cups Market is a chaotic bazaar, the Temperance Market is a utilitarian hub of trade, and the Hermitage Market is a humble square of shops. Magical items are difficult to find here as most are typically retained by a house for their power; magic items that are available are typically functional [[Apparatum]]. |\n | The Full Cup | Tavern | A massive tavern, central to a small complex of buildings that act as the headquarters for House Cups. Located in central Cups. |\n | The Hall | Tavern | A Longhouse style tavern attached to a large 4 story building, acts as the headquarters for House Hermitage.

This individual is responsibly for relations with the rest of [[The Free Cities of Alderun]], and protection of the city.\n\nIn reality, the city is now know governed by its four houses:\n- House Empress\n\t- Headed by Lord Esartes Hald\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Empress Ring** - Lord Esartes Hald, a middle aged gnome man\n\t\t- **Judgment Ring** - High Judge Relkar Treddin, an Old conservative dwarven man\n\t\t- **Justice Ring** - Inquisitor Gharn Vendur, a brutal and well trained goliath man. Father to Eldora Vendur\n\t\t- **The Tower Ring** - Lord Captain Eldora Vendur, a fiercely loyal goliath woman. Daughter to Gharn Vendur.\n- House Hermitage\n\t- Headed by The Hermit, aka Thorin Black\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Hermit Ring** - Thorin Black, an old and wise human man\n\t\t- **Death Ring** - Grudge, a massive orc man of few words. A long time friend to The Hermit\n- House Temperance\n\t- Headed by Lady Temperance, aka Yelna Fennik\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Temperance Ring** - Yelna Fennik, an old dragonborn woman of great intelligence\n\t\t- **Chariot Ring** - Hjen Valut, a clever tabaxi woman\n\t\t- **Wheel of Fortune Ring** - Marcus Wanderer, a half-elven, well-mannered man who choses his words carefully, and plays his cards wisely. Brother to Calanir Wanderer\n- House Cups\n\t- Headed by [[The Page of Cups]], aka [[Rali Trunsarr]].\n\t- Contains rings:\n\t\t- **Paige of Cups Ring** - [[Rali Trunsarr]], an elven woman appearing of middle age\n\t\t\t- All known lesser rings\n\t\t- **The Fool Ring** - Calanir Wanderer, a mischievous and slippery human man of extremely quick wit. He constantly gets himself into trouble while simultaneously manipulating all around him. Brother to Marcus Wanderer and seeming romantic partner of [[The Page of Cups]].\n\t\t- **The Sun Ring** - A man who simply goes by the name of 'The Sun'. No one knows their origin. They are mute, and fiercely loyal to [[The Page of Cups]].\n\n### Laws\nThe city subscribes to the [[Alderian Laws]].\n\n## Modern Importance\n[[Zessgorn]] is known to be a problematic city when compared to the other free cities. This is because of the disorganized authority within the city. The [[Alderian Seat]]s of the kingdom constantly pressure Lord Esartes Hald to strike order within his city, as [[The Free Cities of Alderun]] depend on very specific political policies to maintain freedom and justice. [[Zessgorn]]'s reliance on rings damages this balance.\n\nThe relatively new disorder within the city has sparked a movement amongst the modern descendants of [[The Tarot]]. This fringe group determined that their people have strayed too far from the past, and have returned to their ancient nomadic ways.\n\n## Historical Importance\nDuring major historical events like [[The Dragon War]], the [[Beast Ire]] plague, and [[The Illithid Invasion]], Tarot power ring bearers fought as crucial warriors of eastern [[Zol]].\n\n\n## Other Things of Note\n- Being within the city, and being without house membership is known as being *Cupless*. Cupless individuals have a very difficult time finding places to stay,  shop, or eat. These individuals are also typically preyed upon by petty criminals.\n- House membership is typically acquired by paying taxes to one of the houses, or giving some great gift or service to it.\n\t- One can also purchase temporary membership if they are visiting the city.\n- The city's dock is also a hub of pirate trade, but is done covertly to avoid prosecution.\n\t- Whole ships and their crew are all associated under the captain's cup","lastmodified":"2022-10-18T12:33:09.857910335Z","tags":null},"/Zessgorn-Cups":{"title":"","content":"Zessgorn Cups are a social tool utilized in the city of [[Zessgorn]] to determine someone's status and house membership in the cities complex socioeconomic structure.
