While interconnected, these two sides of the city are very different. They are attached by deep pools located throughout the city that bore the whole way through the iceberg, bridging the two sides.

Which is the <a href=/zol/Triton rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Triton>Triton</a> word for &rsquo;those who can drown&rsquo;. In the city&rsquo;s culture success is the only measure. Peoples judge each other on how well they perform in their chosen career or pursuit. How much money does a merchant make? How skilled is an artist? How well sculpted is ones furniture? How many people like their cooking? The list goes on and on. We see similar thought patterns in all cultures, but in Shimmer it is ten-fold. If one can prove themselves skilled, they will be invited to greater festivities, and given more opportunity.

If you do not prove yourself as capable and strong, you may be looked down upon. Its buildings are formed entirely of ice, and most are filled with water.

Over the history of the city, the format of this rulership has gone through many forms. This is typically caused by some violent upheaval of the city, which someone uses to claim power. Sometimes Cowl and Shimmer have their own rulers and operate as different cities, sometimes there is a council of rulers, and sometimes (like the current ruler) there is a sole authority which both cities respect.</p><p>The current ruler is King Mandreg (a mononym), who is a Beastfolk man with a physiology similar to that of a walrus. He originated from Shimmer, but was a powerful warrior in his youth. He was the leader for an unnamed band of mercenaries which he used to gain power during a period of unrest. His success as a leader gained him the respect of Shimmer, and his strength gave him the respect of Cowl. He has ruled over both cities for many years.</p><a href=#laws><h3 id=laws><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Laws</h3></a><p>The city does not have formal laws, but there is an understanding of what can, and cannot be done.
