He spilled his own blood into the lakes and rivers of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>. Those who drank of the waters were granted whispers of power, and strange dreams.</p><p>Some did not notice, or even undergo the effects. Those who did felt a strong urge to follow their new bestial instincts, and abandon their societal bonds. It manifested as pulling sensation to the wilderness. Those who gave in abandoned their old lives to seek the source of this yearning.</p><p>They lived like primal people: hunting, scavenging, and howling under moonlight. The more they gave in, the more they grew in their strength. Bestial blood began to fill their veins. It increased their physical abilities, senses, and furthered the odd dreams.</p><p><a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a> meant for these people to be a legion of strong beings, true to his ways. By his ideals, they could defend themselves with no need for society and laws. Directly experiencing the wonder of nature day in, and day out.</p><p>For a time it was a sort of paradise for these people. The towns and cities they abandoned were left in shock and fear for their vanished loved ones, but it only created mass panic, rather than full blown pandemonium. Though it was not long before the habits of mortals began to reemerge in these bestial peoples.</p><p>Some of the changed individuals sought more than the life of a simple beast, they hunted larger and larger prey. Eventually they began hunting each other, consuming them, and gaining much more of <a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a>&rsquo;s essence through biomagnification. Their greed began to drive the transformation down a dark path. Their forms became monstrous, and their minds mad. People in the cities watched in horror as half-man-half-beast creatures lurked around their city&rsquo;s outskirts.</p><p>Eventually the hunts began. People from the cities took up arms against these creatures. They began to search for them at night by lanternlight. Those who did so gained the name <a href=/zol/Bloodhunters rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Bloodhunters>Bloodhunters</a>, and the hunted were called <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a>. The affliction itself was dubbed <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a>.</p><p>The <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a> were extremely powerful, and their minds had devolved to madness. It took warriors of equal strength and great determination to slay them. Many warriors began consuming small doses of blood from slain <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a> to increase their physical and magical abilities for a short time. Over-usage of the blood caused a slow, but unstoppable development of <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a>.</p><p>The affliction was furthered by thralls of powerful <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a>. Their power had grown so great, they could overpower the wills of weak mortals, and turn them into beast-like monstrosities that were loyal to them. The thrall&rsquo;s affliction was a strangely contagious thing and it spread quickly as viscous plague.</p><p>The exact method of transference was never determined, but over-exposure to beings that bore the affliction would occasionally cause individuals to succumb to the sickness. Bites and scratches from <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a> seemed to accelerate this, however merely being in proximity to them for too long could cause it. The weaker one&rsquo;s will was, the more likely they would fall victim to the disease. Eventually the condition mutated enough to affect regular beasts as well. <a href=/zol/Bloodhunters rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Bloodhunters>Bloodhunters</a> that fought well seemed largely resistant to the transformation, however they were plagued by maddening thoughts. Academics debated about it being some bloodborne or airborne pathogen. Other&rsquo;s believed the method of transference was magical in nature.</p><p><a href=/zol/Bloodhunters rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Bloodhunters>Bloodhunters</a> who were interviewed by academics spoke of eldritch, nigh incomprehensible knowledge being revealed to them in dreams and visions. However they couldn&rsquo;t put the concepts to words efficiently. This sparked small academic branches, and churches who were obsessed with prospects of beast blood.</p><p><a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a> sought to stop the affliction, but it had taken on a life of its own. <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> was tainted by the plague, and the conflict between mortals and <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a> had turned <a href=/zol/The-Prime rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Prime>The Prime</a> into a nightmarish world since <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a> had become contagious. As the crisis progressed, the people of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> went into hiding. As the ailment spread into the cities. The only solace that the mortal world had, was sunlight. <a href=/zol/Beastmen rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beastmen>Beastmen</a> feared the light of day, and only stalked during the night.</p><a href=#symptoms><h2 id=symptoms><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Symptoms</h2></a><p>The symptoms of <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a>:</p><ul><li>The earliest symptoms are typically nightmares and a feeling of power</li><li>Increased strength, constitution and speed</li><li>Heightened senses</li><li>Extreme hunger</li><li>Aversion of water and sunlight</li><li>Obsession with lanternlight</li><li>Madness</li><li>In its most advanced state, the afflicted will develop any number of beast like traits<ul><li>Fur, scales, amphibian traits, insectoid traits, or feathers</li><li>Glowing eyes</li><li>Sharp teeth</li><li>Horns or antlers</li><li>Claws or hooves</li><li>Elongated limbs</li><li>Quadrupedal mobility</li><li>Extra limbs</li><li>Increase size<ul><li>Some rare cases an afflicted will be over 15 meters in length</li></ul></li><li>In its most powerful state, beings will take on a nightmarish appearance.

However the affliction was still present as thralls roamed <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>. It was thought that <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> would never be rid of <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a>. But one day the spread seemed to halt. Druids later discovered that <a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a> had struck a deal with <a href=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater>The Wasp Eater</a>. <a href=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater>The Wasp Eater</a> had seemingly played a hand in the plagues contagious nature, and had bested <a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a>. Their deal would have the remaining affliction transferred into <a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a>&rsquo;s body, and the spread would cease. <a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a> would then become the servant of <a href=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Wasp-Eater>The Wasp Eater</a>.</p><p><a href=/zol/Kerndall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall>Kerndall</a> was maddened by the affliction, and was dubbed <a href=/zol/Kerndall-the-Feral-King rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kerndall-the-Feral-King>Kerndall, the Feral King</a>. His son <a href=/zol/Ralatas-Prince-of-Beasts rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Ralatas-Prince-of-Beasts>Ralatas, Prince of Beasts</a> took his throne. Slowly, <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> began to return to normalcy.</p><p>Some of the original peoples who abandoned society to live in the forest never gave into the greed and prospects of beast blood.
