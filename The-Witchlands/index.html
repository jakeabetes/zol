Home to beastfolk, bandit, witch and wizard that seek a lifestyle unoffered by the societies of kingdoms. <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a> were were relatively unpopulated by sapient beings at the time of <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>. This allowed for beasts and monsters to claim the region long before the kingdoms could even consider the feat.</p><p>There was a period of time in the mid <a href=/zol/First-Age rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/First-Age>First Age</a> where <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a> attempted this feat, but failed many many times. Eventually it was recognized that taming <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a> was too great a challenge, and no one has since tried to make a kingdom of it.</p><p>Due to its dangerous environment, only the strong and powerful are able to make a sort of home in the region. Either that or an individual needs to be under the protection of a very powerful being. This has made a great home for those who seek to live outside the laws and cultures of normal society.</p><p>The region is taken by naturalists, wildly beastfolk, bandits, outsiders, wizards, and most notably <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a>. Great and powerful wielders of magic have claimed the region in their own sort of way. As the witches of <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">The Cult of the Mothers</a> spin spells in the remote corners of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>, common folk from all of spin tales of the strange things that go on within <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>.</p><a href=#points-of-interest><h2 id=points-of-interest><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Points of Interest</h2></a><ul><li><strong>Godwood Deep</strong> - The deepest extent of the largest forest in all of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>, The Godwood, which spans <a href=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Free-Cities-of-Alderun>The Free Cities of Alderun</a>, <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>, and <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>. Famously dangerous, the Godwood is sometimes referred to as &rsquo;the inside edge of the map&rsquo; as it is largely unexplored and new things are constantly discovered within it.<ul><li><strong>The Alk</strong> - A grand and ancient tree. It is the eldest of its magical, endangered species. The tree emits a protective ward over its local region. Other Alktrees exist throughout the region, however they are extremely rare. Their roots descend remarkably deep into <a href=/zol/The-Underdark rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Underdark>The Underdark</a>. Their wood is said to bring good luck, and almost seems to glow in moonlight. The heartwood of the tree is much stronger than most metals, and is revered in the art of <a href=/zol/Imbuement-Perpetuum rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Imbuement-Perpetuum>Imbuement Perpetuum</a>. Some believe the Alktrees are tied to <a class="internal-link broken">The Great Wall of Roots</a>, but this is mostly based upon folklore. This tree acts as the meeting place for <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a>.</li><li><strong><a href=/zol/The-Alktree-Haven rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Alktree-Haven>The Alktree Haven</a></strong> - A remote convent of like-minded individuals who seek refuge within <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>. Built under the protection of a juvenile Alktree.</li><li><strong>The Greatrocks</strong> - A collection of massive boulders located in the very center of <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>.</li><li><strong>Old Barlen</strong> - A collection of old ruined buildings mysteriously located within Godwood Deep. Not quite a town itself, but almost like a chunk of an old forgotten city. No one knows its origin, but it was discovered during The <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a> Plague. A nest of monsters to be avoided at all costs.</li><li><strong>Pine Valley</strong> - A beautiful valley populated by many <a class="internal-link broken">Beastfolk</a></li><li><strong>Z&rsquo;veril Swamp</strong> - A dangerous swamp that seems to try and swallow anything that enters it.</li><li><strong>Herzal Camp</strong> - A large permanent camp of dangerous bandits known for causing trouble within <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>.</li><li><strong>Robal Camp</strong> - A large permanent camp of anarchistic bandits. Not known to be outwardly aggressive, but are highly territorial.</li></ul></li><li><a href=/zol/Stormwall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormwall>Stormwall</a><ul><li><strong>Mortal Valley</strong> - A cursed place known to be inhabited by Death <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a>.</li></ul></li><li><a href=/zol/Demodemacht rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Demodemacht>Demodemacht</a><ul><li><strong><a class="internal-link broken">Zorberg</a></strong> - A tiny, out of place village tucked into the foothills of <a href=/zol/Demodemacht rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Demodemacht>Demodemacht</a>. This quaint town is kept safe by the <a class="internal-link broken">Great Hearth Witch Luna Elzamore</a>. It is home to the broken outcasts of society she has taken into her care.</li><li><strong>The Caverns of Ghar Nalon</strong> - A complex cave system that goes deep beneath <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>.</li><li><strong>Temple of the Moons</strong> - A mysterious temple located within the peaks of <a href=/zol/Demodemacht rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Demodemacht>Demodemacht</a>. Inhabited by the infamous Sex <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a>. Strangely, even if you know the way to this temple, you can only arrive at dawn. Otherwise it is hidden to any who seek it.</li><li><strong>Axidawn Valley</strong> - The furthest north reaches of <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>. Tucked into the mountains this valley is home to <a class="internal-link broken">The Cult of the Mothers</a>. It is said to be an absurd, and treacherous place.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Everfall</strong> - a large magical forest that is always stuck in a state of autumn. In some places the fallen leaves are piled so deep you can suffocate within them if you are not careful.</li><li><strong>Ghalt Kratur</strong> - A unique crater that was present even before <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>. Made by a massive celestial object from <a href=/zol/The-Cosmos rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Cosmos>The Cosmos</a> that broke through <a class="internal-link broken">The Great Wall of Roots</a>. Not only did the impact leave a fantastic geographical feature, but left a large hole within <a class="internal-link broken">The Great Wall of Roots</a> that allows for academics to perform interstellar observations of <a href=/zol/The-Cosmos rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Cosmos>The Cosmos</a> with a much higher degree of clarity than anywhere else in The Three Corners. Many <a href=/zol/Arcanists rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Arcanists>Arcanists</a> who reside in <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a> make this region their home.<ul><li><strong>The Painted Stones</strong> - A small canyon located within the foothills of <a href=/zol/Demodemacht rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Demodemacht>Demodemacht</a> where the stones are colored vibrantly. It is not know why this is, but some theorize it is an effect of the impact that left the crater. It is now home to many Art <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Purelakes</strong> - A collection of lakes, known to be home to strange creatures. Many believe the waters within the lakes posses magical properties.<ul><li><strong>Lake Urir</strong> - Technically within the borders of <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>.</li><li><strong>The Long Lake</strong> - A slender, seahorse shaped lake that exists at the edge of the swamps.</li><li><strong>The Corkum Pool</strong> - Actually a salt water pool. It is surrounded by hot springs and geysers. The pool itself is not a true hot spring, but is warmer than its neighbors.</li><li><strong>Wizard&rsquo;s Well</strong> - below this lake exists many water filled caves.</li><li><strong>The Axe</strong> - The supposed home of the mythical &lsquo;Adowel, the Great Lake Serpent&rsquo;.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#climate><h2 id=climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Climate</h2></a><p>The area is considered temperate-continental, but Everfall is an exception as the area seems to be locked in a constant state of comfortable autumn weather with bouts of heavy rain.</p><a href=#history-and-inhabitants><h2 id=history-and-inhabitants><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>History and Inhabitants</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a> have always been recognized as a place beyond the means of mere mortals, however there have been the tenacious few who have tried to make claim to it. Only the greatest have been able to do so. The largest organization to try, and fail in claiming it was the kingdom of <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>. They made many attempts at expanding their borders into the Godwood. Many outposts were built, most of which eventually fell to the beasts of the wood. However one has stood against all odds, <a href=/zol/Little-Triumph rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Little-Triumph>Little Triumph</a> remains to this day and has now grown into a small city.</p><p>Only smaller, less organized groups have been able to make a home within <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>. These groups are:</p><ul><li>The <a class="internal-link broken">Beastfolk</a> who rejected violent ways during the <a href=/zol/Beast-Ire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Beast-Ire>Beast Ire</a> plague.</li><li><a href=/zol/Arcanists rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Arcanists>Arcanists</a> who seek solitude. These individuals remain distant from civilization either for personal privacy, or to pursue research that society may deem problematic, dangerous, or dark. These individuals may organize in small groups or remain solitary. Regardless, to defend one&rsquo;s self they must be of above average skill.</li><li>Free thinkers of <a href=/zol/The-Alktree-Haven rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Alktree-Haven>The Alktree Haven</a>. A large convent built only a short distance from <a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a>&rsquo;s border. A union of powerful mages, druids, clergy, and warriors who seek community or refuge outside the region</li><li>The <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a>. A complex and powerful people who have the most widely known reputation of these wilds. <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> are powerful users of magic that span many practices. Each witch is unique in their use of the craft, but all share a rejection of the industrialization of the world. <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> uphold the natural beauty and disorder of things, treasuring nature, art, and the spiritual world. <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> do not subscribe to one singular doctrine, but tend to organize themselves in covens, sisterhoods, convents, and things of the like. Those who practice similar domains of witchcraft typically gravitate towards each other.<ul><li>When the concentration of <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> first grew to such a magnitude that covens used to cross paths into each other, an overarching community was quickly formed. A group called <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a> was formed. 13 groups of witches each agreed on a single member from their smaller practices to represent them. They formed a coven so grand it would unite all witches within the region, a magical powerhouse that could rival kingdoms and would ensure none could bastardize the beauty and freedom of the region.</li><li>However during the late <a href=/zol/First-Age rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/First-Age>First Age</a> an internal struggle began amongst <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a>. 4 of the 13 members had begun to gravitate towards the teachings of a darker magic. That of the <a class="internal-link broken">Hags</a>. The remaining 9 rejected their urgings to seek the eldritch knowledge The <a class="internal-link broken">Hags</a> were thought to posses. So the group was divided. <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a> became 9 and the 4 became <a class="internal-link broken">The Cult of the Mothers</a>.
Despite their divided state, The influence of <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> is undeniably great within the region. The impact made by these groups was the cause for its namesake, <a href=/zol/The-Witchlands rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Witchlands>The Witchlands</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#academics-and-magic><h2 id=academics-and-magic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Academics and Magic</h2></a><p>Informal education is conducted on a surprisingly great scale for a region without cities. <a class="internal-link broken">Witches</a> will teach each other skill and spells, secluded wizards may take the occasional student within their tower, and some students from the various academic institutions are urged to venture out into the region on a pilgrimage to obtain worldly knowledge.</p><p>While their search for knowledge is a common trait, their crafts are not. Amicable groups will commonly spend time with one another to learn what they can. However these groups do not always play nice. Some wizards tend to view the witches as troublesome, uneducated, fickle, or merely and obstacle in their way to greater knowledge. Witches on the other hand view many wizards as problematic, destructive, and tampering with things they do not yet understand. There are frequent bouts of fighting between these groups.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">The Cult of the Mothers</a> has even resorted to fighting in recent years. Their differences have grown too much and <a class="internal-link broken">The Coven</a> fears what <a class="internal-link broken">The Cult of the Mothers</a> may bring into the world.</p><a href=#borders><h2 id=borders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Borders</h2></a><p>The region borders upon:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/Kapesh rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Kapesh>Kapesh</a></li><li><a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a></li><li><a href=/zol/The-Korus-Arctic rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Korus-Arctic>The Korus Arctic</a></li></ul><p>It also contains parts of the mountain ranges:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/Stormwall rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Stormwall>Stormwall</a></li><li><a href=/zol/Demodemacht rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Demodemacht>Demodemacht</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jakeabetes.github.io/zol/js/graph.ea8f7f52d8e39ec9721ab624b31d341f.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacob Turner using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
