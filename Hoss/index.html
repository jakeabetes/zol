This practice was adopted during <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> as a means of turning lesser dragons back against their more powerful enemies. It is an extremely difficult thing to manipulate a dragon in this way, even ones that are of lower cognitive ability. However, a group who called themselves <a class="internal-link broken">Dragonstalkers</a> were determined in the art of draconic manipulation. They spent every hour of their waking lives during the later years of <a href=/zol/The-Dragon-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Dragon-War>The Dragon War</a> focused on the domestication of lesser <a class="internal-link broken">Dragons</a>.

Not as refined as foreign nobility, but obviously more well off than the rest of society. Comprised of the Grand Archon, their supporting council, successful business owners, merchants, and families of long standing wealth. This small group is known for being allowed to do almost anything they want as long as the Grand Archon allows it.</td></tr><tr><td>Commoners</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The general populace. Known as a pragmatic and unpretentious people. They are shipwrights, soldiers, smiths, shop keeps, and many other things of the like. The community that exists amongst them is very close, however they are extremely distrusting of outsiders.</td></tr><tr><td>Peasantry</td><td>Social Class</td><td>Those of lesser means. Farmers, builders, dockworkers, <a class="internal-link broken">Stormdew</a> gatherers, and people of the like. They live difficult, hungry lives jam packed into small homes.

This profession is extremely difficult and dangerous, with a very high mortality rate. These individuals will hatch, raise, or capture lesser dragons. This practice is done both by an organized group or by independent individuals. The former is known as <a class="internal-link broken">The Arendari</a>, a group allied with <a class="internal-link broken">The College of Hoss</a> that is known for their service to the Grand Archon. Some <a class="internal-link broken">Dragonstalkers</a> are also rumored to practice dark rituals, like replacing one&rsquo;s own blood with that of a dragon. Some <a class="internal-link broken">Dragonstalkers</a> will ride their dragon, while others use it more like an attack dog. Originally the only relationship between dragon and dragonstalker was exclusively an abusive one, but now there are some who have close relationships with hatched dragons.

However their reputation in history and rumor is much different. They have been known to push the boundaries of magical practice, pursing dark power. Lower ranking members of the institution present themselves similar to staff and student of other academic institutions like <a class="internal-link broken">Kerketh Academy</a>, but it gets harder and harder to ignore the mysterious nature of the higher ranking members of the college. Many claim they seek the dark sides of necromancy, experiment with the blood of dragons, and commune with eldritch beings.

It is overseen by its 12 masters, each chosen for their prowess in a one of the <a href=/zol/Schools-of-Magic rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Schools-of-Magic>Schools of Magic</a>. One master is voted by the others to act as Grand Master. Currently the Grand Master is Serricus Eidelon, an <a href=/zol/Aarakocra rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Aarakocra>Aarakocra</a> man of black feathers who has long outlived the expected lifespan of his species.
