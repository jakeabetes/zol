Strange radially symmetric plants growing in consistent mathematical patterns, flowers and mushrooms the size of buildings, pebbles that are so light the drift on the air when kicked, and rivers and lakes that are impossibly deep.</p><p>The Reach is very cold due to its northern climate, but does contain some weather patterns and hot springs that allow for lush flora and fauna to survive.</p><a href=#history><h2 id=history><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>History</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> was not discovered by the outside world for some time after <a href=/zol/The-Awakening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Awakening>The Awakening</a>. When rumors began about an <a class="internal-link broken">Off-Human</a> people who have the ability to take any form of their choosing, the dark folk-lore essentially created itself. Common folk began to accuse their friends and family of being &lsquo;<a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>&rsquo; who had killed and eaten their friends and had come to steal their coin.</p><p>Eventually, emissaries from the western world began to interact with The Reach. With increased exposure, the mythos around the <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> began to dissipate a bit. However, the general fear toward the kingdom remained.</p><p>Some brave <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> venture out into the the other kingdoms as proud members of their race, but most who do so under their natural disguise mimicking another of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s <a class="internal-link broken">Races</a>.</p><p>During the late <a href=/zol/First-Age rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/First-Age>First Age</a>, <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> faced a great deal of political infighting. Evidence of this pointed to the interference of <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> masking as important members of western society. <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> began proffering threats towards <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a>. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would be called the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a>.</p><p>Fought in the treacherous Pits of Zeralis, this war increased in intensity over a relatively short period and eventually amounted in the destruction of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> and the emergence of <a class="internal-link broken">Ehmalog, Word of Wrath</a>. A <a href=/zol/Wordbearer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Wordbearer>Wordbearer</a> of unknown origin who protects <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> with his life.</p><p>One of the major results of this war was the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, one of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>. An object so central to the culture of <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> that it has caused irreparable damage to their society and people. In recent times, some of the changelings born within the city of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> do not have the ability to change their form like the vast majority of their race.</p><p>Despite the hardship and discrimination the people of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> have faced, they have gone to great lengths to preserve their way of life. The <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> have succeeded greatly in upholding their culture considering what has happened to them.</p><a href=#inhabitants><h2 id=inhabitants><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inhabitants</h2></a><p>The population of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> is made up of almost entirely <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>. A people with a very reserved, unique culture.</p><p>There are two things one would notice when first arriving in the cities of The Reach:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Formality</strong> - The people of The Reach have very set traditions, and procedures called The Pattern. The Pattern keeps society well mannered, fair, and efficient. The Pattern determines things like how long one should stay at a hosts house after eating dinner, how much one is allowed to drink at a wine house, and even important things like deciding a ruler. Ignoring these formalities is seen as extremely rude, and in many cases infractions against the rules of The Pattern are a punishable offence.</p></li><li><p><strong>True Forms, Pure Forms, and Pure Voice</strong> - <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> posses the ability to alter their physical form to any humanoid shape of their choosing, given they are still of the same approximate size and shape. This alteration is not the use of <a href=/zol/Illusion rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Illusion>Illusion</a> magic like many assume, but actual <a href=/zol/Transmutation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Transmutation>Transmutation</a> of the physical body, even modifying things like sex and metabolism. This create an interesting dynamic where people have the ability to appear however they choose, even as other people. To combat this, as well as introduce some individuality, <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> will often spend their youth conceptualizing an appearance called a <strong>True Form</strong>. A highly unique, detailed, and beautiful appearance that is almost impossible to counterfeit. this form is seen as sacred and is to be respected by all. Ones true form may make them appear as if they are made of translucent crystal, finely made porcelain, woodgrain, or anything one can reasonably imagine. <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> use this form to identify themselves amongst their own society. It is illegal to attempt to counterfeit someone else&rsquo;s True Form, and it is extremely rare one shows their true form outside of The Reach&rsquo;s Cities, especially to outsiders.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> can also be identified by two other means: their <strong>Pure Form</strong>, and Pure <strong>Voice</strong>. These two traits being ones physical appearance at birth, and natural tonality of voice. These are seen as sacred and highly important to the <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>. Some compare showing one&rsquo;s pure form to the concept of nakedness, but it is not quite that. There is no shame in doing so, publicly or privately, but one would not do so without thought.</p><p><strong>Pure Voice</strong> is another category of identification. Since <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> can alter their appearance at will, physical traits are not as treasured when it comes to things like attraction or conventional beauty. However modifying one&rsquo;s voice, especially in a way that is pleasant sounding, is quite difficult for a Changeling. This makes having a beautiful voice an ideal within The Reach&rsquo;s society.</p></li></ul><p>There are also a very small number of non-changeling peoples within The Reach. However these individuals had to go to great lengths to be welcomed into the xenophobic society of <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>. They must follow strict rules and are always viewed as outsiders.</p><a href=#government-economy-and-laws><h2 id=government-economy-and-laws><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government, Economy, and Laws</h2></a><p>The Kingdom of The Reach is governed by 2 individuals (one for each city) known as <a class="internal-link broken">Shardcallers</a>. Each is supported by their own council, all of which are democratically selected and extensively tested for their positions. Those in positions of leadership are viewed in a unique way within The Reach.</p><p>Elected officials are seen as being &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by the people of the city. The live very strict lifestyles where their whole days are scheduled out. Things like dining and recreation time are predetermined for them. Their homes are open to the public (and highly guarded). Citizens can come watch the leadership eat, sleep, and work if they choose to do so. While this sounds demeaning to outsiders it is the highest honor of the <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>. Those who seek these positions spend their entire lives training for the opportunity.</p><p>The <a class="internal-link broken">Shardcallers</a> of The reach are Yemodhan Surrite of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> and Oseur Xetac of <a class="internal-link broken">Corinth</a>.</p><p>The Reach has a socialist approach to its economy, and uses its own denomination of currency called a <a class="internal-link broken">Glassmark</a> which is divided into 4 types of coin.</p><p>The <a class="internal-link broken">Glassian Laws</a> are very strict, but well respected. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> has the lowest crime rate of all the kingdoms.</p><a href=#arts-culture-and-religion><h2 id=arts-culture-and-religion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arts, Culture, and Religion</h2></a><p>Art is very important to the culture of The Reach. Individuals will become career artists to try and encapsulate the many complex factors and ideals within their society. Visual arts like painting are prevalent within the cities, but more commonly artists focus on singing and <a class="internal-link broken">Form Art</a>.</p><p>Singing holds a special importance within The Reach because of the importance of one&rsquo;s Pure Voice. Vocalists will occasionally play with instrumental accompaniment, but more commonly will sing acapella in grand opera-like performances. Frequently done in a theatrical manner.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Form Art</a> is a changeling practice of altering ones own form into beautiful or interesting ways. This is done to express emotions or for general entertainment.</p><p>The general society around The Reach is very strict, utilitarian, well mannered. Individuals will generally try and keep an indifferent demeanor and won&rsquo;t stick their nose into other peoples business. <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> are very proud beings, to offend them is a very quick way to become an outcast.</p><p>The Reach is one of two kingdoms that does not implement <a class="internal-link broken">Trains</a> within its borders. Unlike the other kingdom who does not implement <a class="internal-link broken">Trains</a>, <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>, The Reach does use <a href=/zol/Iron-Light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Iron-Light>Iron Light</a>. They merely have not implemented the infrastructure. The <a href=/zol/Artificers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Artificers>Artificers</a> of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> are behind in terms of advancements due to the isolation they face.</p><a href=#academics-and-magic><h2 id=academics-and-magic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Academics and Magic</h2></a><p>Academics and magic are exclusively taught through formal tutelage. Most youth within The Reach are assigned a tutor, called an Abdector, at a young age that is with them all the way to adulthood. An Abdector holds the same importance as parents do in the culture of <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a>. An Abdector will focus on a main field of study in their teachings. They may teach an individual <a href=/zol/Magic rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Magic>Magic</a>, general academics, economics, art, or a trade. Many students have the opportunity to dabble in various realms given their Abdector is willing and able to teach them. An individual is allowed to choose their own Abdector.</p><p>The Reach also has access to a unique manifestation of the will of <a href=/zol/Observance rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Observance>Observance</a>. This is obtained through interfacing with <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>. What little is understood about this phenomena is extremely well guarded and is not known by many. Those who do have abilities granted by <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a> are quite powerful.</p><a href=#political-climate><h2 id=political-climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Political Climate</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> has faced much destruction in its recent history. The Kingdom has a general hatred for the outside world, especially <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> and <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a>. The much of the The Three Corners returns the same sentiment. The Reach is however a small kingdom compared to its enemies, so it remains well defended in its borders.</p><p>The City of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> faces a grim present. <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, an object central and holy to the city was lost in the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a>. However the importance of this object was so great to these people. They still worship the grounds where it was once held. They leave much of their holy buildings in their war-torn state as a remined of what they faced. Many seek to restore what was lost while others feel that the kingdom needs to change to adapt to the new world.</p><p>Recently, some <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> within the city of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> are born without the ability to alter their form. Many think this is due to the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>.</p><a href=#military><h2 id=military><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Military</h2></a><p>The kingdom has a comparatively small military, but there is no other army who would so willingly die for its kingdom. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> stood its ground for extended battles many times during the <a class="internal-link broken">Western War</a> despite having loosing numbers. This is due to the highly defensible position, and extremely hostile environment that does not favor outsiders. It also helps that <a class="internal-link broken">Changelings</a> can appear as their foes for ambush attacks. The kingdom has a relatively small navy as well, but they are not very vulnerable to sea based attacks due to the rough seas near Zhal.</p><a href=#borders><h2 id=borders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Borders</h2></a><p>The Reach borders the kingdom of:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> via the <a class="internal-link broken">Wrath Wastes</a></li></ul><p>It also borders the wilds of:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/The-Blades rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Blades>The Blades</a> mountain range</li><li><a href=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira>The Peaks of Myth&rsquo;ira</a></li><li><a href=/zol/Holyfield rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Holyfield>Holyfield</a></li></ul><p>and has its coast on:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea>The Narrow Sea</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jakeabetes.github.io/zol/js/graph.ea8f7f52d8e39ec9721ab624b31d341f.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacob Turner using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
