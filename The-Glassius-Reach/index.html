When rumors began about an <a href=/zol/Off-Human rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Off-Human>Off-Human</a> people who have the ability to take any form of their choosing, the grim folk-lore essentially created itself. Common folk began to accuse their friends and family of being &lsquo;<a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>&rsquo; who had killed and eaten their friends. A hidden threat that had come to their city to steal faces and coins.</p><p>Eventually, emissaries from the western world began to interact with The Reach. With increased exposure, the mythos around the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> began to dissipate a bit. However, the public fear toward the kingdom remained.</p><p>Some brave <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> venture out into the the other kingdoms as proud members of their race, but most who do so under their natural disguise mimicking another of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s <a href=/zol/Races rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Races>Races</a>. Their disguises a necessary precaution against many of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s foreigners.</p><p>During the late <a href=/zol/First-Age rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/First-Age>First Age</a>, <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> faced a great deal of political infighting. Evidence of this pointed to the interference of <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> masking as important members of western society. <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> and <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> began proffering threats towards <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a>. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> denied these claims. When the supposed sabotage did not stop, the nations declared a war that would grow to fame as the <a href=/zol/Western-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Western-War>Western War</a>.</p><p>Fought mostly in the treacherous Pits of Zeralis, this war increased in intensity over a relatively short period and eventually amounted in the destruction of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> and the emergence of <a href=/zol/The-Word-of-Wrath rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Word-of-Wrath>The Word of Wrath</a>. A <a href=/zol/Wordbearer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Wordbearer>Wordbearer</a> of unknown origin who protects <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> with his life.</p><p>One of the major results of this war was the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, one of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>. An object so central to the culture of <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> that it has caused irreparable damage to their religion and culture. One recent example of this is some <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> born within the city of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> do not have the ability to change their form.</p><p>Despite the hardship and discrimination the people of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> have faced, they have gone to great lengths to preserve their way of life. The <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> have succeeded well in upholding their culture considering what has happened to them.</p><a href=#inhabitants><h2 id=inhabitants><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inhabitants</h2></a><p>The population of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> is made up of almost entirely <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. A people with a very reserved, unique culture.</p><p>There are two things one would notice when first arriving in the cities of The Reach:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Formality</strong> - The people of The Reach have very set traditions, and procedures called <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. The Pattern keeps society well mannered, fair, and efficient. The Pattern determines things like how long one should stay at a host&rsquo;s house after eating dinner, how much one is allowed to drink at a wine house, and even important things like deciding a ruler. Ignoring these formalities is seen as extremely rude, and in many cases infractions against the rules of <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a> are a punishable offence. The pattern stems from the influence of <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a> seeming to favor some individuals more than others. Over many generations scholars and philosophers have tried to determine the factors that cause this favor. The resulting research is what shaped <a href=/zol/The-Pattern rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Pattern>The Pattern</a>. It is half based in empirical evidence, and half in personal belief. It is a thing debated by many.</p></li><li><p><strong>True Forms, Pure Forms, and Pure Voice</strong> - <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> posses the ability to alter their physical form to any humanoid shape of their choosing, given they are still of the same approximate size and shape. This alteration is not the use of <a href=/zol/Illusion rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Illusion>Illusion</a> magic like many assume, but actual <a href=/zol/Transmutation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Transmutation>Transmutation</a> of the physical body, even modifying things like sex and metabolism, and the very <a href=/zol/Matter rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Matter>Matter</a> they are made from. This creates an interesting dynamic where people have the ability to appear however they choose, and can even mask as other people. To combat the obvious challenges this poses, as well as introduce a concept of individuality, <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> will often spend their youth conceptualizing an appearance called a <strong>True Form</strong>. A highly unique, detailed, and beautiful appearance that is very difficult to counterfeit. This form is seen as sacred, and is to be respected by all other <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. One&rsquo;s true form may make them appear as if they are made of translucent crystal, finely made porcelain, woodgrain, or anything one can reasonably imagine. <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> use this form to identify themselves amongst their own society. It is illegal to attempt to counterfeit someone else&rsquo;s True Form, and it is extremely rare one shows their true form outside of The Reach&rsquo;s Cities, especially to outsiders.</p><p><a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> can also be identified by two other means: their <strong>Pure Form</strong>, and Pure <strong>Voice</strong>. These two traits being ones physical appearance at birth, and natural tonality of voice. These are seen as sacred and highly important to the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. Some compare showing one&rsquo;s pure form to the concept of nakedness, but it is not quite that. There is no shame in doing so, publicly or privately, but one would not do so without thought the same way one would not wear a wedding gown at a funeral. The occasion must be fitting.</p><p><strong>Pure Voice</strong> is another category of identification. Since <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> can alter their appearance at will, physical traits are not as treasured when it comes to things like attraction or conventional beauty. However modifying one&rsquo;s voice, especially in a way that is pleasant sounding, is quite difficult for a Changeling. This makes having a beautiful voice an ideal within The Reach&rsquo;s society.</p></li></ul><p>There are also a very small number of non-changeling peoples within The Reach. However these individuals had to go to great lengths to be welcomed into the xenophobic society of <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. They must follow strict rules and are always viewed as outsiders.</p><a href=#government-economy-and-laws><h2 id=government-economy-and-laws><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government, Economy, and Laws</h2></a><p>The Kingdom of The Reach is governed by 2 individuals (one for each city) known as <a href=/zol/Shardcallers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Shardcallers>Shardcallers</a>. Each is supported by their own council, all of which are democratically elected and extensively tested for their positions. Those in positions of leadership are viewed in a unique way within The Reach.</p><p>Elected officials are seen as being &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by the people of the city. The live very strict lifestyles where their whole days are scheduled out. Things like dining and recreation time are predetermined for them. Their homes are open to the public (and highly guarded). Citizens can come watch the leadership eat, sleep, and work if they choose to do so. While this sounds demeaning to outsiders it is the highest honor of the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>. Those who seek these positions spend their entire lives training for the opportunity.</p><p>The <a href=/zol/Shardcallers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Shardcallers>Shardcallers</a> of The reach are Yemodhan Surrite of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> and Osieur Xetac of <a href=/zol/Corinth rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Corinth>Corinth</a>.</p><p>The Reach has a socialist approach to its economy, and uses its own denomination of crystalline currency called a Glassmark which is divided into 4 types of coin:</p><ul><li><strong>Quartermark</strong> - A small clear crystal cut into hexagons from quartz called, bearing similar value to a copper coin</li><li><strong>Halfmark</strong> - A medium sized yellow crystal cut into pentagons from citrine, bearing similar value to a silver coin</li><li><strong>Nearmark</strong> - A medium sized green crystal cut into squares from fluorite, bearing similar value to a gold coin</li><li><strong>Fullmark</strong> - A large sized opaque crystal cut into triangles from celestine, bearing similar value to a platinum coin</li></ul><p>The <a href=/zol/Glassian-Laws rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Glassian-Laws>Glassian Laws</a> are very strict, but well respected by most. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> at one time, had the lowest crime rate of all the kingdoms. Now that has begun to change with the many years of hardship in <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a>.</p><a href=#arts-culture-and-religion><h2 id=arts-culture-and-religion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arts, Culture, and Religion</h2></a><p>Art is very important to the culture of The Reach. Individuals will become career artists to try and encapsulate the many complex factors and ideals within their society. Visual arts like painting are prevalent within the cities, but more commonly artists focus on singing and <a href=/zol/Form-Art rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Form-Art>Form Art</a>.</p><p>Singing holds a special importance within The Reach because of the importance of one&rsquo;s Pure Voice. Vocalists will occasionally play with instrumental accompaniment, but more commonly will sing acapella in grand opera-like performances. Frequently done in a theatrical manner.</p><p><a href=/zol/Form-Art rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Form-Art>Form Art</a> is a changeling practice of altering ones own form into beautiful or interesting ways. This is done to express emotions or for general entertainment.</p><p>The general society around The Reach is very strict, utilitarian, well mannered. Individuals will generally try and keep an indifferent demeanor and won&rsquo;t stick their nose into other peoples business. <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> are very proud beings, to offend them is a very quick way to become an outcast.</p><p>The Reach is one of two kingdoms that does not implement <a href=/zol/Trains rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Trains>Trains</a> within its borders. Unlike the other kingdom who does not implement <a href=/zol/Trains rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Trains>Trains</a>, <a href=/zol/The-Ward rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Ward>The Ward</a>, The Reach does use <a href=/zol/Iron-Light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Iron-Light>Iron Light</a>.

The <a href=/zol/Artificers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Artificers>Artificers</a> of <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> are behind in terms of advancements due to the isolation they face.</p><a href=#academics-and-magic><h2 id=academics-and-magic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Academics and Magic</h2></a><p>Academics and magic are exclusively taught through <a href=/zol/The-Eelynn rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Eelynn>The Eelynn</a>, a college of two campuses with one in each city. These schools offer teaching to all youth ages 5-18. Those who are promising academics may go further in their scholarship, pursuing magic and/or greater studies.</p><p>The Reach also has access to a unique manifestation of the will of <a href=/zol/Observance rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Observance>Observance</a>. This is obtained through interfacing with <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a>. What little is understood about this phenomena is extremely well guarded and is not known by many. Those who do have abilities granted by <a href=/zol/The-Oldshards rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Oldshards>The Oldshards</a> are quite powerful.</p><a href=#political-climate><h2 id=political-climate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Political Climate</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> has faced much destruction in its recent history.

The Reach is however a small kingdom compared to its enemies, so it remains well defended in its borders.</p><p>The City of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> faces a grim present. <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>, an object central and holy to the city was lost in the <a href=/zol/Western-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Western-War>Western War</a>. However the importance of this object was so great to these people. They still worship the grounds where it was once held. They leave much of their holy buildings in their war-torn state as a remined of what they faced. Many seek to restore what was lost while others feel that the kingdom needs to change to adapt to the new world.</p><p>Recently, some <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> within the city of <a href=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Yorn-et-Gaul>Yorn et Gaul</a> are born without the ability to alter their form. Many think this is due to the loss of <a href=/zol/The-Apex rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Apex>The Apex</a>.</p><a href=#military><h2 id=military><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Military</h2></a><p>The kingdom has a comparatively small military, but there is no other army who would so willingly die for its kingdom. <a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> stood its ground for extended battles many times during the <a href=/zol/Western-War rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Western-War>Western War</a> despite having loosing numbers. This is due to the highly defensible position, and extremely hostile environment that does not favor outsiders. It also helps that <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a> can appear as their foes for ambush attacks. The kingdom has a relatively small navy as well, but they are not very vulnerable to sea based attacks due to the rough seas near Zhal.</p><a href=#borders><h2 id=borders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Borders</h2></a><p>The Reach borders the kingdom of:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> via the <a href=/zol/Wrath-Wastes rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Wrath-Wastes>Wrath Wastes</a></li></ul><p>It also borders the wilds of:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/The-Blades rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Blades>The Blades</a> mountain range</li><li><a href=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Peaks-of-Mythira>The Peaks of Myth&rsquo;ira</a></li><li><a href=/zol/Holyfield rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Holyfield>Holyfield</a></li></ul><p>and has its coast on:</p><ul><li><a href=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Narrow-Sea>The Narrow Sea</a></li></ul><a href=#mimics><h2 id=mimics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mimics</h2></a><p><a href=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Glassius-Reach>The Glassius Reach</a> is not only home to the <a href=/zol/Changelings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Changelings>Changelings</a>, but it is also home to the strange, and powerful <a href=/zol/Mimics rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Mimics>Mimics</a>.
