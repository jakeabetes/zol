Populated by the proud High Elves, the city is ancient, and resplendent. Surrounded by the lush forest of Yan Nalora, the city is harmonious with the local nature. Its citizens carry a deep love and respect for both their city, and territory. It is one of the many cities within <a href=/zol/Gethsemane rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gethsemane>Gethsemane</a> that is very hard for outsiders to reach, as <a href=/zol/The-Great-Tracks rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Great-Tracks>The Great Tracks</a> do not contain it within its routes.

A sort of utopia for its people. Everything has been designed and thought out to the greatest detail. Citizens spend their whole lives honing a single skill to a level of mastery that surpasses most anything seen across The Three Corners. Those who fit into the social structure of the city, have some of the highest quality-of-living in all of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a></td></tr><tr><td>Main Challenge</td><td>To maintain such a perfect utopian city, many rules have to be implemented at every level. Religious regulations, cultural rules, and judicial laws are placed all throughout the city&rsquo;s society. Actual laws are enforced by the city&rsquo;s leadership, but the vast majority of restrictions placed upon an individual come from the general populace. One may face serious consequences if they are known for noisy disruptions, rude behavior, disrespect of nature, and things of the like. Citizens can exercise the Right of Zsar Daeum, a legal process where a group of 15 or more citizens can call a legal trial for poor behavior of another citizen. If found guilty, the punishment may involve things as light as a public apology, or as grave as banishment from the city. While this right is rarely exercised upon neighbors, its existence shapes the behavior of its citizens. However the law has special implications for outsiders, where the right can be exercised by as few as 3 citizens and usually has graver consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate</td><td>Temperate</td></tr><tr><td>Cuisine</td><td>Fruits, Wine, Farmed Vegetables, Wild Game, Freshwater Fish</td></tr><tr><td>Export</td><td>Art, High Quality Hand-crafted Goods, Wine</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Large</td></tr><tr><td>City Leader</td><td>Maer Liordan Re&rsquo;aan</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Language(s)</td><td>Elvish</td></tr><tr><td>Majority Racial Group(s)</td><td>High <a class="internal-link broken">Elves</a></td></tr><tr><td>Majority Religion(s)</td><td>Trinity-Centric</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#major-features><h2 id=major-features><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Major Features</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Distinguishing Features</td><td>Forested, Hilly, Riverside</td></tr><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Large Elegant Towers, Complex Detailing, Divine Proportions</td></tr><tr><td>Color(s)</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Symbolism</td><td>A circle of 9 birch leaves</td></tr><tr><td>Defenses</td><td>Very high walls, territory dangerous to outsiders, master archers, hybrid fleet</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#people-groups><h2 id=people-groups><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>People Groups</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High Court</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The most highly respected members of the city.
