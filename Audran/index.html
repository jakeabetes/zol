Seen by all of <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a> as a beacon of light and wonder. So large you could not walk from end to end in a day, not counting getting lost or stopping. Its wonderous empire stood proud for many generations, until one of the darkest days in <a href=/zol/Zol rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Zol>Zol</a>&rsquo;s history: The Day of Madness.</p><p>The Day of Madness was a sudden event that involved <a href=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies>The Castle of Bodies</a> suddenly attacking <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a>. Until that point, no one even knew <a href=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies>The Castle of Bodies</a> existed. Its presence drove the vast majority of the city&rsquo;s people into a blood frenzy. People blindly fought, killed and destroyed anything they could. The whole event only lasted a short while, but wholly ruined the city and its people.</p><p>The capital was abandoned, but slowly over time people returned and sought refuge in its ruins. Disorganized and ramshackle rebuilding began. Eventually, the combined efforts of many created a new and unique place where the great city once stood. It would never become the capital again, but is now home to a very unique, rich, and diverse culture.</p><p><div class=container><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-/zol/audran.png><label for=zoomCheck-/zol/audran.png><img src=/zol/audran.png width=auto></label></div></p><p>One part ruined, one part rebuilt, one part ramshackle slum.

It is a city by the people, and for the people. Despite the many attempts by the crown to instill order within <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a>, it remains chaotic and free. It is a place where anything, good or bad, can occur.</td></tr><tr><td>Main Challenge</td><td>Governing the city is extremely difficult. Its ever-sprawling, overcrowded streets make a perfect environment for crime and chaos. Straying where one should not within <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a> is very dangerous.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate</td><td>Temperate</td></tr><tr><td>Cuisine</td><td>Cultivated Fruits, Farmed Goods, Flatbread and rice based meals</td></tr><tr><td>Export</td><td>Investments, medicine, coffee, dyes, textiles, paper, books, and ink</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Massive</td></tr><tr><td>Outer Villages</td><td>Many</td></tr><tr><td>City Leader</td><td>High Lord Beld Bordana</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Language(s)</td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td>Majority Racial Group(s)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Majority Religion(s)</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#major-features><h2 id=major-features><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Major Features</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Distinguishing Features</td><td>A massive lakeside city, textured with aged destruction that has been used as a foundation for new structure.</td></tr><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>A ramshackle, half-destroyed city. New buildings of differing materials and styles have been erected using the ruins of the ancient destruction as foundations. Some buildings have a strange half old stone, half new lumber look. Others are entirely new, and many remain with entire sections missing. To accommodate the large population, tents and other makeshift structures can be found everywhere one can logically (and sometimes illogically) be placed.</td></tr><tr><td>Color(s)</td><td>Purple, Grey, and Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Symbolism</td><td>A tower with a window in the shape of an arched door</td></tr><tr><td>Defenses</td><td>High walls</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#people-groups><h2 id=people-groups><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>People Groups</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nobility</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The wealthy members of <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a> society. However these nobles are not like nobility of other cities half made up of conventional nobles of good rapport, and half made up of eclectic individuals who made some great success in the city. These two types of nobles blend in court to create a fast paced, gossip-filled knot within society.</td></tr><tr><td>Commoners</td><td>Social Class</td><td>The working class of the city. Poverty can move like waves through the fluid economy of the city. It is always a challenge for the common folk to keep their heads above water.</td></tr><tr><td>Beggars</td><td>Social Class</td><td>Individuals who could not keep up with, or getting a foot hold within the city&rsquo;s merciless environment. Many beggars exist within the city. Life is hard and competitive amongst this class.</td></tr><tr><td>Slaves</td><td>Social Class</td><td>Those charged with significant crimes who are forced to work and serve in recompense.</td></tr><tr><td>Criminals</td><td>Criminal</td><td>A massive criminal network exists within the city. Many gangs, alliances, and rivalries fill the alleys of the city with violence and thievery. The underbelly of <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a> is a world of its own, and must be traversed carefully. Its structure is nearly as complex and ever changing as its noble courts. Some of its major players are: The Roving Gang, The Tiefling Mafia, The Unruly, The Nakaza, and many more.</td></tr><tr><td>Inquisitors</td><td>Law Enforcement</td><td>A class of highly trained individuals from <a href=/zol/The-First-Bastion rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-First-Bastion>The First Bastion</a>, sent to bring order to the city. These high ranking members of the city guard aim to clean up the streets and eliminate crime. However they have been at it for quite some time with little net change.</td></tr><tr><td>Students</td><td>Academic Station</td><td>Students who attend <a href=/zol/Jhenbridge rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Jhenbridge>Jhenbridge</a>, an academic institution of the <a href=/zol/Arcanum rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Arcanum>Arcanum</a>, a branch of <a href=/zol/The-University rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-University>The University</a>.

Located within the keep.</td></tr><tr><td>Upper District</td><td>Inner-walled District</td><td>An inner walled section of the city that has been entirely restored. Home to the highest degree of nobility, shops, and taverns.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=/zol/Jhenbridge rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Jhenbridge>Jhenbridge</a></td><td>College</td><td>An academic institution of <a href=/zol/The-University rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-University>The University</a> that exists as the most well-known manifestation of the <a href=/zol/Arcanum rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Arcanum>Arcanum</a>. At this institution, anyone can obtain an education at no cost for their first year. However if they wish to have a long and fruitful academic career, they must perform well in their classes, and commit many hours of work to <a href=/zol/The-University rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-University>The University</a>. Located in Charside.</td></tr><tr><td>Pulp Markets</td><td>Market</td><td>A market frequented by students</td></tr><tr><td>Port Squares</td><td>Market</td><td>The markets located closet to the lakeports</td></tr><tr><td>Tent Alleys</td><td>Market</td><td>The many many markets located all over the city in narrow alleyways that sell things that would surprise even the <a href=/zol/Gods rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Gods>Gods</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>The Upper Market</td><td>Market</td><td>The fine market located in the upper district</td></tr><tr><td>Zalp&rsquo;s</td><td>Tavern</td><td>A tavern loved by many-a-student</td></tr><tr><td>The Surviving Inn</td><td>Tavern</td><td>A tavern built in a structure that withstood The Day of Madness. Very beloved amongst commoners</td></tr><tr><td>The Adorian</td><td>Tavern</td><td>A fine alehouse in the upper district where many skilled performers will attend</td></tr><tr><td>Quiet Peter&rsquo;s</td><td>Tavern</td><td>A shady tavern located in the basement of a mostly ruined building in Catyard. Known as a sort of demilitarized zone amongst the local criminal groups where fighting of any sort is not allowed.</td></tr><tr><td>The Dens</td><td>Tavern</td><td>A name for the many pop up tent based taverns one finds only in <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#authority><h2 id=authority><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Authority</h2></a><p>The city is ruled by High Lord Beld Bordana.

As the capital of <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a>, it acted as a hub of commerce, politics, academia, and culture. This beacon of hope changed instantly when <a href=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies>The Castle of Bodies</a> suddenly appeared in the sky on The Day of Madness.</p><p>Before the event, none knew of <a href=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/The-Castle-of-Bodies>The Castle of Bodies</a>&rsquo; existence. One of the strange <a href=/zol/Void-Gods rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Void-Gods>Void Gods</a>, with a particular goal of random destruction.</p><p>When it appeared, it blocked out the sun and exercised its influence on the minds of <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a>&rsquo;s people. Almost all who were exposed to it were immediately pushed to madness and violence. The city quickly became a bloody riot. Friend turned on friend as everyone within began to do all they could to destroy the city and its people.</p><p>Brave heroes dispatched themselves as quickly as they could, luckily none of which were driven mad upon arrival, as it seemed the cognitive effect from the Void God was only exercised at its moment of arrival. They fought the Void God, as it dispatched an army of monstrous demons with horrific physiology from within its body.</p><p>The heroes did all they could to wound the strange being, in a manner similar to razing a city. Then without warning, the city vanished.</p><p>Those who were driven mad by it suddenly regained their senses, but the damage had been done. In a matter of hours <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a> was put to ruins. The memory of the event left the city with the brand of being cursed.</p><p>The vast majority left the city, and it remained a ghost town for generations. However, a fair portion of its buildings were reasonably intact. Eventually, the wounds turned to scars, people began to return to the city.</p><p>Originally only unorganized factions of bandits, forlorn, and nomads. As more people arrived a society naturally began to reform. After a few generations, the governing bodies of <a href=/zol/Laenwalde rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Laenwalde>Laenwalde</a> recognized it as a city once again.</p><p>It had been rebuilt to a degree.

The attack was deemed as a freak occurrence, and people began to call <a href=/zol/Audran rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/zol/Audran>Audran</a> home again.
